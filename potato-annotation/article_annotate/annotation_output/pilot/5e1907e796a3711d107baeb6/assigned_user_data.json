surprise.\n</span>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty far behind the curve. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not where we wanted to be,\u201d said Eric Rosengren, who as president of the Boston Fed until last September had a hand in designing those policies.\n</span>In some ways, Mr. Powell\u2019s challenge is thornier than it was at the outset of the pandemic. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No Fed chairman since Paul Volcker in the early 1980s has had to grapple with inflation this high.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The risk for Mr. Powell and the nation is that his fight against inflation will cause a new recession, as Mr. Volcker\u2019s did.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Historically, the Fed hasn\u2019t been able to push down inflation without a recession.\n</span>Exactly how Mr. Powell intends to tighten policy represents an additional challenge. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The Fed has both the traditional lever of short-term interest rates and a newfangled one: shrinking its vast holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">This could be especially treacherous for markets accustomed to a central bank that for the past two decades mostly used just interest rates, and tried to telegraph how fast it would raise them.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Fed officials warn they can\u2019t provide that same predictability this time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For markets \u201cit could be a bumpy time,\u201d said Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In less than a year, the Fed went from projecting no interest rate increases <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 2024 to</span> signaling it will raise rates at its next meeting, March 15-16, for the first time <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2018.</span></span> Then just in the past week, investors have begun anticipating a half-point instead of quarter-point increase at that meeting, which would be the first one that big <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2000.</span>\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">No past Fed chair has had to deal with a shutdown of the U.S.\u2019s economy and those of trading partners, as Mr. Powell confronted.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">A great deal hangs on issues outside of his control, including to what extent the virus recedes, how quickly supply chains heal and how much working arrangements and spending preferences revert to pre-pandemic patterns.\n</span>Mr. Powell has been nominated by President Biden for a second term and is expected to win bipartisan backing in the Senate confirmation vote. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Republicans delayed a scheduled confirmation vote in the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, objecting to one of Mr. Biden\u2019s other Fed picks.</span> All but one of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 Democrats</span> on the panel indicated they would support Mr. Powell once the vote occurs.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">When the pandemic hit in <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020,</span> Mr. Powell ran through a crisis-fighting playbook from former Chairman Ben Bernanke and then added new pages, doing things the Fed had never done before, such as making loans directly to cities, states, and businesses.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Though the worst of the financial crisis had passed by June, the economic situation was still bleak.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Unemployment peaked <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 14.7%,</span> which didn\u2019t include millions of Americans who\u2019d left the workforce.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 2020,</span> Mr. Powell led his colleagues to adopt a policy framework designed to address a problem that had long dogged the Fed and other central banks, and that the pandemic threatened to worsen: inflation running persistently below <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2% target</span>.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Under the Fed\u2019s old framework, it would raise interest rates pre-emptively.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Rather than wait until inflation was <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above 2%,</span> it would act when unemployment was falling, to prevent inflation from <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 2%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The new framework rejected pre-emptive strikes on inflation.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">To put this new framework into action, they pledged in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2020 to</span> maintain rates near zero until labor-market conditions were consistent with maximum employment\u2014which wasn\u2019t fully defined but generally corresponds with historically low levels of unemployment\u2014and until inflation <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 2% and</span> headed higher.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">To further hasten the fall in unemployment, the Fed would <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy $120 billion</span> in Treasurys and mortgage bonds each month.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The goal was to send investors into riskier assets, buoying stocks, corporate bonds and real estate by lowering long-term interest rates.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">In theory, buying longer-dated securities would reduce what economists call a \u201cterm premium,\u201d or the extra yield investors demand for the risk of lending over a long term.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The Fed and many private-sector economists were caught off guard by how the economy responded as it reopened last year.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Unemployment fell much more quickly than expected\u2014<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% last</span> month <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 5.9% in</span> June.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Wages ratcheted steadily higher as employers faced shortages of labor.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Inflation surged last spring, driven by brisk demand for goods and by shipping bottlenecks and shortages for intermediate goods such as semiconductors.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Fed officials attributed the surge to idiosyncratic increases in the prices of a handful of items tied to reopening the economy, which they thought would be short-lived.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Instead, price pressures broadened.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Few economists, inside or outside the Fed, imagined such a large surge in inflation when the new framework was adopted.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Yet Fed officials felt compelled to hold rates at zero and continue adding to their bond portfolio to adhere to their guidance laid down for reaching maximum employment.\n</span>\u201cThat guidance, in retrospect, does not look like it was ideal,\u201d said Mr. Rosengren.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Additionally, Mr. Powell and his colleagues were slow to revise their forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates after President Biden signed <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.9 trillion</span> fiscal stimulus bill into law in <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2021,</span> though a handful of economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, warned the spending could feed inflation.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">On the heels of <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $900 billion</span> measure former President Donald Trump approved at the end <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> that boost in retrospect should \u201chave set their antennas quivering more than it did,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman.\n</span>By late last summer, Mr. Powell began to pivot. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">In November he initiated a plan to reduce the Fed\u2019s monthly bond buying to zero over eight months, clearing the way to raise rates by mid-2022.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">But the labor market was tightening fast, and inflation pressures, rather than easing, broadened.</span> In December, Mr. Powell said the purchases would end by March, allowing rate rises to begin immediately after.\nFor the central bank, it was an uncharacteristic about-face. \u201cAs the data came in, they said, \u2018We were wrong.\u2019 <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">How often do you hear the Fed say that?\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n</span>Despite the quick shift, the policy response still had room to catch up, Mr. Kohn said. <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">As recently as December, Fed officials continued to signal they would tighten monetary policy much as they had in the past: with a mild path of rate increases over the next three years.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">They premised that on inflation falling <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%,</span> even though they expected growth and unemployment to run at levels that would apply upward pressure on inflation.\n</span>\u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t add up,\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell seemed to acknowledge as much at a news conference after the Fed\u2019s meeting last month.</span> He hinted at a faster path of rate increases and declined to rule out raising rates at consecutive policy meetings, which hasn\u2019t happened <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2006,</span> or by a half percentage point at once. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to say exactly how this is going to go,\u201d he said.\nThat marks an important break from rate-rise cycles that began <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004 and</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> and it could make the current cycle more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 1994.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">That year, after a prolonged period of low, stable rates, the Fed under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan raised <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rates 3 percentage</span> points in a one-year span.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">The unexpectedly rapid tightening hammered bond prices more than almost any other move in the postwar era.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt and Mexico devalued its peso, ravaging its economy.</span> <span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered rates modestly <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995 amid</span> fears the economy might slide into recession.\n</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Greenspan again prepared to raise rates <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> he incorporated the advice of Mr. Bernanke, an accomplished academic and then a Fed governor, who said that clearer guidance about the Fed\u2019s goals and intentions could lead to more effective policy.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">\u201cAmbiguity has its uses, but mostly in noncooperative games like poker,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told colleagues <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003,</span> according to transcripts of a Fed policy meeting that year.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">\u201cMonetary policy is a cooperative game.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">The whole point is to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">At their meeting next month, Fed officials will release new projections showing how much they expect to lift rates.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">Thus far, their goal has been to raise them to \u201cneutral,\u201d a level that neither spurs nor slows growth, which officials estimate is <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3% when</span> inflation is near the Fed\u2019<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% target</span>.</span> Unlike in recent years, and a departure from Mr. Bernanke\u2019s guidance, how fast they get there and whether they go higher remain open questions.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Officials are hoping inflation declines as supply problems ease and demand shifts from goods, where prices rose sharply last year, toward services, where inflation has been less extreme.\n</span>There\u2019s plenty that could go wrong. <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Inflation might stay high because of factors outside of the Fed\u2019s control, such as a Russian invasion of Ukraine that roils energy markets, or shipping delays made worse by pandemic-driven lockdowns in Asia.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">And even if prices of goods moderate this year as expected, increases in wages and rents could keep inflation elevated <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">into 2023.</span>\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell has for now declined to provide so-called forward guidance about the policy path because the inflation outlook is so uncertain.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The uncertainty over inflation and lack of Fed guidance is leading to greater volatility in bond markets.</span> Until last Thursday, officials played down the prospect of starting with a half-point rate increase or acting between regularly scheduled policy meetings.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">\u201cI prefer not to be deploying that kind of stuff if we can avoid it, and so far, I think we\u2019ve got a smooth response to the inflation surprise,\u201d said James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, in a Feb.<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7 interview</span>.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">After Thursday\u2019s report that inflation had climbed further to a 40-year high <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7.5%,</span> Mr. Bullard changed his message, telling Bloomberg News that he would favor a bolder, half-point increase or an inter-meeting rate increase in the coming months.\n</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">His remarks accelerated the largest one-day jump in two-year Treasury bond yields <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2009 and</span> led futures markets to bet on a half-point increase next month.\n</span>If Mr. Powell and his colleagues deliver such a move, they could be criticized for panicking. <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">If he opts for the smaller increase, he could be criticized for not taking inflation seriously enough.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">\u201cIdeally, the Fed would come out and exert control of the policy message,\u201d including by saying it will raise rates in a fashion that doesn\u2019t inflame fears of an emergency, said Brian Sack, who ran the New York Fed\u2019s markets desk <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 to</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 and</span> is now the director of economics at hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Market speculation that the Fed might raise rates in between meetings, which intensified after Mr. Bullard\u2019s remarks, fanned fears that policy isn\u2019t well positioned to restrain the economy and bring down inflation, analysts said.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Complicating its deliberations, the Fed has more than one way of tightening policy by shrinking its bondholdings, which have more than doubled <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $9 trillion</span> since <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">When the Fed shrank its holdings <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2017 and</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> it did so passively by allowing a certain amount of securities to mature without replacing them every month.</span> <span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">Some Fed officials, uncomfortable with having such a big presence in Treasurys, the world\u2019s most important financial market, believe high inflation calls for a faster retreat by actively selling assets to raise longer-term rates.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">Ms. George, the Kansas City Fed leader, and Mr. Rosengren advocate that more aggressive path.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials are cool to that, at least for now.</span> <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re adjusting policy substantially in other ways, introducing asset sales just complicates the path,\u201d said Mr. Sack.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of pouring fuel on the fire. The balance sheet is an instrument with still-uncertain effects, and you don\u2019t want to push it too hard.\u201d\n<span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">For now, that also appears to be the predominant view at the Fed.</span> Mr. Powell said last month he wants the program to run in the background. <span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">It would function more like the rhythm section in a band, allowing the Fed to move its benchmark rate up or down if it wants to adjust policy.\n</span>Looming over this is the reaction of the markets. Stocks, corporate bonds and real estate all reached historically high valuations in part on the assumption rates would remain very low for years. <span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Though household borrowing as a share of U.S. gross domestic product is well below levels reached during the housing boom of 2004-06, corporate debt is near a record high.\n</span><span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere are people who are living in a world in which an aggressive Fed tightening\u2014an increasing possibility here\u2014is not an outcome they can accept, so they\u2019re pretending it won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners.</span> \u201cThe places where that\u2019s very real\u2014cryptocurrency, tech-related companies in private equity\u2014could be in deep trouble.\u201d\n<span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">Once there\u2019s a sharp decline in one of those sectors, that could set off volatility in other corners of the market, he said.\n</span><span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">Share Your Thoughts\nIs the Fed doing the right things to handle inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.\n<span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">Mr. Rosengren said the prospect of a soft landing for the economy has diminished over the past six months because of more persistent supply shocks and workers winning higher wages to offset higher prices.\n</span><span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Rapidly raising rates to address the inflation problem increases the risks of a recession, he said.</span> <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you\u2019re raising rates rapidly, you don\u2019t have time to see how the rate increases you\u2019ve already done have slowed down the economy,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"81\" class=\"red\">One danger is that the Fed faces a bind where inflation only partially reverses its recent climb.</span> <span id=\"82\" class=\"red\">That would leave officials forced to choose between accepting a somewhat higher inflation rate or forcing unemployment to rise to higher levels, risking a downturn.\n</span><span id=\"83\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to keep inflation in check and I believe them, but they\u2019re suggesting not a lot of work will be necessary,\u201d said former New York Fed President William Dudley.</span> He believes rates will need to rise <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3% or</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4%,</span> which could damage markets.\n<span id=\"84\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a lot less popular\u201d in that environment than the one the Fed was in during the past decade, said Mr. Dudley.\n</span><span id=\"85\" class=\"red\">Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. <span id=\"86\" class=\"red\">87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\nAppeared in the <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 16,</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'The Fed\u2019s Slow Pivot To Tackling Inflation.'</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>The Fed Missed Inflation.

guard by how the economy responded as it reopened last year.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Unemployment fell much more quickly than expected\u2014<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% last</span> month <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 5.9% in</span> June.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Wages ratcheted steadily higher as employers faced shortages of labor.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Inflation surged last spring, driven by brisk demand for goods and by shipping bottlenecks and shortages for intermediate goods such as semiconductors.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Fed officials attributed the surge to idiosyncratic increases in the prices of a handful of items tied to reopening the economy, which they thought would be short-lived.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Instead, price pressures broadened.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Few economists, inside or outside the Fed, imagined such a large surge in inflation when the new framework was adopted.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Yet Fed officials felt compelled to hold rates at zero and continue adding to their bond portfolio to adhere to their guidance laid down for reaching maximum employment.\n</span>\u201cThat guidance, in retrospect, does not look like it was ideal,\u201d said Mr. Rosengren.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Additionally, Mr. Powell and his colleagues were slow to revise their forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates after President Biden signed <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.9 trillion</span> fiscal stimulus bill into law in <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2021,</span> though a handful of economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, warned the spending could feed inflation.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">On the heels of <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $900 billion</span> measure former President Donald Trump approved at the end <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> that boost in retrospect should \u201chave set their antennas quivering more than it did,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman.\n</span>By late last summer, Mr. Powell began to pivot. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">In November he initiated a plan to reduce the Fed\u2019s monthly bond buying to zero over eight months, clearing the way to raise rates by mid-2022.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">But the labor market was tightening fast, and inflation pressures, rather than easing, broadened.</span> In December, Mr. Powell said the purchases would end by March, allowing rate rises to begin immediately after.\nFor the central bank, it was an uncharacteristic about-face. \u201cAs the data came in, they said, \u2018We were wrong.\u2019 <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">How often do you hear the Fed say that?\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n</span>Despite the quick shift, the policy response still had room to catch up, Mr. Kohn said. <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">As recently as December, Fed officials continued to signal they would tighten monetary policy much as they had in the past: with a mild path of rate increases over the next three years.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">They premised that on inflation falling <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%,</span> even though they expected growth and unemployment to run at levels that would apply upward pressure on inflation.\n</span>\u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t add up,\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell seemed to acknowledge as much at a news conference after the Fed\u2019s meeting last month.</span> He hinted at a faster path of rate increases and declined to rule out raising rates at consecutive policy meetings, which hasn\u2019t happened <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2006,</span> or by a half percentage point at once. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to say exactly how this is going to go,\u201d he said.\nThat marks an important break from rate-rise cycles that began <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004 and</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> and it could make the current cycle more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 1994.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">That year, after a prolonged period of low, stable rates, the Fed under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan raised <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rates 3 percentage</span> points in a one-year span.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">The unexpectedly rapid tightening hammered bond prices more than almost any other move in the postwar era.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt and Mexico devalued its peso, ravaging its economy.</span> <span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered rates modestly <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995 amid</span> fears the economy might slide into recession.\n</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Greenspan again prepared to raise rates <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> he incorporated the advice of Mr. Bernanke, an accomplished academic and then a Fed governor, who said that clearer guidance about the Fed\u2019s goals and intentions could lead to more effective policy.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">\u201cAmbiguity has its uses, but mostly in noncooperative games like poker,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told colleagues <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003,</span> according to transcripts of a Fed policy meeting that year.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">\u201cMonetary policy is a cooperative game.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">The whole point is to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">At their meeting next month, Fed officials will release new projections showing how much they expect to lift rates.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">Thus far, their goal has been to raise them to \u201cneutral,\u201d a level that neither spurs nor slows growth, which officials estimate is <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3% when</span> inflation is near the Fed\u2019<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% target</span>.</span> Unlike in recent years, and a departure from Mr. Bernanke\u2019s guidance, how fast they get there and whether they go higher remain open questions.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Officials are hoping inflation declines as supply problems ease and demand shifts from goods, where prices rose sharply last year, toward services, where inflation has been less extreme.\n</span>There\u2019s plenty that could go wrong. <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Inflation might stay high because of factors outside of the Fed\u2019s control, such as a Russian invasion of Ukraine that roils energy markets, or shipping delays made worse by pandemic-driven lockdowns in Asia.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">And even if prices of goods moderate this year as expected, increases in wages and rents could keep inflation elevated <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">into 2023.</span>\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell has for now declined to provide so-called forward guidance about the policy path because the inflation outlook is so uncertain.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The uncertainty over inflation and lack of Fed guidance is leading to greater volatility in bond markets.</span> Until last Thursday, officials played down the prospect of starting with a half-point rate increase or acting between regularly scheduled policy meetings.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">\u201cI prefer not to be deploying that kind of stuff if we can avoid it, and so far, I think we\u2019ve got a smooth response to the inflation surprise,\u201d said James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, in a Feb.<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7 interview</span>.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">After Thursday\u2019s report that inflation had climbed further to a 40-year high <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7.5%,</span> Mr. Bullard changed his message, telling Bloomberg News that he would favor a bolder, half-point increase or an inter-meeting rate increase in the coming months.\n</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">His remarks accelerated the largest one-day jump in two-year Treasury bond yields <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2009 and</span> led futures markets to bet on a half-point increase next month.\n</span>If Mr. Powell and his colleagues deliver such a move, they could be criticized for panicking. <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">If he opts for the smaller increase, he could be criticized for not taking inflation seriously enough.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">\u201cIdeally, the Fed would come out and exert control of the policy message,\u201d including by saying it will raise rates in a fashion that doesn\u2019t inflame fears of an emergency, said Brian Sack, who ran the New York Fed\u2019s markets desk <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 to</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 and</span> is now the director of economics at hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Market speculation that the Fed might raise rates in between meetings, which intensified after Mr. Bullard\u2019s remarks, fanned fears that policy isn\u2019t well positioned to restrain the economy and bring down inflation, analysts said.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Complicating its deliberations, the Fed has more than one way of tightening policy by shrinking its bondholdings, which have more than doubled <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $9 trillion</span> since <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">When the Fed shrank its holdings <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2017 and</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> it did so passively by allowing a certain amount of securities to mature without replacing them every month.</span> <span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">Some Fed officials, uncomfortable with having such a big presence in Treasurys, the world\u2019s most important financial market, believe high inflation calls for a faster retreat by actively selling assets to raise longer-term rates.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">Ms. George, the Kansas City Fed leader, and Mr. Rosengren advocate that more aggressive path.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials are cool to that, at least for now.</span> <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re adjusting policy substantially in other ways, introducing asset sales just complicates the path,\u201d said Mr. Sack.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of pouring fuel on the fire. The balance sheet is an instrument with still-uncertain effects, and you don\u2019t want to push it too hard.\u201d\n<span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">For now, that also appears to be the predominant view at the Fed.</span> Mr. Powell said last month he wants the program to run in the background. <span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">It would function more like the rhythm section in a band, allowing the Fed to move its benchmark rate up or down if it wants to adjust policy.\n</span>Looming over this is the reaction of the markets. Stocks, corporate bonds and real estate all reached historically high valuations in part on the assumption rates would remain very low for years. <span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Though household borrowing as a share of U.S. gross domestic product is well below levels reached during the housing boom of 2004-06, corporate debt is near a record high.\n</span><span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere are people who are living in a world in which an aggressive Fed tightening\u2014an increasing possibility here\u2014is not an outcome they can accept, so they\u2019re pretending it won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners.</span> \u201cThe places where that\u2019s very real\u2014cryptocurrency, tech-related companies in private equity\u2014could be in deep trouble.\u201d\n<span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">Once there\u2019s a sharp decline in one of those sectors, that could set off volatility in other corners of the market, he said.\n</span><span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">Share Your Thoughts\nIs the Fed doing the right things to handle inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.\n<span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">Mr. Rosengren said the prospect of a soft landing for the economy has diminished over the past six months because of more persistent supply shocks and workers winning higher wages to offset higher prices.\n</span><span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Rapidly raising rates to address the inflation problem increases the risks of a recession, he said.</span> <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you\u2019re raising rates rapidly, you don\u2019t have time to see how the rate increases you\u2019ve already done have slowed down the economy,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"81\" class=\"red\">One danger is that the Fed faces a bind where inflation only partially reverses its recent climb.</span> <span id=\"82\" class=\"red\">That would leave officials forced to choose between accepting a somewhat higher inflation rate or forcing unemployment to rise to higher levels, risking a downturn.\n</span><span id=\"83\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to keep inflation in check and I believe them, but they\u2019re suggesting not a lot of work will be necessary,\u201d said former New York Fed President William Dudley.</span> He believes rates will need to rise <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3% or</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4%,</span> which could damage markets.\n<span id=\"84\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a lot less popular\u201d in that environment than the one the Fed was in during the past decade, said Mr. Dudley.\n</span><span id=\"85\" class=\"red\">Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. <span id=\"86\"

Thanks to everyone who sent us feedback yesterday on the new \u201cIn the atmosphere\u201d section of the newsletter. It sounds like many readers appreciate the new section. \ud83d\ude0a But first:\n\nFrom \u2018Green Jesus\u2019 to \u2018radical pragmatist\u2019: Inside the evolution of Canada's environment minister\n\nWhen top environmental ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries met in Berlin in May, Steven Guilbeault was among them.\n\nBut for the first time in his long career, he was meeting with the ministers inside the summit, rather than protesting in the streets outside.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked me, \u2018Is it your first G-7 meeting?\u2019\u201d Guilbeault recalled in an interview with The <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202.</span></span> \u201cI said: 'Well, it depends how you look at it. I've protested a number of them, but it's my first one inside. So it's an adjustment for sure.'\u201d\n\nGuilbeault,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 52,</span> has served as Canada's minister of environment and climate change since October. Before entering the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he spent more than two decades as an environmental activist with eyebrow-raising tactics.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2001,</span> while working for Greenpeace, Guilbeault scaled Toronto's CN Tower and unfurled a banner that called Canada and President George W. Bush \u201cclimate killers.\u201d The act of civil disobedience was meant to put pressure on Canada and America to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It earned him the nickname \u201cGreen Jesus\u201d among both fans and critics in the country's oil-rich west.\n\nIn April, however, Guilbeault made a decision that might have horrified his younger self: He approved the controversial Bay du Nord offshore oil project, which involves drilling up <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1 billion</span> barrels off Canada's east coast. The decision came two days after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that warned the world must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to stave off a climate catastrophe.\n\n\u201cI obviously didn't come into politics to approve oil projects,\u201d Guilbeault told The <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202.</span></span> \u201cIf I was alone, making the decision for myself, it's not the decision I would have made. ... But I'm now the environment and climate change minister <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 38 million</span> people.\u201d\n\nThe <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202 sat</span> down with Guilbeault on Monday at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, where he is meeting with U.S. officials including White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Here are highlights from the conversation:\n\nThe case for climate pragmatism\n\nGuilbeault calls himself a \u201cradical pragmatist.\u201d <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">To him, the phrase reflects his pursuit of \u201cradical\u201d policies to green Canada's economy \u2014 but also his recognition of harsh realities that complicate his lofty climate ambitions.\n\n</span>\u201cThe ideas I promote are fairly radical,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proposing that we overhaul our energy systems, the way we move around, the way we build things, and the way we operate our plants and industries. But there is a part of me that understands it can't happen overnight.\u201d\n\nWhen giving the green light to the Bay du Nord project, Guilbeault set <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">forth 137 legally</span> binding conditions that the energy giant Equinor must comply with for the lifetime of the project. For the first time, the conditions include a requirement to reach net-zero emissions <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2050.</span>\n\n\u201cI never said that Bay du Nord was \u2018green oil\u2019 or \u2018sustainable oil,'\u201d Guilbeault said. \u201cBut factually speaking, to our knowledge, it will be the lowest-emitting project of its kind in the world.\u201d\n\nGuilbeault, who is an avid reader of scientific reports from the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, said both organizations recognize that continued oil production is consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris agreement: limiting global warming <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.5 degrees</span> Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.\n\n\u201cIn <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1.5</span>-scenario world <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2050,</span> we're producing <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 25 to</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 million</span> barrels a day \u2014 down <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 100 million</span>, where we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it's a significant decrease in production.

Thanks to everyone who sent us feedback yesterday on the new \u201cIn the atmosphere\u201d section of the newsletter. It sounds like many readers appreciate the new section. \ud83d\ude0a But first:\n\nFrom \u2018Green Jesus\u2019 to \u2018radical pragmatist\u2019: Inside the evolution of Canada's environment minister\n\nWhen top environmental ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries met in Berlin in May, Steven Guilbeault was among them.\n\nBut for the first time in his long career, he was meeting with the ministers inside the summit, rather than protesting in the streets outside.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked me, \u2018Is it your first G-7 meeting?\u2019\u201d Guilbeault recalled in an interview with The <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202.</span></span> \u201cI said: 'Well, it depends how you look at it. I've protested a number of them, but it's my first one inside. So it's an adjustment for sure.'\u201d\n\nGuilbeault,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 52,</span> has served as Canada's minister of environment and climate change since October. Before entering the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he spent more than two decades as an environmental activist with eyebrow-raising tactics.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2001,</span> while working for Greenpeace, Guilbeault scaled Toronto's CN Tower and unfurled a banner that called Canada and President George W. Bush \u201cclimate killers.\u201d The act of civil disobedience was meant to put pressure on Canada and America to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It earned him the nickname \u201cGreen Jesus\u201d among both fans and critics in the country's oil-rich west.\n\nIn April, however, Guilbeault made a decision that might have horrified his younger self: He approved the controversial Bay du Nord offshore oil project, which involves drilling up <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1 billion</span> barrels off Canada's east coast. The decision came two days after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that warned the world must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to stave off a climate catastrophe.\n\n\u201cI obviously didn't come into politics to approve oil projects,\u201d Guilbeault told The <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202.</span></span> \u201cIf I was alone, making the decision for myself, it's not the decision I would have made. ... But I'm now the environment and climate change minister <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 38 million</span> people.\u201d\n\nThe <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Climate 202 sat</span> down with Guilbeault on Monday at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, where he is meeting with U.S. officials including White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Here are highlights from the conversation:\n\nThe case for climate pragmatism\n\nGuilbeault calls himself a \u201cradical pragmatist.\u201d <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">To him, the phrase reflects his pursuit of \u201cradical\u201d policies to green Canada's economy \u2014 but also his recognition of harsh realities that complicate his lofty climate ambitions.\n\n</span>\u201cThe ideas I promote are fairly radical,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proposing that we overhaul our energy systems, the way we move around, the way we build things, and the way we operate our plants and industries. But there is a part of me that understands it can't happen overnight.\u201d\n\nWhen giving the green light to the Bay du Nord project, Guilbeault set <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">forth 137 legally</span> binding conditions that the energy giant Equinor must comply with for the lifetime of the project. For the first time, the conditions include a requirement to reach net-zero emissions <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2050.</span>\n\n\u201cI never said that Bay du Nord was \u2018green oil\u2019 or \u2018sustainable oil,'\u201d Guilbeault said. \u201cBut factually speaking, to our knowledge, it will be the lowest-emitting project of its kind in the world.\u201d\n\nGuilbeault, who is an avid reader of scientific reports from the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, said both organizations recognize that continued oil production is consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris agreement: limiting global warming <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.5 degrees</span> Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.\n\n\u201cIn <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1.5</span>-scenario world <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2050,</span> we're producing <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 25 to</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 million</span> barrels a day \u2014 down <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 100 million</span>, where we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it's a significant decrease in production. But there will still be oil consumed <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2050.</span> And therefore it should be the lowest-emitting oil possible.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, Guilbeault said he will probably press U.S. lawmakers this week on Democrats' plans to provide <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $12,500 tax</span> credit for people who buy electric vehicles made in America.\n\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Ottawa has argued that the proposal, which was included in Democrats' stalled budget reconciliation bill, could force General Motors and Ford to relocate major manufacturing facilities from Canada to the United States.</span> Guilbeault warned that it could also undermine cross-border collaboration on securing the critical minerals used in EV batteries, including nickel and cobalt.\n\n\u201cU.S. decision-makers will have to decide,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether they would rather have their nascent EV sector be dependent on critical minerals from Canada or from China.\u201d\n\nGuilbeault said the topic will probably come up when he meets with Sens.

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nRents <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 2.3% in</span> the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the smallest annual increase since the third quarter <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2010,</span> according to data from RealPage Inc. scheduled to be released on Wednesday. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Rental growth was flat in major cities with otherwise strong economies\u2014such as Austin, Portland, Seattle, Dallas and Washington, D.C.\u2014due to large amounts of new supply.\n\n</span>While average rents continued to grow, individual landlords cut rents in some markets. In addition, landlords are offering tenants incentives including as many as three months paying no rent, free parking, credit for ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, and Amazon gift cards for as much <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $2,500,</span> according to renters, real-estate brokers and Hotpads, a rental search platform.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Joshua Clark, an economist at Hotpads who was looking recently for an apartment in the Capitol Hill area in Seattle, saw <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $2,500 Amazon</span> gift card offer.\n\n</span>\u201cI had my mouth open for a second. Seriously a lot of my expenses would be covered for the year, which would be fantastic,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Landlords have enjoyed a <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 32 straight</span> quarters of annual rent growth on average, as the U.S. economy strengthened and millennials delayed homeownership.</span> But the reports of slowing, which began in a few markets in <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2016,</span> have intensified to the point that the balance is shifting towards renters and away from landlords.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Greg Willett, chief economist at RealPage, predicted average rents nationwide could flatten if current trends continue.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s kind of telling as we look at some of these individual markets that are losing momentum because they\u2019re important ones,\u201d Mr. Willett said.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The cause of the slowdown is primarily new supply.</span> Developers responded to escalating rents by building the most new apartments <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 30 years</span>, sending a flood of new high-end units to downtown areas across the country. Developers are expected to <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">add 300,000 new</span> units over the next year across the U.S., Mr. Willett said.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">At the same time as there are signs renter demand is starting to wane because millennials are marrying, having children and buying homes or moving into single-family rentals.</span> The U.S. <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">added 1.3 million</span> owner households in the first quarter over the same period last year and <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost 286,000 renter</span> households, according to U.S. Census data released in April.\n\nEarlier this year, Manuel Valdes,<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 33 years</span> old, and his wife got a surprise letter from his Seattle landlord offering to renew their lease -- <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $50 less</span> than they were paying.\n\nTheir rent had gone <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $300 in</span> the three years they had lived there. \u201cWe had been dreading another jump in rents,\u201d said Mr. Valdes, who is a journalist. His wife, Teresa Mosqueda, sits on the local city council. They now plan to use the extra money to save for a down payment for a house.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Landlords rely on the warm spring months to fill apartment buildings because renter demand trails off in the colder months of the years.</span> \u201cThe second quarter is when you get most of your rent growth for the year,\u201d Mr. Willett said.\n\nThe softening is taking place even in high growth cities. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">For example, the Dallas metropolitan area has the strongest job growth in the country.\n\n</span>But Dallas area rents were essentially flat in the second quarter, down <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 3.1% annual</span> rent growth in the second quarter last year and a recent high of more <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6% rent</span> growth in <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2015.</span> Landlords there are offering tenants as much as two months of free rent.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The problem in Dallas, landlords said, is simply too much supply.</span> Developers are building <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 22,000 apartments</span> right now, compared with a long-term average of less than half that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just too much inventory,\u201d said Ric Campo, chairman and chief executive of Camden Property Trust, one of the country\u2019s largest apartment owners. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn order to get those apartments absorbed, even with good strong job growth, it\u2019s taking the sizzle out of the market.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In Seattle, where Amazon has been an economic powerhouse and home-price growth has been the fastest in the country, landlords are also struggling to fill new units.\n\n</span>Rents grew <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 0.5% in</span> Seattle compared with a year earlier, down from annual rent growth <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5.6% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017 and</span> a recent high <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 8.6% rent</span> growth a year prior to that.\n\nMichael Chotzen, a Seattle property manager, said some buildings near him in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are slashing security deposits, requiring tenants to put down several hundred dollars or nothing at all. But that can be risky. \u201cIf a tenant trashes a unit there needs to be funds to cover that,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Data released Tuesday from another apartment data provider, Reis Inc. also showed a largely weak rental market across the country in the second quarter.</span> The national vacancy rate ticked up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.8% from</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.3% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The number of additional units that were rented fell to just <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 37,000 from</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 53,000 a</span> year earlier, suggesting demand was weaker.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Despite the recent slowdown, apartment owners note that the market is far from crashing and rent growth remains just below historic norms.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Little concern has arisen that the softening could have broader economic repercussions for the U.S. financial system.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Compared with the last real-estate crash, owners say there are unlikely to be many foreclosures because they are carrying much less debt.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Jay Hiemenz, president and chief operating officer of Phoenix-based Alliance Residential, an apartment company, said banks are only giving loans to developers for <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 65% of</span> the cost to build a project, compared <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 80% or</span> more previously.\n\n</span>\u201cAbsent some shock that none of us can see, we will have a softer landing,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "<h3>Looking for an Apartment?

quarter compared with a year earlier, the smallest annual increase since the third quarter <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2010,</span> according to data from RealPage Inc. scheduled to be released on Wednesday. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Rental growth was flat in major cities with otherwise strong economies\u2014such as Austin, Portland, Seattle, Dallas and Washington, D.C.\u2014due to large amounts of new supply.\n\n</span>While average rents continued to grow, individual landlords cut rents in some markets. In addition, landlords are offering tenants incentives including as many as three months paying no rent, free parking, credit for ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, and Amazon gift cards for as much <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $2,500,</span> according to renters, real-estate brokers and Hotpads, a rental search platform.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Joshua Clark, an economist at Hotpads who was looking recently for an apartment in the Capitol Hill area in Seattle, saw <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $2,500 Amazon</span> gift card offer.\n\n</span>\u201cI had my mouth open for a second. Seriously a lot of my expenses would be covered for the year, which would be fantastic,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Landlords have enjoyed a <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 32 straight</span> quarters of annual rent growth on average, as the U.S. economy strengthened and millennials delayed homeownership.</span> But the reports of slowing, which began in a few markets in <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2016,</span> have intensified to the point that the balance is shifting towards renters and away from landlords.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Greg Willett, chief economist at RealPage, predicted average rents nationwide could flatten if current trends continue.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s kind of telling as we look at some of these individual markets that are losing momentum because they\u2019re important ones,\u201d Mr. Willett said.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The cause of the slowdown is primarily new supply.</span> Developers responded to escalating rents by building the most new apartments <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 30 years</span>, sending a flood of new high-end units to downtown areas across the country. Developers are expected to <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">add 300,000 new</span> units over the next year across the U.S., Mr. Willett said.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">At the same time as there are signs renter demand is starting to wane because millennials are marrying, having children and buying homes or moving into single-family rentals.</span> The U.S. <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">added 1.3 million</span> owner households in the first quarter over the same period last year and <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost 286,000 renter</span> households, according to U.S. Census data released in April.\n\nEarlier this year, Manuel Valdes,<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 33 years</span> old, and his wife got a surprise letter from his Seattle landlord offering to renew their lease -- <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $50 less</span> than they were paying.\n\nTheir rent had gone <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $300 in</span> the three years they had lived there. \u201cWe had been dreading another jump in rents,\u201d said Mr. Valdes, who is a journalist. His wife, Teresa Mosqueda, sits on the local city council. They now plan to use the extra money to save for a down payment for a house.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Landlords rely on the warm spring months to fill apartment buildings because renter demand trails off in the colder months of the years.</span> \u201cThe second quarter is when you get most of your rent growth for the year,\u201d Mr. Willett said.\n\nThe softening is taking place even in high growth cities. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">For example, the Dallas metropolitan area has the strongest job growth in the country.\n\n</span>But Dallas area rents were essentially flat in the second quarter, down <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 3.1% annual</span> rent growth in the second quarter last year and a recent high of more <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6% rent</span> growth in <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2015.</span> Landlords there are offering tenants as much as two months of free rent.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The problem in Dallas, landlords said, is simply too much supply.</span> Developers are building <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 22,000 apartments</span> right now, compared with a long-term average of less than half that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just too much inventory,\u201d said Ric Campo, chairman and chief executive of Camden Property Trust, one of the country\u2019s largest apartment owners. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn order to get those apartments absorbed, even with good strong job growth, it\u2019s taking the sizzle out of the market.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In Seattle, where Amazon has been an economic powerhouse and home-price growth has been the fastest in the country, landlords are also struggling to fill new units.\n\n</span>Rents grew <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 0.5% in</span> Seattle compared with a year earlier, down from annual rent growth <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5.6% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017 and</span> a recent high <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 8.6% rent</span> growth a year prior to that.\n\nMichael Chotzen, a Seattle property manager, said some buildings near him in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are slashing security deposits, requiring tenants to put down several hundred dollars or nothing at all. But that can be risky. \u201cIf a tenant trashes a unit there needs to be funds to cover that,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Data released Tuesday from another apartment data provider, Reis Inc. also showed a largely weak rental market across the country in the second quarter.</span> The national vacancy rate ticked up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.8% from</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.3% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The number of additional units that were rented fell to just <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 37,000 from</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 53,000 a</span> year earlier, suggesting demand was weaker.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Despite the recent slowdown, apartment owners note that the market is far from crashing and rent growth remains just below historic norms.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Little concern has arisen that the softening could have broader economic repercussions for the U.S. financial system.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Compared with the last real-estate crash, owners say there are unlikely to be many foreclosures because they are carrying much less debt.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Jay Hiemenz, president and chief operating officer of Phoenix-based Alliance Residential, an apartment company, said banks are only giving loans to developers for <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 65% of</span> the cost to build a project, compared <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 80% or</span> more previously.\n\n</span>\u201cAbsent some shock that none of us can see, we will have a softer landing,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Laura Kusisto at

Once, it was the bureaucratic headquarters for a government pension fund. Now, it is an illegal home <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 450 people</span> who sleep in the old office rooms, share bathroom cleanup duties, and take turns standing guard at the front entrance, ready to press an alarm button if and when authorities show up and order them to leave.\nSome of the people in the building are newly arrived immigrants \u2014 the targets of a law-and-order clampdown by Italy\u2019s populist government.\nOthers, though, might have expected support from a government that has promised to put \u201cItalians first.\u201d\n\u201cI am an Italian,\u201d said Maurizio Zanga,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62,</span> a laid-off garbage collector who lives on the seventh floor next to a family of Somalis. \u201cBut I am not one of the first. I am one of the last.\u201d\nIf Italy\u2019s government offers a test case of what happens when populists come to power, the threat to clear illegally occupied buildings shows how defend-the-country measures can end up hurting citizens, too.\nInterior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 head of the far-right League party \u2014 has said all squatted buildings in Rome will be cleared, \u201cnone excluded.\u201d The Salvini decree, as his signature policy is known, is a sweeping security measure passed by the government in November and presented as a tool to push back against migration. It also raises penalties for squatters, no matter their nationality or legal status, who can face steeper fines and up to four years imprisonment.\nLast December, when authorities in Rome cleared a particularly ramshackle building, Salvini showed up at the site and streamed a four-hour video of the operation. He posted on Facebook that the squatters were \u201cmostly migrants.\u201d The video footage included an interview with a man who said he was from Gambia and would sleep on the street that night.\n\u201cSend them back to Africa,\u201d one poster wrote below.\n\u201cBravo, Matteo,\u201d another said.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But the prevalence of squatters in Rome speaks not only to a five-year influx of people coming from the Middle East and Africa, but also to a generation-long economic stagnation \u2014 and the failure of one government after the next to provide a safety net.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With a dearth of public housing, in a city plagued by economic misfortune and mismanagement, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 10,000 and</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,000 people</span> live as squatters in abandoned factories, office buildings and other properties, according to city data.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Fabrizio Nizi, a housing activist, estimates <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 30 to</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40 percent</span> of the squatters in Rome are Italians.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Some lost their jobs before retirement age and couldn\u2019t find new positions.</span> Others have struggled to enter the workforce entirely. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Some have applied for public housing, but the city faces a logjam, and new units are not being built.\n</span>\u201cPeople wait up <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 years</span> for a home,\u201d Nizi said. \u201cYou need to wait for somebody to die.\u201d\nRome has not taken an official stance on the squatters, but a city spokesman said that \u201cplenty of the squatted buildings put the safety of their own squatters at risk. The goal is that of offering a dignified alternative.\u201d\nSome of the buildings are in dire shape \u2014 no windows, trash everywhere. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The old pension building, though, more closely resembles a tidy low-income housing complex, albeit one with no heat.</span> The nameplates of old bureaucrats remain posted outside the office rooms. But some of the occupants have decorated their doors with stickers and art. Residents stage theater performances. Handwritten signs provide rules for a \u201ccivil coexistence.\u201d <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The complex is managed by the residents with help from Action, a housing activist group.\n</span>Experts say authorities are unlikely to forcibly clear all squatted buildings, as Salvini has promised. Still, Salvini has managed to raise the anxiety everywhere.\n\u201cDay and night, my children are suffering just thinking about it,\u201d said Gianfranco Meneghetti,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 53,</span></span> a resident on the seventh floor of the pension building.\nGianfranco was born in Ethiopia but is an Italian citizen. His eldest child, who <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 15,</span> sometimes asks what the family would do after eviction.\n\u201cThere is nothing I can say to reassure him,\u201d Meneghetti said.\nPension building residents said Salvini\u2019s threats have also heightened an us-versus-them mentality.

Once, it was the bureaucratic headquarters for a government pension fund. Now, it is an illegal home <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 450 people</span> who sleep in the old office rooms, share bathroom cleanup duties, and take turns standing guard at the front entrance, ready to press an alarm button if and when authorities show up and order them to leave.\nSome of the people in the building are newly arrived immigrants \u2014 the targets of a law-and-order clampdown by Italy\u2019s populist government.\nOthers, though, might have expected support from a government that has promised to put \u201cItalians first.\u201d\n\u201cI am an Italian,\u201d said Maurizio Zanga,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62,</span> a laid-off garbage collector who lives on the seventh floor next to a family of Somalis. \u201cBut I am not one of the first. I am one of the last.\u201d\nIf Italy\u2019s government offers a test case of what happens when populists come to power, the threat to clear illegally occupied buildings shows how defend-the-country measures can end up hurting citizens, too.\nInterior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 head of the far-right League party \u2014 has said all squatted buildings in Rome will be cleared, \u201cnone excluded.\u201d The Salvini decree, as his signature policy is known, is a sweeping security measure passed by the government in November and presented as a tool to push back against migration. It also raises penalties for squatters, no matter their nationality or legal status, who can face steeper fines and up to four years imprisonment.\nLast December, when authorities in Rome cleared a particularly ramshackle building, Salvini showed up at the site and streamed a four-hour video of the operation. He posted on Facebook that the squatters were \u201cmostly migrants.\u201d The video footage included an interview with a man who said he was from Gambia and would sleep on the street that night.\n\u201cSend them back to Africa,\u201d one poster wrote below.\n\u201cBravo, Matteo,\u201d another said.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But the prevalence of squatters in Rome speaks not only to a five-year influx of people coming from the Middle East and Africa, but also to a generation-long economic stagnation \u2014 and the failure of one government after the next to provide a safety net.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With a dearth of public housing, in a city plagued by economic misfortune and mismanagement, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 10,000 and</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,000 people</span> live as squatters in abandoned factories, office buildings and other properties, according to city data.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Fabrizio Nizi, a housing activist, estimates <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 30 to</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40 percent</span> of the squatters in Rome are Italians.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Some lost their jobs before retirement age and couldn\u2019t find new positions.</span> Others have struggled to enter the workforce entirely. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Some have applied for public housing, but the city faces a logjam, and new units are not being built.\n</span>\u201cPeople wait up <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 years</span> for a home,\u201d Nizi said. \u201cYou need to wait for somebody to die.\u201d\nRome has not taken an official stance on the squatters, but a city spokesman said that \u201cplenty of the squatted buildings put the safety of their own squatters at risk. The goal is that of offering a dignified alternative.\u201d\nSome of the buildings are in dire shape \u2014 no windows, trash everywhere. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The old pension building, though, more closely resembles a tidy low-income housing complex, albeit one with no heat.</span> The nameplates of old bureaucrats remain posted outside the office rooms. But some of the occupants have decorated their doors with stickers and art. Residents stage theater performances. Handwritten signs provide rules for a \u201ccivil coexistence.\u201d <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The complex is managed by the residents with help from Action, a housing activist group.\n</span>Experts say authorities are unlikely to forcibly clear all squatted buildings, as Salvini has promised.

A border wall was Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise\u2014and his progress in building one figures to be an issue in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 presidential</span> race.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s invitation, issued on New Year\u2019s Day, went to the top eight Republican and Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate.\n\nThe meeting, if it takes place, is expected to include a briefing on border security from the Department of Homeland Security, a congressional aide said.\n\nAides to Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), said late Tuesday afternoon that planned to attend.\n\nOutgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.)\u2014whose last official day in power is Wednesday\u2014won\u2019t attend. Incoming House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California plans to go, as does incoming GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), aides said. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also plans to attend the meeting.\n\nIn recent tweets, Mr. Trump has sought to coax Democrats to the negotiating table, while portraying their opposition to wall funding as an irresponsible acceptance of what he called \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorder Security and the Wall \u2018thing\u2019 and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal?\u201d\n\nRecent attempts to reach a breakthrough and reopen the government have gone nowhere.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally, had lunch with the president at the White House on Sunday and laid out a plan that would couple border wall spending with new protections for undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d who were brought to the U.S. when they were young. The plan was aimed at picking up Democratic votes. Though Mr. Graham said that the president voiced openness toward the proposal, congressional Democratic officials expressed skepticism that something as complex as the status of Dreamers could be resolved in the current round of talks.\n\nMeantime, House Democrats say they plan to push to reopen the government when they take control of the chamber on Thursday with a package of six spending bills that would fund most of the government through September. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">They will also put forward a separate bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span> without the border wall money that Mr. Trump seeks to put in that agency\u2019s budget.\n\n</span>Democrats say that would allow the government to reopen quickly, while still leaving the door open for a debate on the wall. They also note Senate Republicans backed just such a package last month, a deal that was rejected by Mr. Trump and Republicans in the House.\n\n\u201cIt would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,\u201d Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Pelosi said in a joint statement earlier this week.\n\nBut the president balked at the idea, tweeting, \u201cThe Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security\u2014and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders, in a statement late Tuesday night, said the Democrats\u2019 plan is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.

A border wall was Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise\u2014and his progress in building one figures to be an issue in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 presidential</span> race.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s invitation, issued on New Year\u2019s Day, went to the top eight Republican and Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate.\n\nThe meeting, if it takes place, is expected to include a briefing on border security from the Department of Homeland Security, a congressional aide said.\n\nAides to Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), said late Tuesday afternoon that planned to attend.\n\nOutgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.)\u2014whose last official day in power is Wednesday\u2014won\u2019t attend. Incoming House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California plans to go, as does incoming GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), aides said. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also plans to attend the meeting.\n\nIn recent tweets, Mr. Trump has sought to coax Democrats to the negotiating table, while portraying their opposition to wall funding as an irresponsible acceptance of what he called \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorder Security and the Wall \u2018thing\u2019 and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal?\u201d\n\nRecent attempts to reach a breakthrough and reopen the government have gone nowhere.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally, had lunch with the president at the White House on Sunday and laid out a plan that would couple border wall spending with new protections for undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d who were brought to the U.S. when they were young. The plan was aimed at picking up Democratic votes. Though Mr. Graham said that the president voiced openness toward the proposal, congressional Democratic officials expressed skepticism that something as complex as the status of Dreamers could be resolved in the current round of talks.\n\nMeantime, House Democrats say they plan to push to reopen the government when they take control of the chamber on Thursday with a package of six spending bills that would fund most of the government through September. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">They will also put forward a separate bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span> without the border wall money that Mr. Trump seeks to put in that agency\u2019s budget.\n\n</span>Democrats say that would allow the government to reopen quickly, while still leaving the door open for a debate on the wall. They also note Senate Republicans backed just such a package last month, a deal that was rejected by Mr. Trump and Republicans in the House.\n\n\u201cIt would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,\u201d Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Pelosi said in a joint statement earlier this week.\n\nBut the president balked at the idea, tweeting, \u201cThe Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security\u2014and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders, in a statement late Tuesday night, said the Democrats\u2019 plan is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.

But <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30% of</span></span> Ocado\u2019s fresh produce is wasted daily, a drag on margins and far worse than a traditional grocer\u2019s average <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 3%,</span> the firm found.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">An Ocado spokeswoman dismissed the Barclays estimate, saying spoilage amounts <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.7% of</span> annual sales and that the company is an industry leader in reducing food waste.\n\n</span>Still, delivery is one of the fastest-growing segments of an otherwise sluggish supermarket sector. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Online sales of consumables grew <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 21% in</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> according to the Willard Bishop grocery consulting firm.\n\n</span>The planned partnership between Amazon and Whole Foods is a new challenge for delivery services vying for that growth, said Bill Bishop, co-founder of Brick Meets Click, an e-commerce grocery consulting firm. Whole Foods\u2019<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 466 stores</span> could serve as mini-distribution centers in densely populated, affluent areas. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Amazon, which has demonstrated a willingness to forgo profits for years to build up market share, could use its e-commerce prowess to cut the specialty grocer\u2019s prices to near those of its competitors.\n\n</span>\u201cThis gives them another way to drive up penetration in grocery purchasing and ultimately delivery,\u201d Mr. Bishop said.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Peapod executives say that being owned by a large retailer like Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize allows the delivery service to bargain with suppliers for lower prices.</span> They add that Peapod is profitable in markets where it has operated for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe are the original online grocers and have outlasted many of the competitors who have come and gone,\u201d said Jennifer Carr-Smith, chief executive of the Skokie, Ill.,-based company, which was founded <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989 and</span> took its first orders by fax.\n\nFreshDirect didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Brick-and-mortar supermarkets are wrestling with whether to invest in their own delivery services, cede profits to startups or risk losing more business to Amazon.</span> For grocers who use Amazon Prime to deliver to their customers, the Whole Foods deal presents a particular challenge.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Natural health-food chain Sprouts Farmers Markets Inc. will continue to use Prime to deliver groceries for now, said Bradley Lukow, chief financial officer for the Phoenix-based company.</span> \u201cWe\u2019ll make the determination going forward if we want to make any changes,\u201d he said at an industry conference last week.\n\nSchnuck chief marketing officer Andrew Nadin said the grocery chain was planning to expand its partnership with Instacart even before Amazon set out to buy Whole Foods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never tried to out-Wal-Mart Wal-Mart. We won\u2019t try to out-Amazon Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\nInstacart, founded by a former Amazon engineer, aims to be able to deliver <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 80% of</span> U.S. households next year, up <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 69% today</span>. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In addition to stores like Wegmans Food Market Inc. and Target Corp., Instacart currently handles deliveries for Whole Foods.</span> Analysts expect that to end.\n\nInstacart wouldn\u2019t comment on its partnership with Whole Foods.\n\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cAmazon is here,\u201d said Nilam Ganenthiran, Instacart\u2019s chief business officer.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cGrocery retail is going to have to respond.\u201d\n\nLaura Stevens contributed to this article.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Corrections & Amplifications <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 0.7% in</span> annual sales of Ocado Group PLC\u2019s product is wasted.</span> An earlier version of this article cited data from a Barclays Capital Inc. report that incorrectly said <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30% of</span></span> Ocado\u2019s fresh produce is wasted daily.

Whole Foods\u2019<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 466 stores</span> could serve as mini-distribution centers in densely populated, affluent areas. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Amazon, which has demonstrated a willingness to forgo profits for years to build up market share, could use its e-commerce prowess to cut the specialty grocer\u2019s prices to near those of its competitors.\n\n</span>\u201cThis gives them another way to drive up penetration in grocery purchasing and ultimately delivery,\u201d Mr. Bishop said.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Peapod executives say that being owned by a large retailer like Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize allows the delivery service to bargain with suppliers for lower prices.</span> They add that Peapod is profitable in markets where it has operated for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe are the original online grocers and have outlasted many of the competitors who have come and gone,\u201d said Jennifer Carr-Smith, chief executive of the Skokie, Ill.,-based company, which was founded <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989 and</span> took its first orders by fax.\n\nFreshDirect didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Brick-and-mortar supermarkets are wrestling with whether to invest in their own delivery services, cede profits to startups or risk losing more business to Amazon.</span> For grocers who use Amazon Prime to deliver to their customers, the Whole Foods deal presents a particular challenge.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Natural health-food chain Sprouts Farmers Markets Inc. will continue to use Prime to deliver groceries for now, said Bradley Lukow, chief financial officer for the Phoenix-based company.</span> \u201cWe\u2019ll make the determination going forward if we want to make any changes,\u201d he said at an industry conference last week.\n\nSchnuck chief marketing officer Andrew Nadin said the grocery chain was planning to expand its partnership with Instacart even before Amazon set out to buy Whole Foods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never tried to out-Wal-Mart Wal-Mart.

Depending on the findings, the study could offer a defense of the cartel and the Saudi role in it.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The research project doesn\u2019t reflect an active debate inside the government over whether to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the near term, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Senior Saudi officials see the study as a high priority economic-policy inquiry, according to these people.</span> Mr. Sieminski said he ordered the study, and that the analysis isn\u2019t unusual and explores topics his researchers normally delve into.\n\nThe report is part of a wider rethinking among senior government officials in Saudi Arabia about OPEC, according to the people familiar with the matter. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Officials are grappling with the assumption\u2014shared increasingly in the oil industry\u2014that oil demand will one day peak, the senior Saudi adviser said.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">In this context, the study is seen among senior officials as an exercise in gaming out how markets might react if demand falls so much that OPEC loses sway and disbands, the adviser said.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For decades, Saudi Arabia and its fellow members have insisted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is a crucial global economic institution\u2014a forum by which big producers can mete out oil production to keep prices from getting too low or too high.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Critics have accused OPEC of manipulating oil prices at the expense of big oil-consuming economies such as the U.S., and Mr. Trump has been outspoken in his condemnation.</span> A group of U.S. lawmakers has pushed legislation that would effectively label OPEC an illegal cartel.\n\nThe proposed legislation, dubbed NOPEC, has withered during several U.S. administrations. Backers have said they think it might fare better under Mr. Trump.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe kingdom knows demand for oil won\u2019t last forever...so you need to think past OPEC,\u201d the senior adviser said.</span> \u201cYou also have a NOPEC act being considered\u201d in Washington.\n\nWhile there is no debate in the Saudi government about disbanding OPEC soon, senior government officials have recently started to question the longer-term rationale for the cartel because of the clout that Saudi Arabia and Russia alone can have on markets, according to another senior Saudi adviser.\n\nThose questions have grown as Russia has worked more closely with Saudi Arabia in recent years. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Russia and a group of allied oil producers joined OPEC in a deal about two years ago to rein in oil production amid superlow prices.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The combined group\u2019s leverage over global production succeeded in lifting prices\u2014so much so that the group more recently agreed to open the taps again to cool them off.</span> The two sides are slated to meet again this weekend in Abu Dhabi.\n\nDespite the impact on global markets, the closer coordination has upset some OPEC members, who have complained they are being sidelined by decision makers in Riyadh and Moscow.\n\nSpokesmen for the Saudi government and energy ministry didn\u2019t answer requests for comment.\n\nThe think tank, Riyadh-based King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, or Kapsarc, bills itself as an independent research institution. Its staff advises dominant Saudi agencies such as Saudi Aramco and the Saudi energy ministry.\n\nMr. Sieminski said the study was building on previous research that looked at the role of OPEC\u2019s spare capacity in stabilizing oil markets. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The earlier work concluded that the absence of such a cushion \u201cwould lead to a more volatile price environment and be negative for the global economy,\u201d he said.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The research project comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has broad control running the kingdom, has pushed in several directions to reshape his country\u2019s economy, society and its wider role in the world.</span> Prince Mohammed pushed an initial public offering of a slice of Saudi Aramco, the country\u2019s state owned oil company\u2014an effort that people familiar with the matter say has since stalled.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The IPO plan was a pillar in what the crown prince has called a bigger plan to modernize the Saudi economy.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He has pushed big investments in global technology and finance, while the country has tried hard to lure foreign investors into the kingdom.\n\n</span>Those plans have been complicated after Turkey reported the killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and later said Saudi officials \u201cat the highest levels\u201d were behind it. Saudi Arabia has claimed rogue elements killed Mr. Khashoggi, without the knowledge of the crown prince.\n\nThe OPEC study aims to \u201cassess the short/medium-term consequences of a dissolution of OPEC,\u201d according to an overview reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is intended to determine how the global oil market, and Saudi finances, would look \u201cif coordination between oil producing countries disappear,\u201d according to the overview.\n\n</span>The overview describes two scenarios to investigate, if OPEC isn\u2019t in the picture:<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">All big oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, act competitively\u2014fighting each other for market share;<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2.</span> Saudi Arabia, instead, attempts to leverage its massive oil output alone to help balance global supply and demand in an attempt to keep oil prices steady\u2014similar to the role that members say OPEC plays today.\n\n</span>Two prominent Saudi government advisers, both central to the formation of the kingdom\u2019s oil policy, are scheduled to meet researchers on the project weekly, according to the overview.

Depending on the findings, the study could offer a defense of the cartel and the Saudi role in it.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The research project doesn\u2019t reflect an active debate inside the government over whether to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the near term, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Senior Saudi officials see the study as a high priority economic-policy inquiry, according to these people.</span> Mr. Sieminski said he ordered the study, and that the analysis isn\u2019t unusual and explores topics his researchers normally delve into.\n\nThe report is part of a wider rethinking among senior government officials in Saudi Arabia about OPEC, according to the people familiar with the matter. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Officials are grappling with the assumption\u2014shared increasingly in the oil industry\u2014that oil demand will one day peak, the senior Saudi adviser said.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">In this context, the study is seen among senior officials as an exercise in gaming out how markets might react if demand falls so much that OPEC loses sway and disbands, the adviser said.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For decades, Saudi Arabia and its fellow members have insisted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is a crucial global economic institution\u2014a forum by which big producers can mete out oil production to keep prices from getting too low or too high.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Critics have accused OPEC of manipulating oil prices at the expense of big oil-consuming economies such as the U.S., and Mr. Trump has been outspoken in his condemnation.</span> A group of U.S. lawmakers has pushed legislation that would effectively label OPEC an illegal cartel.\n\nThe proposed legislation, dubbed NOPEC, has withered during several U.S. administrations. Backers have said they think it might fare better under Mr. Trump.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe kingdom knows demand for oil won\u2019t last forever...so you need to think past OPEC,\u201d the senior adviser said.</span> \u201cYou also have a NOPEC act being considered\u201d in Washington.\n\nWhile there is no debate in the Saudi government about disbanding OPEC soon, senior government officials have recently started to question the longer-term rationale for the cartel because of the clout that Saudi Arabia and Russia alone can have on markets, according to another senior Saudi adviser.\n\nThose questions have grown as Russia has worked more closely with Saudi Arabia in recent years. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Russia and a group of allied oil producers joined OPEC in a deal about two years ago to rein in oil production amid superlow prices.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The combined group\u2019s leverage over global production succeeded in lifting prices\u2014so much so that the group more recently agreed to open the taps again to cool them off.</span> The two sides are slated to meet again this weekend in Abu Dhabi.\n\nDespite the impact on global markets, the closer coordination has upset some OPEC members, who have complained they are being sidelined by decision makers in Riyadh and Moscow.\n\nSpokesmen for the Saudi government and energy ministry didn\u2019t answer requests for comment.\n\nThe think tank, Riyadh-based King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, or Kapsarc, bills itself as an independent research institution. Its staff advises dominant Saudi agencies such as Saudi Aramco and the Saudi energy ministry.\n\nMr. Sieminski said the study was building on previous research that looked at the role of OPEC\u2019s spare capacity in stabilizing oil markets. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The earlier work concluded that the absence of such a cushion \u201cwould lead to a more volatile price environment and be negative for the global economy,\u201d he said.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The research project comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has broad control running the kingdom, has pushed in several directions to reshape his country\u2019s economy, society and its wider role in the world.</span> Prince Mohammed pushed an initial public offering of a slice of Saudi Aramco, the country\u2019s state owned oil company\u2014an effort that people familiar with the matter say has since stalled.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The IPO plan was a pillar in what the crown prince has called a bigger plan to modernize the Saudi economy.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He has pushed big investments in global technology and finance, while the country has tried hard to lure foreign investors into the kingdom.\n\n</span>Those plans have been complicated after Turkey reported the killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and later said Saudi officials \u201cat the highest levels\u201d were behind it. Saudi Arabia has claimed rogue elements killed Mr. Khashoggi, without the knowledge of the crown prince.\n\nThe OPEC study aims to \u201cassess the short/medium-term consequences of a dissolution of OPEC,\u201d according to an overview reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is intended to determine how the global oil market, and Saudi finances, would look \u201cif coordination between oil producing countries disappear,\u201d according to the overview.\n\n</span>The overview describes two scenarios to investigate, if OPEC isn\u2019t in the picture:<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">All big oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, act competitively\u2014fighting each other for market share;<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2.</span> Saudi Arabia, instead, attempts to leverage its massive oil output alone to help balance global supply and demand in an attempt to keep oil prices steady\u2014similar to the role that members say OPEC plays today.\n\n</span>Two prominent Saudi government advisers, both central to the formation of the kingdom\u2019s oil policy, are scheduled to meet researchers on the project weekly, according to the overview. Mr. Sieminski said contacts with the Saudi energy ministry were to provide data for the study.\n\nThe study comes at a time of particularly acute tensions inside OPEC, a fractious group on the best of days.

Authoritarians Spot An Opportunity.</h3>At first glance, Venezuela looks like one of the world\u2019s biggest coronavirus success stories. Amid rampant worries in the pandemic\u2019s earliest stages that COVID-19 would overwhelm the crisis-stricken state, socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro locked down the country and seemingly stopped the spread. As of Monday, Venezuelan authorities had reported just more <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20,000 cases</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 174 deaths</span>, among the lowest numbers in Latin America \u2015 a region the virus has hit harder than any other.\nFor months, though, there have been abundant signs that the situation is actually very dire. Doctors have reported that case numbers are far higher than the government asserts and that the country\u2019s beleaguered health system is on the brink of collapse. Journalists have reported their own, higher figures, or shown up outside hospitals to observe the situation for themselves.\nMaduro has reacted with a crackdown against anyone who may expose the state\u2019s faults. In imprisoning doctors and journalists, he joins a roster of authoritarian leaders who have sought to cover up their own inadequacies and failing responses to the pandemic through censorship and repression.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want anybody giving alternative numbers. They want to keep control of the message,\u201d said Phil Gunson, a Venezuela-based researcher at the International Crisis Group, an NGO. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t really been a comprehensive response [in Venezuela] \u2015 all we\u2019ve had is propaganda.\u201d\nGlobally, the world\u2019s most authoritarian governments, in Venezuela and Nicaragua, Egypt, China and elsewhere, have treated the pandemic similarly: By using it as cover to broaden and intensify their efforts to clamp down on dissent and thwart the free spread of information \u2014 and not just about the pandemic.\nFor authoritarian governments, the coronavirus outbreak has provided an opening to target some of the last remaining freedoms in their countries, and in Maduro\u2019s case, it has sapped an opposition seeking to oust him of any remaining momentum it had. In other nations, meanwhile, the virus has presented an opportunity for aspiring authoritarians to act on their most autocratic whims.\nThat approach isn\u2019t just a threat to democratic norms and human rights \u2015 it has likely also further obscured the true scope of the global pandemic and made it harder for health experts to adequately respond to it.\n\u201cThe countries that are taking these measures are making it difficult to effectively control the epidemic,\u201d said Domingos Alves, a professor of social medicine at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. \u201cAnd they may, from now on, be the effective cause of a worsening of this epidemic in other countries in the coming months.\u201d\nSilencing Reporters And Doctors\nDuring a mid-May campaign stop, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that the public health problem wasn\u2019t the coronavirus itself, but that testing was finding too many cases of it.\n\u201cWhen you test, you have a case,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn\u2019t do any testing we would have very few cases.\u201d\nHe was roundly mocked for the absurdity of the statement, but a lack of testing has proved a key way for governments to limit the collection of coronavirus data.\nVenezuela, which was credited for its aggressive early response to the virus, has closed all but two official testing sites and prevented private labs from conducting their own exams.\nIn Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega largely denied the existence of the virus, civil society organizations have suggested that the country\u2019s relatively low counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths are due to a lack of testing and the government\u2019s deliberate attempts to obscure data: \u201cThere are reasons to believe\u201d the official estimates are \u201cfar lower than the actual number\u201d of infections and deaths, said Tiziano Breda, a Guatemala-based Central America analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIn the pandemic\u2019s earliest stages, China\u2019s efforts to control its data \u2015 which included the suppression of medical experts and a crackdown on reporting \u2015 robbed international health organizations and governments of valuable information and time they could have used to prepare for outbreaks. Whistleblower Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, died of COVID-19 months after authorities silenced his warnings. And social media discussion of the virus is censored in China, where the government has expelled foreign journalists exposing the dark reality of the crisis.\nThose repressive practices have spread alongside the virus. Venezuelan authorities arrested a journalist for reporting alternative coronavirus figures in March, just days after confirming the country\u2019s first case. The Committee to Protect Journalists has said at <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 10 reporters</span> were arrested in the country between late March and early May.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist ... and you\u2019re in the vicinity of a hospital and you look like you\u2019re reporting, you risk getting picked up and held and your material taken, and you may get roughed up,\u201d Gunson said. \u201cYou may get a call in the middle of the night from the secret police and get disappeared for a few days, and then charged with offenses under what\u2019s called the law against hate.\u201d\nCambodia jailed a journalist simply for quoting the prime minister, while Thailand has criminalized reporting that authorities deem to be \u201cfalse\u201d news about coronavirus. Police in India have arrested and harassed members of the press who have written critical stories, and the government has reportedly pressured media outlets to publish positive stories about its coronavirus response. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">In Zimbabwe, journalists have gone into hiding to avoid reprisal from the government: \u201cI am hiding like a rat in my own country for doing nothing more than my job,\u201d one Zimbabwean reporter told The Associated Press this week.\n</span>There is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training. Amr Magdi, Human Rights Watch expert on the Middle East and North Africa\nMedical workers have also become an increasingly prominent target of authoritarians: In June, Egyptian authorities arrested Alaa Shaaban Hamida, a pregnant 26-year-old doctor, at her office and charged her with terrorism offenses and \u201cspreading false news\u201d after a nurse used Hamida\u2019s phone to report a coronavirus case directly to the Health Ministry instead of telling her managers. At least a dozen other health care workers and journalists have been held on draconian charges.\nThe Egyptian government has failed to provide protective equipment and shares questionable information about the scale of the crisis, and rights groups say the country\u2019s outbreak is almost certainly worse than official figures suggest. But President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly have publicly criticized physicians for not containing the virus, and when the country\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 organization planned a press conference to object to the accusations, rights groups say security forces seized the organization\u2019s headquarters to silence them.\n\u201cThere is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training,\u201d said Amr Magdi, a Middle East and North Africa expert at Human Rights Watch.\nIn Russia, infectious disease experts have faced intimidation after questioning whether the government is manipulating statistics and death tolls. And while Venezuelan doctors questioned the Maduro government\u2019s official data early in the summer, health officials now \u201care very, very careful not to give alternative numbers,\u201d Gunson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been made absolutely clear to them,\u201d Gunson said, \u201cthat they will be treated very severely.\u201d\nMedical professionals in Nicaragua have repeatedly pushed back against Ortega\u2019s handling of the pandemic: In a May letter, more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 700 doctors</span> warned that \u201cthe deliberate concealment and manipulation of the actual number of people affected\u201d had prevented Nicaragua from implementing \u201cappropriate epidemiological measures of containment and mitigation.\u201d\nOrtega\u2019s government has also faced criticism from human rights groups that have accused his government of purposefully obscuring the number of COVID-19 cases by classifying deaths as a result of pneumonia or other common respiratory illnesses, and for holding \u201cexpress burials\u201d in the middle of the night.\nAs of last week, at <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 21 Nicaraguan</span> doctors had been fired for disputing the government\u2019s official line on the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe targeting of reporters and doctors is part of broader human rights crackdowns: Turkey\u2019s government reportedly arrested hundreds of people over social media posts, offering only vague explanations for their offenses, while it also detained numerous journalists for reporting on the virus. Zimbabwean human rights groups said the government arrested more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> after a protest this weekend. And between the end of March and early June, the Venezuelan nonprofit Center for Justice and Peace documented at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 184 </span>\u201csystematic human rights violations\u201d under Maduro.\nThe Rise Of New Authoritarians\nIn many of these countries, the attacks on dissent and the limiting of official data are continuations of long-standing practices: The Venezuelan government hasn\u2019t published epidemiological data for the last five years, Gunson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a black hole in terms of official statistics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re just suppressing information about COVID-19. They are across the board suppressing information.\u201d\nOrtega\u2019s government in Nicaragua has for years limited access to official figures on homicides and other vital public information, and his actions during the pandemic are almost indistinguishable from the sort of repression that drew international attention in <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2018,</span> when mass protests broke out against his government in Managua, the capital city.\n\u201cThe repression, the crackdowns and the threats against journalists have been basically constant since the outbreak of the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2018 crisis</span>,\u201d Breda said. \u201cThe topic now has shifted: We\u2019re talking less about civil liberties and the right to protest, or the narrowing of the democratic state. Now it\u2019s all centered around information related to COVID-19. So the topic is a shift, but the practice has remained the same.\u201d\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Trump has sought to bring down Maduro and, to a lesser extent, Ortega, since the beginning of his presidency, and has implemented brutal economic sanctions against both governments that he has refused to relax during the pandemic, further complicating both nations\u2019 approach to the virus.</span> The pandemic, however, has given a new model of authoritarians \u2015 including Trump himself and far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro \u2015 the opportunity to act on their most autocratic and conspiratorial desires, and they have adopted many of the same practices as Ortega and Maduro, two men they ostensibly oppose.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and Brazil rank first and second, respectively, on the list of largest coronavirus outbreaks, but a lack of reliable testing \u2015 and their presidents\u2019 lack of interest in facilitating it \u2015 has likely obscured the true scope of the pandemic in both nations.\n</span>Alves, of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, authored a study in April that showed Brazil\u2019s outbreak was likely at <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 times</span> larger than official figures showed, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the actual number of infections in the U.S. is likely anywhere from six <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 times</span> the confirmed total.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Trump and Bolsonaro have both dismissed rising death counts, politicized the use of masks and falsely framed efforts to control the virus\u2019 spread as motivated attempts to crater their economies and bring down their governments.\n</span>Bolsonaro and Trump have each faced accusations of trying to block the public from accessing coronavirus-related data on government websites. They have both used the pandemic to undermine faith in the press and democratic institutions. And the two right-wing leaders, who are friendly with each other, have targeted top public health experts for offering dissenting views, either by firing them, driving them to quit or essentially sidelining them.\nTrump has responded to his declining popularity with an authoritarian response to racial justice protests, while Bolsonaro has tried to expand his influence over Brazil\u2019s impartial institutions, including its law enforcement and judicial bodies. Before he tested positive in early July, Bolsonaro appeared at small, weekly protests where some supporters called on him to close Brazil\u2019s national Congress.\nOther leaders have gone even farther than Trump and Bolsonaro. Hungary, for example, passed measures that allowed far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban to effectively rule by decree for months, a time he used to undercut opposition parties.\nIn Bolivia, far-right evangelical leader Jeanine A\u00f1ez, who took control after an effective coup against former socialist President Evo Morales, has used the outbreak to strengthen her grip on power, which was cemented with rampant human rights abuses. Bolivia\u2019s electoral court twice delayed presidential elections early in the pandemic, allowing A\u00f1ez, a supposedly temporary leader who is running despite promising not to, to remain in power even longer. In late July, the country\u2019s top electoral court pushed the presidential vote back again, raising concerns about the future of a democracy that has been on the brink for months.\nUnder A\u00f1ez, who is trailing in election polls, \u201cstate-sponsored violence, restrictions on free speech, and arbitrary detentions have all contributed to a climate of fear and misinformation that has undermined the rule of law as well as the prospects of fair and open elections,\u201d a Harvard Law School report released last week said.\nEcuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno, meanwhile, decried criticism of his government\u2019s slow response to the pandemic as \u201cfake news,\u201d even as The New York Times reported that the country\u2019s death toll was <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 15 times</span> higher than the government\u2019s official figures suggested. In July, a major Ecuadorian opposition party led by former President Rafael Correa was suspended from <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2021 elections</span> in a move prominent regional leaders called an \u201cact of political bias\u201d that \u201ccalls into question the legitimacy\u201d of the upcoming contests. (A court recently reinstated the party.)\nAnd in Guatemala, President Alejandro Giammattei, who human rights activists feared would cement the country\u2019s turn away from democracy when he won election last year, has taken advantage of pandemic-era lockdowns to further weaken the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\nGiammattei, a doctor and former police officer, initially responded with strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a curfew. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">But in recent weeks, it has become \u201creally obvious that the curfew is a way of controlling social unrest,\u201d especially as rising poverty rates and anger over government corruption threaten to bring Guatemalans back into the streets, said Frank La Rue, a Guatemalan human rights expert and the president of the Central American Institute for the Study of Social Democracy.\n</span>The majority coalition in Guatemalan Congress, which includes Giammattei\u2019s party, has also attempted to undermine the country\u2019s supreme and constitutional courts during the pandemic as it continues to roll back efforts to combat institutionalized corruption in a country where major parties have long been linked to organized crime.\n\u201cGuatemala is a tragedy moving from bad to worse,\u201d La Rue said of his native country, although his warning seemingly applies to countless other nations across the globe.\n\u201cThe pandemic,\u201d he added, \u201chas been the perfect cover to take a more authoritarian approach to things.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Many Countries See The Pandemic As A Crisis.

They want to keep control of the message,\u201d said Phil Gunson, a Venezuela-based researcher at the International Crisis Group, an NGO. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t really been a comprehensive response [in Venezuela] \u2015 all we\u2019ve had is propaganda.\u201d\nGlobally, the world\u2019s most authoritarian governments, in Venezuela and Nicaragua, Egypt, China and elsewhere, have treated the pandemic similarly: By using it as cover to broaden and intensify their efforts to clamp down on dissent and thwart the free spread of information \u2014 and not just about the pandemic.\nFor authoritarian governments, the coronavirus outbreak has provided an opening to target some of the last remaining freedoms in their countries, and in Maduro\u2019s case, it has sapped an opposition seeking to oust him of any remaining momentum it had. In other nations, meanwhile, the virus has presented an opportunity for aspiring authoritarians to act on their most autocratic whims.\nThat approach isn\u2019t just a threat to democratic norms and human rights \u2015 it has likely also further obscured the true scope of the global pandemic and made it harder for health experts to adequately respond to it.\n\u201cThe countries that are taking these measures are making it difficult to effectively control the epidemic,\u201d said Domingos Alves, a professor of social medicine at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. \u201cAnd they may, from now on, be the effective cause of a worsening of this epidemic in other countries in the coming months.\u201d\nSilencing Reporters And Doctors\nDuring a mid-May campaign stop, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that the public health problem wasn\u2019t the coronavirus itself, but that testing was finding too many cases of it.\n\u201cWhen you test, you have a case,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn\u2019t do any testing we would have very few cases.\u201d\nHe was roundly mocked for the absurdity of the statement, but a lack of testing has proved a key way for governments to limit the collection of coronavirus data.\nVenezuela, which was credited for its aggressive early response to the virus, has closed all but two official testing sites and prevented private labs from conducting their own exams.\nIn Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega largely denied the existence of the virus, civil society organizations have suggested that the country\u2019s relatively low counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths are due to a lack of testing and the government\u2019s deliberate attempts to obscure data: \u201cThere are reasons to believe\u201d the official estimates are \u201cfar lower than the actual number\u201d of infections and deaths, said Tiziano Breda, a Guatemala-based Central America analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIn the pandemic\u2019s earliest stages, China\u2019s efforts to control its data \u2015 which included the suppression of medical experts and a crackdown on reporting \u2015 robbed international health organizations and governments of valuable information and time they could have used to prepare for outbreaks. Whistleblower Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, died of COVID-19 months after authorities silenced his warnings. And social media discussion of the virus is censored in China, where the government has expelled foreign journalists exposing the dark reality of the crisis.\nThose repressive practices have spread alongside the virus. Venezuelan authorities arrested a journalist for reporting alternative coronavirus figures in March, just days after confirming the country\u2019s first case. The Committee to Protect Journalists has said at <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 10 reporters</span> were arrested in the country between late March and early May.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist ... and you\u2019re in the vicinity of a hospital and you look like you\u2019re reporting, you risk getting picked up and held and your material taken, and you may get roughed up,\u201d Gunson said. \u201cYou may get a call in the middle of the night from the secret police and get disappeared for a few days, and then charged with offenses under what\u2019s called the law against hate.\u201d\nCambodia jailed a journalist simply for quoting the prime minister, while Thailand has criminalized reporting that authorities deem to be \u201cfalse\u201d news about coronavirus. Police in India have arrested and harassed members of the press who have written critical stories, and the government has reportedly pressured media outlets to publish positive stories about its coronavirus response. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">In Zimbabwe, journalists have gone into hiding to avoid reprisal from the government: \u201cI am hiding like a rat in my own country for doing nothing more than my job,\u201d one Zimbabwean reporter told The Associated Press this week.\n</span>There is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training. Amr Magdi, Human Rights Watch expert on the Middle East and North Africa\nMedical workers have also become an increasingly prominent target of authoritarians: In June, Egyptian authorities arrested Alaa Shaaban Hamida, a pregnant 26-year-old doctor, at her office and charged her with terrorism offenses and \u201cspreading false news\u201d after a nurse used Hamida\u2019s phone to report a coronavirus case directly to the Health Ministry instead of telling her managers. At least a dozen other health care workers and journalists have been held on draconian charges.\nThe Egyptian government has failed to provide protective equipment and shares questionable information about the scale of the crisis, and rights groups say the country\u2019s outbreak is almost certainly worse than official figures suggest. But President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly have publicly criticized physicians for not containing the virus, and when the country\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 organization planned a press conference to object to the accusations, rights groups say security forces seized the organization\u2019s headquarters to silence them.\n\u201cThere is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training,\u201d said Amr Magdi, a Middle East and North Africa expert at Human Rights Watch.\nIn Russia, infectious disease experts have faced intimidation after questioning whether the government is manipulating statistics and death tolls. And while Venezuelan doctors questioned the Maduro government\u2019s official data early in the summer, health officials now \u201care very, very careful not to give alternative numbers,\u201d Gunson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been made absolutely clear to them,\u201d Gunson said, \u201cthat they will be treated very severely.\u201d\nMedical professionals in Nicaragua have repeatedly pushed back against Ortega\u2019s handling of the pandemic: In a May letter, more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 700 doctors</span> warned that \u201cthe deliberate concealment and manipulation of the actual number of people affected\u201d had prevented Nicaragua from implementing \u201cappropriate epidemiological measures of containment and mitigation.\u201d\nOrtega\u2019s government has also faced criticism from human rights groups that have accused his government of purposefully obscuring the number of COVID-19 cases by classifying deaths as a result of pneumonia or other common respiratory illnesses, and for holding \u201cexpress burials\u201d in the middle of the night.\nAs of last week, at <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 21 Nicaraguan</span> doctors had been fired for disputing the government\u2019s official line on the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe targeting of reporters and doctors is part of broader human rights crackdowns: Turkey\u2019s government reportedly arrested hundreds of people over social media posts, offering only vague explanations for their offenses, while it also detained numerous journalists for reporting on the virus. Zimbabwean human rights groups said the government arrested more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> after a protest this weekend. And between the end of March and early June, the Venezuelan nonprofit Center for Justice and Peace documented at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 184 </span>\u201csystematic human rights violations\u201d under Maduro.\nThe Rise Of New Authoritarians\nIn many of these countries, the attacks on dissent and the limiting of official data are continuations of long-standing practices: The Venezuelan government hasn\u2019t published epidemiological data for the last five years, Gunson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a black hole in terms of official statistics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re just suppressing information about COVID-19. They are across the board suppressing information.\u201d\nOrtega\u2019s government in Nicaragua has for years limited access to official figures on homicides and other vital public information, and his actions during the pandemic are almost indistinguishable from the sort of repression that drew international attention in <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2018,</span> when mass protests broke out against his government in Managua, the capital city.\n\u201cThe repression, the crackdowns and the threats against journalists have been basically constant since the outbreak of the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2018 crisis</span>,\u201d Breda said. \u201cThe topic now has shifted: We\u2019re talking less about civil liberties and the right to protest, or the narrowing of the democratic state. Now it\u2019s all centered around information related to COVID-19. So the topic is a shift, but the practice has remained the same.\u201d\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Trump has sought to bring down Maduro and, to a lesser extent, Ortega, since the beginning of his presidency, and has implemented brutal economic sanctions against both governments that he has refused to relax during the pandemic, further complicating both nations\u2019 approach to the virus.</span> The pandemic, however, has given a new model of authoritarians \u2015 including Trump himself and far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro \u2015 the opportunity to act on their most autocratic and conspiratorial desires, and they have adopted many of the same practices as Ortega and Maduro, two men they ostensibly oppose.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and Brazil rank first and second, respectively, on the list of largest coronavirus outbreaks, but a lack of reliable testing \u2015 and their presidents\u2019 lack of interest in facilitating it \u2015 has likely obscured the true scope of the pandemic in both nations.\n</span>Alves, of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, authored a study in April that showed Brazil\u2019s outbreak was likely at <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 times</span> larger than official figures showed, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the actual number of infections in the U.S. is likely anywhere from six <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 times</span> the confirmed total.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Trump and Bolsonaro have both dismissed rising death counts, politicized the use of masks and falsely framed efforts to control the virus\u2019 spread as motivated attempts to crater their economies and bring down their governments.\n</span>Bolsonaro and Trump have each faced accusations of trying to block the public from accessing coronavirus-related data on government websites. They have both used the pandemic to undermine faith in the press and democratic institutions. And the two right-wing leaders, who are friendly with each other, have targeted top public health experts for offering dissenting views, either by firing them, driving them to quit or essentially sidelining them.\nTrump has responded to his declining popularity with an authoritarian response to racial justice protests, while Bolsonaro has tried to expand his influence over Brazil\u2019s impartial institutions, including its law enforcement and judicial bodies. Before he tested positive in early July, Bolsonaro appeared at small, weekly protests where some supporters called on him to close Brazil\u2019s national Congress.\nOther leaders have gone even farther than Trump and Bolsonaro. Hungary, for example, passed measures that allowed far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban to effectively rule by decree for months, a time he used to undercut opposition parties.\nIn Bolivia, far-right evangelical leader Jeanine A\u00f1ez, who took control after an effective coup against former socialist President Evo Morales, has used the outbreak to strengthen her grip on power, which was cemented with rampant human rights abuses. Bolivia\u2019s electoral court twice delayed presidential elections early in the pandemic, allowing A\u00f1ez, a supposedly temporary leader who is running despite promising not to, to remain in power even longer. In late July, the country\u2019s top electoral court pushed the presidential vote back again, raising concerns about the future of a democracy that has been on the brink for months.\nUnder A\u00f1ez, who is trailing in election polls, \u201cstate-sponsored violence, restrictions on free speech, and arbitrary detentions have all contributed to a climate of fear and misinformation that has undermined the rule of law as well as the prospects of fair and open elections,\u201d a Harvard Law School report released last week said.\nEcuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno, meanwhile, decried criticism of his government\u2019s slow response to the pandemic as \u201cfake news,\u201d even as The New York Times reported that the country\u2019s death toll was <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 15 times</span> higher than the government\u2019s official figures suggested. In July, a major Ecuadorian opposition party led by former President Rafael Correa was suspended from <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2021 elections</span> in a move prominent regional leaders called an \u201cact of political bias\u201d that \u201ccalls into question the legitimacy\u201d of the upcoming contests. (A court recently reinstated the party.)\nAnd in Guatemala, President Alejandro Giammattei, who human rights activists feared would cement the country\u2019s turn away from democracy when he won election last year, has taken advantage of pandemic-era lockdowns to further weaken the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\nGiammattei, a doctor and former police officer, initially responded with strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a curfew. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">But in recent weeks, it has become \u201creally obvious that the curfew is a way of controlling social unrest,\u201d especially as rising poverty rates and anger over government corruption threaten to bring Guatemalans back into the streets, said Frank La Rue, a Guatemalan human rights expert and the president of the Central American Institute for the Study of Social Democracy.\n</span>The majority coalition in Guatemalan Congress, which includes Giammattei\u2019s party, has also attempted to undermine the country\u2019s supreme and constitutional courts during the pandemic as it continues to roll back efforts to combat institutionalized corruption in a country where major parties have long been linked to organized crime.\n\u201cGuatemala is a tragedy moving from bad to worse,\u201d La Rue said of his native country, although his warning seemingly applies to countless other nations across the globe.\n\u201cThe pandemic,\u201d he added, \u201chas been the perfect cover to take a more authoritarian approach to things.\u201d"}, "28952": {"id": "28952", "text": "<h3>Betsy Wade, First Woman to Edit News at The Times, Dies at 91</h3>Advertisement\nSupported by\nBetsy Wade, First Woman to Edit News at The Times, Dies <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 91\nIn</span> a 45-year Times career, she also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York and fought a sex discrimination case against the paper.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Betsy Wade, the first woman to edit news copy for The New York Times and the lead plaintiff in a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper on behalf of its female employees, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</span> She <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 91.</span>\nHer death was confirmed by her husband, James Boylan, who said she had learned <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 that</span> she had colon cancer.\nIn a 45-year Times career, Ms. Wade also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York, the largest local in the national journalism union (now known as the NewsGuild).\nShe was revered among peers for her role in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1974 class</span>-action suit against The Times, one of the industry\u2019s earliest fights over women\u2019s rights to equal treatment in hiring, promotion, pay and workplace protections under federal anti-discrimination laws.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Four years after being fired as a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune for being pregnant, Ms. Wade landed at The Times on Oct.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1956,</span></span> and instantly broke a 105-year-old practice of male copy editing in the news department, where women were rare, relatively underpaid and relegated largely to reporting on fashions, cooking and other \u201cwomen\u2019s news,\u201d or to clerical or secretarial jobs.\n</span>\u201cThe copy desk did not put a screen around me,\u201d Ms. Wade told Nan Robertson for her book \u201cThe Girls in the Balcony\u201d (1992), about the rise of women at The Times. \u201cBut they took the cuspidors out of the city room the first week.

But the newspaper\u2019s house organ, Times Talk, proclaimed her promotion with a sexist idiom: \u201cBetsy\u2019s in the slot: first dame to make it.\u201d\nA year earlier she had been entrusted to help prepare the Pentagon Papers, classified documents and explanatory articles that told of American duplicity in Vietnam, for publication. In a historic ruling for freedom of the press, the Supreme Court denied a Nixon administration challenge. The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for publishing the papers.\nShe joined a women\u2019s caucus <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972 to</span> study gender issues at The Times. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">It found that weekly salaries for women <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $59 less</span> than those of men with comparable jobs; that there were no women in top corporate or masthead ranks, on the editorial board or <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 22 national</span> correspondents; and that the staffs <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 33 foreign</span> correspondents <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 35 Washington</span> bureau members included only three women each.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1978,</span></span> after a four-year court fight, The Times and representatives <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 560 women</span> on <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 6,000</span>-member staff settled a class-action suit \u2014 titled Elizabeth Boylan, et al, v. The New York Times, using Ms. Wade\u2019s married name (she went by Betsy Wade professionally) \u2014 on terms approved by Judge Henry Werker. Both sides claimed victory.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Times agreed to place more women in jobs ranging from entry level to top management, and to create annuities covering costs of \u201cdelayed career advancement or denied opportunity.\u201d</span> But it did not grant raises or admit any violations of law. James C. Goodale, The Times\u2019s executive vice president at the time, called the paper\u2019s voluntary affirmative action program \u201cone of the strongest in the country.\u201d\nMs. Wade countered: \u201cIf Judge Werker is now able to say that The Times has progressed in affirmative action, it is our suit that compelled this. The paper began to move toward our goals when the suit went to court, and the women who have been hired since are aware of this.\u201d\nElizabeth Wade was born in Manhattan on <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1929,</span> to Sidney and Elizabeth (Manning) Wade.
