{"id": "18738", "displayed_text": "<h3>Anatomy of a \u2018smear\u2019: How John Bolton became a target of the pro-Trump Internet</h3>The story quickly gained more <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 5,000 interactions</span> on Facebook \u2014 meaning shares, likes or other user actions \u2014 as it spread across pages and groups devoted to defending Trump. Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The attacks, which unfolded vividly in <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 24 hours</span> after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases \u2014 such as \u201cBook Deal Bolton\u201d \u2014 gained currency across the far-right firmament.</span> By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.\nThe vilification of Bolton \u2014 branding him as a traitor and member of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him \u2014 made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president\u2019s impeachment trial as a \u201cdisgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a \u201cRejected Neocon\u201d and the \u201cDeep State\u2019s Last Desperate Act.\u201d\n</span>That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories \u2014 which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency \u2014 remain fundamental to his hold on his base.\n\u201cIt only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of \u201cAmerican Conspiracy Theories.\u201d The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, \u201chitting back fairly strongly with a smear that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.\u201d\nThe path traveled by the \u201cDisobedient Media\u201d entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles.</span> The name of his blog, he said, was based on a \u201cjoke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.\u201d\nThe sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups \u2014 with a collective membership of more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 300,000.</span> One of them was a group called \u201cFox News Sean Hannity,\u201d described as a forum for \u201call Sean Hannity fans.\u201d The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group \u2014 which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host \u2014 for what they would hear when they tuned in that night.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton\u2019s boosters, either.\n</span>\u201cNow the Republicans don\u2019t like Bolton, so they\u2019ll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Democrats weren\u2019t getting something useful out of him, they wouldn\u2019t be fans either.\u201d\nEfforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, \u201cTurned his \u2018drug deal\u2019 into a book deal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Bolton\u2019s description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia.\nThe blogger, Craig Weide, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 16,000 followers</span>, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 74,000 within</span> about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called \u201cFOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,\u201d an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network.\nThe idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee\u2019s rapid response team. \u201cHow convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,\u201d wrote Steve Guest, the RNC\u2019s rapid-response director. \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\nJason Miller, a spokesman for Trump\u2019<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2016 campaign</span> and co-host of Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room: Impeachment\u201d podcast, took to Twitter first thing Monday morning to brand the former national security adviser \u201cBook Deal Bolton.\u201d The nickname spread widely on social media during the day, amplified by pro-Trump influencers with tens of thousands of followers.\nA joint statement from Bolton, along with his publisher and literary agency, denied any coordination with the media.\nConservative pundits were unconvinced, repackaging Twitter talking points for their prime-time audiences. The epithet \u201cBook Deal Bolton\u201d appeared on screen Monday night on Fox News behind Hannity.\n\u201cGood for John,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cHe can sell all the books he wants.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But few went further than Dobbs, the hard-line Fox Business host and Trump whisperer who announced Monday night that Bolton had been \u201creduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state.\u201d\n</span>The accusation of being a \u201ctool for the radical Dems\u201d has been leveled widely on social media in recent months, applied to individuals as disparate as Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos. What they have in common is rebutting the president\u2019s claims.\nUsing the same guilt-by-association logic supporting the blog entry in \u201cDisobedient Media,\u201d Dobbs claimed that major donors to Bolton\u2019s super PAC were \u201cnever Trumpers.\u201d\n\u201cDo you see the pattern here with Mr. Bolton?\u201d Dobbs said, not stating the pattern but relying on his viewers to put together the pieces of the conspiratorial puzzle.\nThe notion that Bolton, a longtime bugbear of Democrats who has worked in four Republican administrations, was operating furtively within the White House to advance liberal objectives bemused some who have dealt with him. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous, and if it wasn\u2019t so serious, it\u2019d be humorous,\u201d said Chuck Hagel, the former defense secretary and Republican senator from Nebraska.\n\u201cIt shows you once again that there\u2019s very little honesty, decency or civility in Trump and the crowd around him,\u201d added Hagel, who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Bolton\u2019s nomination as U.N. ambassador foundered, leading to a recess appointment by President George W. Bush. \u201cI had my differences with him, but I would say that John Bolton is anything but \u2018deep state.\u2019 \u201d\nBolton\u2019s lawyer, Charles Cooper, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Of the effort to cast Bolton as a disgruntled government holdover, a former aide, Fred Fleitz, said, \u201cHe is an honorable man who had some significant achievements with President Trump in the National Security Council.\u201d Fleitz on Monday published an op-ed urging the former White House official to postpone publication of his book until after the election. But he distanced himself from the more strident criticism, saying in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve never called John Bolton part of the deep state.\u201d\nWhile lacking in evidence, the assertions made by Dobbs rested on a reliable scaffold of misleading claims bolted into place on Twitter over the course of the day.\nAn account that goes by the name Philip Schuyler \u2014 a Revolutionary-era general who went on to become a senator from New York \u2014 and describes itself simply as a \u201cSupporter of President Trump\u201d pointed implausibly to the \u201cdeep state.\u201d\n\u201cThough a Republican, Bolton would\u2019ve fit nicely into Obama\u2019s ultra conceited deep state,\u201d the user wrote Monday morning. By noon, the conservative columnist Todd Starnes, a former Fox News Radio host, was claiming without evidence or explanation that, \u201cThese Bolton allegations smell like Deep State swamp gas.\u201d\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "label_annotations": {"frame-macro": {"No": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the US economy": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the US economy": "4"}, "frame": {"Industry-specific": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}
