Now, she's taking her vision to the masses in a collaboration with H&M\n\nAug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 12</span>:52 pm ET\n\n\"BOHEMIAN.\" The word comes up when discussing the French designer Isabel Marant. She grudgingly accepts the inescapable. \"I hate to be put in a box,\" she says. \"It's difficult to accept, but it's not a bad tag. I'm bohemian in spirit.\"\n\nAlthough it accurately describes Marant's iconoclastic, freewheeling approach to life, as well as many of her enormously popular creations, from lace minidresses to fringe boots, it minimizes the scope of Marant's designs and her puritanical work ethic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Her attitude toward the business of fashion, however, is distinctly laissez-faire.\n\n</span>\"I never dreamed of being a big designer,\" Marant,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 46,</span> says. \"I don't care about being known all over the world.\"\n\nDespite her ambivalence, she has become a runaway fashion success story, born on the back of her trademark look, which can be described as equal parts rock 'n' roll, California surfer girl and insouciant Parisienne. Her line caters to those who aspire to passions beyond clothes but have the means to buy\u2014and buy a lot. <span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">Since the inception of her namesake label <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> sales have increased at a <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady 30 percent</span> each year\u2014even during the economic downturn\u2014allowing her to prosper as an independent label in an era of behemoths like LVMH, Prada Group and Kering.</span> There <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 13 of</span> her sparely designed Isabel Marant boutiques in countries from South Korea to Lebanon, and both of her lines (there is also a diffusion label, Isabel Marant \u00c9toile) are carried <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 800 retailers</span> worldwide. This November, she will join the ranks of Stella McCartney, Versace, Lanvin and Karl Lagerfeld as the next designer to collaborate with global mass retailer H&M, where she will also debut a men's collection.\n\nIt's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. \"I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,\" she says. \"It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nToday,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> \"We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. \"They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.\"\n\nMarant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. \"I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,\" she says. \"It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.\"\n\nON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with \"Mister Freedom\" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.\n\n\"I always wear my own clothes,\" she says. \"My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe.\" She laughs and adds, \"I get a good discount. She's very nice to me.\" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. \"I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?\"\n\n\"It's about the women surrounding me,\" she continues. \"I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse\u2014that's a fantasy.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe\u2014and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: \"You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing her instincts has generally served Marant well. \"Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,\" she says. \"It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so.\" She continues, \"During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare\u2014when it happens your heart is beating.\" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)\n\nShe begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. \"This takes time,\" she says. \"Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less.\" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. \"I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],\" she says. \"It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.\"\n\nIn person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. \"I think sometimes I should dye it,\" she says. \"And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' \" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.\n\nHer low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. \"I'm not this goddess of fashion\u2014I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,\" she says. \"I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.\"\n\nHer eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean \u00e9migr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Everybody is linked,\" Marant says of her large family. \"I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.\"\n\nTheir differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. \"My mother is quite German,\" she says, \"Very bio-ecologique\u2014very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.\"\n\nMarant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. \"They became my family,\" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. \"They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life.

I never have to justify myself to J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.\"\n\nMarant is quite content to have those conversations with herself.

What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. \"I had a kind of sadness,\" she says. \"I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.\"\n\nTomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: \"I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,\" she says. \"I love cooking\u2014all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans.\" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: \"If you have a nice house outside of Paris,\" she explains, \"you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nShe is still seeking to find that balance in her business\u2014although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> \"I don't want to be on every corner.

I don't want to overflow the world with Isabel Marant.\"\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "The French fashion designer's brand of effortless chic is practically a uniform for off-duty models and movie stars in the know. Now, she's taking her vision to the masses in a collaboration with H&M\n\nAug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 12</span>:52 pm ET\n\n\"BOHEMIAN.\" The word comes up when discussing the French designer Isabel Marant. She grudgingly accepts the inescapable. \"I hate to be put in a box,\" she says. \"It's difficult to accept, but it's not a bad tag. I'm bohemian in spirit.\"\n\nAlthough it accurately describes Marant's iconoclastic, freewheeling approach to life, as well as many of her enormously popular creations, from lace minidresses to fringe boots, it minimizes the scope of Marant's designs and her puritanical work ethic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Her attitude toward the business of fashion, however, is distinctly laissez-faire.\n\n</span>\"I never dreamed of being a big designer,\" Marant,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 46,</span> says. \"I don't care about being known all over the world.\"\n\nDespite her ambivalence, she has become a runaway fashion success story, born on the back of her trademark look, which can be described as equal parts rock 'n' roll, California surfer girl and insouciant Parisienne. Her line caters to those who aspire to passions beyond clothes but have the means to buy\u2014and buy a lot. <span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">Since the inception of her namesake label <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> sales have increased at a <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady 30 percent</span> each year\u2014even during the economic downturn\u2014allowing her to prosper as an independent label in an era of behemoths like LVMH, Prada Group and Kering.</span> There <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 13 of</span> her sparely designed Isabel Marant boutiques in countries from South Korea to Lebanon, and both of her lines (there is also a diffusion label, Isabel Marant \u00c9toile) are carried <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 800 retailers</span> worldwide. This November, she will join the ranks of Stella McCartney, Versace, Lanvin and Karl Lagerfeld as the next designer to collaborate with global mass retailer H&M, where she will also debut a men's collection.\n\nIt's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. \"I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,\" she says. \"It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nToday,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> \"We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. \"They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.\"\n\nMarant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. \"I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,\" she says. \"It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.\"\n\nON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with \"Mister Freedom\" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.\n\n\"I always wear my own clothes,\" she says. \"My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe.\" She laughs and adds, \"I get a good discount. She's very nice to me.\" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. \"I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?\"\n\n\"It's about the women surrounding me,\" she continues. \"I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse\u2014that's a fantasy.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe\u2014and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: \"You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing her instincts has generally served Marant well. \"Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,\" she says. \"It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so.\" She continues, \"During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare\u2014when it happens your heart is beating.\" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)\n\nShe begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. \"This takes time,\" she says. \"Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less.\" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. \"I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],\" she says. \"It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.\"\n\nIn person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. \"I think sometimes I should dye it,\" she says. \"And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' \" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.\n\nHer low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. \"I'm not this goddess of fashion\u2014I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,\" she says. \"I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.\"\n\nHer eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean \u00e9migr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Everybody is linked,\" Marant says of her large family. \"I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.\"\n\nTheir differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. \"My mother is quite German,\" she says, \"Very bio-ecologique\u2014very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.\"\n\nMarant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. \"They became my family,\" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. \"They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit.\" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)\n\nAs a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself.

Dozens of other relatives \u2014 aunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.\nAnd just weeks after Alan\u2019s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.\n\u201cWe die together, or we live together and make a future,\u201d her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.\nAlan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria\u2019s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.\nSo when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.\nInterviews <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.\nSince Alan\u2019s death, at <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.\nAlan\u2019s father, Abdullah, who <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat.

Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.\nKurdish Roots\nAlan\u2019s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.\n</span>They had six children.

When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan\u2019s death a force for change.\nBut before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp \u2014 all places soon to be shattered by violence.\nDriven From Damascus\nThe ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.\nAs the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan\u2019s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family\u2019s Damascus barbershop.\nSome of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, \u201cI participated.\u201d\nThe government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.\n\u201cAfter the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,\u201d Abdullah recalled. \u201cAny simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.\u201d\nOne day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis\u2019 in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.\nNext, Alan\u2019s cousin Shergo,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.\nGovernment artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus \u2014 where an armed insurgency was taking shape \u2014 from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.\nThe Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan\u2019s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.\nThose two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.\nThe flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy\u2019s leg.\nAt the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.\n\u201cSo I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave,\u2019\u201d Shergo\u2019s mother, Ghousoun recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s better than if they take us.\u201d\nKobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Life on the Run\nAt first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun\u2019s family in her cowshed.\nBack in Kobani, the Kurdi clan\u2019s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.\nMany of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.\nA Way Station in Turkey\nAbdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, \u201clike a chain on my hands.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.\n</span>\u201cThey sat in the house all day,\u201d he said, choking with tears. \u201cThe only thing they were waiting for was me.\u201d\nOther Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.\nThe promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan\u2019s aunt Fatima <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.\nHivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016.</span>\nOptions dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.\nIn June, Mohammad took a smugglers\u2019 boat to Greece and made it to Germany.\nAlan\u2019s cousin Yasser,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler\u2019s boat out of Turkey.\nDisasters at Sea\nHivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.\n</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.\nOn the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.\nHivrun\u2019s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.\nSoon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. \u201cWe had decided to go to paradise,\u201d Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe \u2014 or the hereafter.\nHours after Alan\u2019s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, \u201cJust keep his head above water!\u201d But all three drowned, one by one.\nOther survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, \u201cI\u2019m with you; don\u2019t worry,\u201d just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.\nIn the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers\u2019 practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.\nAbdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because \u201csomeone had to.\u201d\nRegardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.\nLittle Solace\nWithin hours, Alan\u2019s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.\nFrom her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada\u2019s red tape and the world\u2019s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.\n\u201cThose kids were born when the war was on,\u201d she recalled telling Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees. \u201cAnd they die with the war still on.\u201d\nHer raw message helped spur Western countries \u2014 briefly, at least \u2014 to open their doors to Syrians.\nBut none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.\nIn the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.\n\u201cThe most important thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to be together.\u201d\nFor the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.\nIn Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat \u2014 \u201ca horror film!\u201d one said \u2014 but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.\nTheir father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.\nTo the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.\nHe misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am!\u201d\nGhousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads \u201cKurdi.\u201d\n</span>\u201cPeople always need a haircut,\u201d she said.\nA Father\u2019s Heartache\nA few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters\u2019 phone numbers, even his dentures.\n\u201cI have become a shadow,\u201d Abdullah said.\nAfter he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.\nBarely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.\nBut he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: \u201cWhere was all this when my children were alive?\u201d\nHe called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family\u2019s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons\u2019 favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.\n\u201cI want something,\u201d he said, \u201cwith their smell.\u201d", "displayed_text": "ISTANBUL \u2014 When Alan Kurdi\u2019s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria\u2019s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.\nAs a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan\u2019s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.\nAn aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat.

(Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun\u2019s family in her cowshed.\nBack in Kobani, the Kurdi clan\u2019s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.\nMany of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.\nA Way Station in Turkey\nAbdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, \u201clike a chain on my hands.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.\n</span>\u201cThey sat in the house all day,\u201d he said, choking with tears. \u201cThe only thing they were waiting for was me.\u201d\nOther Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.\nThe promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan\u2019s aunt Fatima <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.\nHivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016.</span>\nOptions dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.\nIn June, Mohammad took a smugglers\u2019 boat to Greece and made it to Germany.\nAlan\u2019s cousin Yasser,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler\u2019s boat out of Turkey.\nDisasters at Sea\nHivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.\n</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.\nOn the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.\nHivrun\u2019s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.\nSoon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. \u201cWe had decided to go to paradise,\u201d Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe \u2014 or the hereafter.\nHours after Alan\u2019s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, \u201cJust keep his head above water!\u201d But all three drowned, one by one.\nOther survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, \u201cI\u2019m with you; don\u2019t worry,\u201d just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.\nIn the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers\u2019 practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.\nAbdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because \u201csomeone had to.\u201d\nRegardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.\nLittle Solace\nWithin hours, Alan\u2019s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.\nFrom her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada\u2019s red tape and the world\u2019s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.\n\u201cThose kids were born when the war was on,\u201d she recalled telling Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees. \u201cAnd they die with the war still on.\u201d\nHer raw message helped spur Western countries \u2014 briefly, at least \u2014 to open their doors to Syrians.\nBut none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.\nIn the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.\n\u201cThe most important thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to be together.\u201d\nFor the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.\nIn Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat \u2014 \u201ca horror film!\u201d one said \u2014 but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.\nTheir father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.\nTo the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.\nHe misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am!\u201d\nGhousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads \u201cKurdi.\u201d\n</span>\u201cPeople always need a haircut,\u201d she said.\nA Father\u2019s Heartache\nA few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters\u2019 phone numbers, even his dentures.\n\u201cI have become a shadow,\u201d Abdullah said.\nAfter he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.\nBarely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.\nBut he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: \u201cWhere was all this when my children were alive?\u201d\nHe called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family\u2019s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons\u2019 favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.\n\u201cI want something,\u201d he said, \u201cwith their smell.\u201d"}, "32615": {"id": "32615", "text": "Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2017 study</span> that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top. Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study\u2019s co-author told The Times.\n\u201cFifty thousand in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nAt the end of the Obama administration there were at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 10,000 troops</span> in Afghanistan.

The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 14 days</span> before the onset of illness,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71 percent</span> of those who tested positive <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 74 percent</span> of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistorically Black colleges and universities, I got them funded, they were on a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business.\u201d\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is exaggerated.\nMr. Trump is taking outsized credit. Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools have received recently. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The president <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">requested $643.9 million</span> in funding for H.B.C.U.\u2019s in <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2019 fiscal</span> year <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $626.3 million</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 </span>\u2014 which is less than <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $683 million</span> the schools received <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 but congressional appropriations <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped $700 million</span> in both years.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u201cYou <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 91 out</span> of the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> not paying a single solitary penny\u201d in corporate taxes.\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nTrue.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Progressive Policy, a liberal research organization in Washington, show <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 91 profitable</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> did not pay taxes on the income earned in the United States <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That included companies that reduced their tax liability through deductions for investment, a key aim of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span>\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But data show that the economy <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 failed</span> to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The expansion that stretched <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 through</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 was</span> the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But many people remained on the job market\u2019s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades.</span> And inequality remained very high.

Mr. Biden is referring to the best-case scenario for him, in which Democrats control all of government.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In the scenario of a Democratic sweep, with Mr. Biden winning the presidency and Democrats controlling both the House and Senate, the report projected that the economy would <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\"

refers to the number of people who were employed before the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">It seems to employ some creative rounding: There were <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\"

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>", "displayed_text": "Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2017 study</span> that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top.

Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan.

The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 14 days</span> before the onset of illness,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71 percent</span> of those who tested positive <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 74 percent</span> of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistorically Black colleges and universities, I got them funded, they were on a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business.\u201d\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is exaggerated.\nMr. Trump is taking outsized credit. Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools have received recently. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The president <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">requested $643.9 million</span> in funding for H.B.C.U.\u2019s in <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2019 fiscal</span> year <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $626.3 million</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 </span>\u2014 which is less than <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $683 million</span> the schools received <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 but congressional appropriations <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped $700 million</span> in both years.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u201cYou <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 91 out</span> of the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> not paying a single solitary penny\u201d in corporate taxes.\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nTrue.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Progressive Policy, a liberal research organization in Washington, show <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 91 profitable</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> did not pay taxes on the income earned in the United States <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That included companies that reduced their tax liability through deductions for investment, a key aim of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span>\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But data show that the economy <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 failed</span> to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The expansion that stretched <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 through</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 was</span> the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But many people remained on the job market\u2019s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades.</span> And inequality remained very high.

Mr. Biden is referring to the best-case scenario for him, in which Democrats control all of government.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In the scenario of a Democratic sweep, with Mr. Biden winning the

problem.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe difference between me and the New Green Deal, they say automatically, <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030,</span> we\u2019re going to be carbon free, not possible. My deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal. The New Green Deal calls for elimination of all nonrenewable energy <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span>\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly False.\nThe \u201cNew Green Deal\u201d is not a thing. But it\u2019s a phrasing Mr. Biden has used on more than one occasion to refer to the Green New Deal \u2014 a resolution to tackle climate change championed by progressive climate change groups like the Sunrise Movement and lawmakers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. That plan does not call for the automatic elimination of fossil fuels <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span> Rather it calls for a \u201cten-year mobilization\u201d to achieve net-zero emissions <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span>\nMr. Biden on his website calls the Green New Deal a \u201ccrucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\u201d It is different from his own climate plan, however, which calls for <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spending $2 trillion</span> over four years to boost clean energy development.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nMr. Trump is drawing an inconsequential distinction between the terms \u201cDACA\u201d and Dreamers. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>"}, "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html": {"id": "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
