It isn\u2019t clear what happened to the funds. 1MDB didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">In a statement issued after this article was published, 1MDB said it stood by its audited financial accounts, which describe the collateral payment.</span> The auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, had made \u201cspecific and detailed\u201d inquiries into the collateral transfer before signing off on the accounts, the Malaysian fund\u2019s statement said.\n\nA spokesman for Deloitte in Hong Kong didn't respond Wednesday to a request for comment.\n\nThe dealings between the two countries shines a rare light on the workings of sovereign-wealth funds, which have increased significantly in size and are backed by wealthy governments but often lack transparency. The interactions between the two funds also are attracting scrutiny in Malaysia.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis relationship is beyond a normal business relationship,\u201d said Tony Pua, a member of the Malaysian opposition Democratic Action Party who sits on a parliamentary committee that also is investigating 1MDB.\n\n</span>Ibrahim Al Abed, a spokesman for the U.A.E., declined to comment, as did the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. The office of Mr. Najib, who also is chairman of 1MDB\u2019s board of advisers, didn\u2019t respond to questions. IPIC and Aabar didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the transfers.\n\nThe U.A.E.\u2019s focus on its dealings with 1MDB is the latest in a series of inquiries into the Malaysian fund.\n\nA Malaysian government probe found that <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $700 million</span> moved through banks, agencies and companies linked to 1MDB before being deposited into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged private bank accounts ahead of a close election <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> the Journal reported in July.\n\nThe source of the money is unclear, and the government investigation hasn\u2019t detailed what happened to the funds that allegedly went into Mr. Najib\u2019s personal accounts. Malaysia\u2019s anticorruption body in August said the funds were a donation from the Middle East. The donor wasn\u2019t specified.\n\nThe allegations drew tens of thousands of yellow-clad protesters into the streets of the capital last month. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Malaysia\u2019s currency, the ringgit has fallen to a 17-year low in part due to concerns over the fund.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The 1MDB fund was created to spur economic development by investing in lucrative industries and attracting foreign partners to help finance projects.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The fund has rolled up <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $11 billion</span> in debt to fund purchases of assets, largely made up of power plants and real estate in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka and the U.A.E.\n\nThe 1MDB fund\u2019s assets have failed to generate enough cash, and at times it has rescheduled debt payments.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">1MDB said it hopes to repay the debt by selling assets, which the fund\u2019s management has said are valued at more than its borrowings.\n\n</span>The U.A.E.\u2019s rulers in April dismissed IPIC\u2019s managing director for a number of reasons, including issues related to 1MDB, according to the people familiar with the matter, and replaced him with the emirate\u2019s energy minister.\n\nThe new management team is investigating the previous managers\u2019 actions and relationship with 1MDB, according to the people. They also are in the early stages of crafting a restructuring plan for IPIC, which itself has become heavily indebted, they added.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To help shore up the Malaysian fund, IPIC\u2019s new managers this year cut a deal with Malaysia\u2019s finance ministry to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inject $1 billion</span> into 1MDB to cover a maturing bank loan and agreed to take over <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in power-plant bonds it had guaranteed.</span> In return, the Malaysian government will transfer an equal value of assets to IPIC.\n\nIn the beginning, Malaysia touted ambitious goals for the fund. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Najib sought to use 1MDB to raise Malaysia\u2019s economic development and standing in the world by going beyond its dependence on exports of raw materials such as natural gas, palm oil and rubber.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Najib early on turned to the Middle East, a region with which Malaysia has strong ties based on trade and a shared religion in Islam.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Over the next few years, the U.A.E. pledged to invest billions of dollars in projects through 1MDB, including a plan to turn Kuala Lumpur into a global financial center named after Mr. Najib\u2019s father, Malaysia\u2019s second prime minister.\n\n</span>Little of that money ever flowed. Instead, IPIC agreed to back the Malaysian fund\u2019s power-plant bonds, leading to the payments that are the focus of IPIC\u2019s inquiries.\n\nAabar, the IPIC subsidiary, also helped 1MDB during a disputed audit. According to the Malaysia auditor general\u2019s draft report, 1MDB fired KPMG LLP as its auditor in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2013 after</span> the firm declined to sign off on 1MDB\u2019s accounts unless it received more details <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2.32 billion</span> the fund said was invested in a Cayman Islands account.\n\nAabar stepped in and guaranteed the Cayman Islands funds, an official for Deloitte, which took over as 1MDB\u2019s auditor, told a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary committee probing 1MDB, according to a transcript of the proceedings reviewed by the Journal. This guarantee was never made public. Deloitte later signed off on the fund\u2019s accounts. KPMG and Deloitte declined to comment.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s auditor general plans to issue a full report on 1MDB later this year. The central bank last month said it had completed another report into 1MDB, but details haven\u2019t been made public. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission also is probing allegations that cash flowed into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged accounts.\n\nTwo of the transfers into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged bank accounts <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaling $681 million</span> came from unknown sources via an account held by a British Virgin Islands-based company at Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss bank owned by Aabar, the U.A.E. fund, according to Malaysian investigation documents reviewed by the Journal. Falcon Bank declined to comment.\n\nSwiss authorities said in August that they have opened a criminal probe into what they called suspicious transactions between Switzerland\u2019s banking system and 1MDB.

Malaysian investigators are examining the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into the prime minister\u2019s alleged private bank accounts through entities linked to 1MDB. <span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">The disclosures have sparked a political crisis and set off a handful of investigations around the world, destabilizing the government and damaging confidence in Malaysia\u2019s economy.\n\n</span>Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing and said he didn\u2019t take money for personal gain.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The U.A.E. is trying to sever its ties to the fund and restructure the entity that provided it with financial support, the people said.\n\n</span>The disputed payments are related to the purchase of power plants around the world by the Malaysian fund <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">A state investment fund in Abu Dhabi, the International Petroleum Investment Co., or IPIC, guaranteed <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in bonds that 1MDB issued to finance the purchase, according to the bond offering documents.</span> In return, IPIC was to receive options to buy <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 49% stake</span> in the power plants as well as collateral for the bond.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">According to 1MDB\u2019s financial statements, the Malaysian fund made a collateral payment <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.4 billion</span>.</span> A draft report into 1MDB\u2019s activities by Malaysia\u2019s auditor general, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, said the payment went to a subsidiary of IPIC called Aabar Investments PJS.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">IPIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements, however, contain no reference to the receipt of the payment.</span> Two people familiar with the matter said IPIC and Aabar never received the money. It isn\u2019t clear what happened to the funds. 1MDB didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">In a statement issued after this article was published, 1MDB said it stood by its audited financial accounts, which describe the collateral payment.</span> The auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, had made \u201cspecific and detailed\u201d inquiries into the collateral transfer before signing off on the accounts, the Malaysian fund\u2019s statement said.\n\nA spokesman for Deloitte in Hong Kong didn't respond Wednesday to a request for comment.\n\nThe dealings between the two countries shines a rare light on the workings of sovereign-wealth funds, which have increased significantly in size and are backed by wealthy governments but often lack transparency. The interactions between the two funds also are attracting scrutiny in Malaysia.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis relationship is beyond a normal business relationship,\u201d said Tony Pua, a member of the Malaysian opposition Democratic Action Party who sits on a parliamentary committee that also is investigating 1MDB.\n\n</span>Ibrahim Al Abed, a spokesman for the U.A.E., declined to comment, as did the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. The office of Mr. Najib, who also is chairman of 1MDB\u2019s board of advisers, didn\u2019t respond to questions. IPIC and Aabar didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the transfers.\n\nThe U.A.E.\u2019s focus on its dealings with 1MDB is the latest in a series of inquiries into the Malaysian fund.\n\nA Malaysian government probe found that <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $700 million</span> moved through banks, agencies and companies linked to 1MDB before being deposited into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged private bank accounts ahead of a close election <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> the Journal reported in July.\n\nThe source of the money is unclear, and the government investigation hasn\u2019t detailed what happened to the funds that allegedly went into Mr. Najib\u2019s personal accounts. Malaysia\u2019s anticorruption body in August said the funds were a donation from the Middle East. The donor wasn\u2019t specified.\n\nThe allegations drew tens of thousands of yellow-clad protesters into the streets of the capital last month. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Malaysia\u2019s currency, the ringgit has fallen to a 17-year low in part due to concerns over the fund.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The 1MDB fund was created to spur economic development by investing in lucrative industries and attracting foreign partners to help finance projects.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The fund has rolled up <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $11 billion</span> in debt to fund purchases of assets, largely made up of power plants and real estate in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka and the U.A.E.\n\nThe 1MDB fund\u2019s assets have failed to generate enough cash, and at times it has rescheduled debt payments.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">1MDB said it hopes to repay the debt by selling assets, which the fund\u2019s management has said are valued at more than its borrowings.\n\n</span>The U.A.E.\u2019s rulers in April dismissed IPIC\u2019s managing director for a number of reasons, including issues related to 1MDB, according to the people familiar with the matter, and replaced him with the emirate\u2019s energy minister.\n\nThe new management team is investigating the previous managers\u2019 actions and relationship with 1MDB, according to the people. They also are in the early stages of crafting a restructuring plan for IPIC, which itself has become heavily indebted, they added.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To help shore up the Malaysian fund, IPIC\u2019s new managers this year cut a deal with Malaysia\u2019s finance ministry to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inject $1 billion</span> into 1MDB to cover a maturing bank loan and agreed to take over <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in power-plant bonds it had guaranteed.</span> In return, the Malaysian government will transfer an equal value of assets to IPIC.\n\nIn the beginning, Malaysia touted ambitious goals for the fund. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Najib sought to use 1MDB to raise Malaysia\u2019s economic development and standing in the world by going beyond its dependence on exports of raw materials such as natural gas, palm oil and rubber.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Najib early on turned to the Middle East, a region with which Malaysia has strong ties based on trade and a shared religion in Islam.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Over the next few years, the U.A.E. pledged to invest billions of dollars in projects through 1MDB, including a plan to turn Kuala Lumpur into a global financial center named after Mr. Najib\u2019s father, Malaysia\u2019s second prime minister.\n\n</span>Little of that money ever flowed. Instead, IPIC agreed to back the Malaysian fund\u2019s power-plant bonds, leading to the payments that are the focus of IPIC\u2019s inquiries.\n\nAabar, the IPIC subsidiary, also helped 1MDB during a disputed audit. According to the Malaysia auditor general\u2019s draft report, 1MDB fired KPMG LLP as its auditor in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2013 after</span> the firm declined to sign off on 1MDB\u2019s accounts unless it received more details <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2.32 billion</span> the fund said was invested in a Cayman Islands account.\n\nAabar stepped in and guaranteed the Cayman Islands funds, an official for Deloitte, which took over as 1MDB\u2019s auditor, told a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary committee probing 1MDB, according to a transcript of the proceedings reviewed by the Journal. This guarantee was never made public. Deloitte later signed off on the fund\u2019s accounts. KPMG and Deloitte declined to comment.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s auditor general plans to issue a full report on 1MDB later this year. The central bank last month said it had completed another report into 1MDB, but details haven\u2019t been made public. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission also is probing allegations that cash flowed into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged accounts.\n\nTwo of the transfers into Mr. Najib\u2019s alleged bank accounts <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaling $681 million</span> came from unknown sources via an account held by a British Virgin Islands-based company at Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss bank owned by Aabar, the U.A.E. fund, according to Malaysian investigation documents reviewed by the Journal. Falcon Bank declined to comment.\n\nSwiss authorities said in August that they have opened a criminal probe into what they called suspicious transactions between Switzerland\u2019s banking system and 1MDB.

Now, software to block ads on these gadgets has arrived \u2014 and the harsh realities of the practice are causing second thoughts.\nJust two days after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps through its new mobile operating system, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">iOS 9,</span> users are embracing the new technology after long complaining that the ads track them, slow down web browsers and are just plain annoying. In less <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 48 hours</span>, several ad-blocking apps with names like Peace, Purify and Crystal soared to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store chart.\nYet some web publishers are now fretting that ads on their sites can\u2019t be viewed because of the blockers, which could threaten these publishers\u2019 livelihoods. On Friday, the maker of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3 ad</span>-blocking app Peace, Marco Arment, removed his program from the App Store and offered refunds, saying that while stopping ads does \u201cbenefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don\u2019t deserve to be hit.\u201d\nThis about-face highlights the complexities around the ethics of ad blocking. Advertising underlies much of the Internet, making it possible for people to make a living off the Internet and create the content that users consume. By limiting ads, that implicit contract was violated, some publishers and advertisers said. More distinctions now need to be made around what qualifies as \u201cgood\u201d online advertising versus \u201cbad\u201d ads that should be blocked, they said \u2014 though they were less clear on who would decide what constitutes a good or bad ad.\n\u201cWhen ad blockers became the most downloaded apps in the App Store, it forced publishers and advertisers to rethink the role that advertising plays on the web,\u201d said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said that Apple enabled ad blocking in the new version of its mobile software to give customers the option to block content \u201cfor an improved mobile browsing experience.\u201d\nAd blocking is not new; people have been able to use ad-blockers on their desktop web browsers for some time. But the number of people installing ad blockers has increased with the arrival of blockers on mobile devices because so much computing has now moved to those devices.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">That means the potential for ad blocking to dent revenue for websites and advertisers is increasing.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 16 percent</span> of those who use the Internet in the United States, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 45 million</span> people, have already installed an ad blocker, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 48 percent</span> over the <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 12 months</span>, said Sean Blanchfield, who runs PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad blocking. <span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">In a report last month, Adobe and PageFair calculated that blockers would cost publishers <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $22 billion</span> in revenue <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span>\n</span>The potential toll of ad blocking has become particularly apparent over the last few days, when several website publishers got caught in the dragnet after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps.

Now, software to block ads on these gadgets has arrived \u2014 and the harsh realities of the practice are causing second thoughts.\nJust two days after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps through its new mobile operating system, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">iOS 9,</span> users are embracing the new technology after long complaining that the ads track them, slow down web browsers and are just plain annoying. In less <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 48 hours</span>, several ad-blocking apps with names like Peace, Purify and Crystal soared to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store chart.\nYet some web publishers are now fretting that ads on their sites can\u2019t be viewed because of the blockers, which could threaten these publishers\u2019 livelihoods. On Friday, the maker of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3 ad</span>-blocking app Peace, Marco Arment, removed his program from the App Store and offered refunds, saying that while stopping ads does \u201cbenefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don\u2019t deserve to be hit.\u201d\nThis about-face highlights the complexities around the ethics of ad blocking. Advertising underlies much of the Internet, making it possible for people to make a living off the Internet and create the content that users consume. By limiting ads, that implicit contract was violated, some publishers and advertisers said. More distinctions now need to be made around what qualifies as \u201cgood\u201d online advertising versus \u201cbad\u201d ads that should be blocked, they said \u2014 though they were less clear on who would decide what constitutes a good or bad ad.\n\u201cWhen ad blockers became the most downloaded apps in the App Store, it forced publishers and advertisers to rethink the role that advertising plays on the web,\u201d said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said that Apple enabled ad blocking in the new version of its mobile software to give customers the option to block content \u201cfor an improved mobile browsing experience.\u201d\nAd blocking is not new; people have been able to use ad-blockers on their desktop web browsers for some time. But the number of people installing ad blockers has increased with the arrival of blockers on mobile devices because so much computing has now moved to those devices.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">That means the potential for ad blocking to dent revenue for websites and advertisers is increasing.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 16 percent</span> of those who use the Internet in the United States, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 45 million</span> people, have already installed an ad blocker, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 48 percent</span> over the <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 12 months</span>, said Sean Blanchfield, who runs PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad blocking. <span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">In a report last month, Adobe and PageFair calculated that blockers would cost publishers <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $22 billion</span> in revenue <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span>\n</span>The potential toll of ad blocking has become particularly apparent over the last few days, when several website publishers got caught in the dragnet after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps.
