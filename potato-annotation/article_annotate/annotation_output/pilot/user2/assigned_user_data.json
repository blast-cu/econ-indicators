This November, she will join the ranks of Stella McCartney, Versace, Lanvin and Karl Lagerfeld as the next designer to collaborate with global mass retailer H&M, where she will also debut a men's collection.\n\nIt's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. \"I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,\" she says. \"It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nToday,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> \"We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. \"They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.\"\n\nMarant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. \"I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,\" she says. \"It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.\"\n\nON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with \"Mister Freedom\" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.\n\n\"I always wear my own clothes,\" she says. \"My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe.\" She laughs and adds, \"I get a good discount. She's very nice to me.\" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. \"I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?\"\n\n\"It's about the women surrounding me,\" she continues. \"I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse\u2014that's a fantasy.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe\u2014and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: \"You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing her instincts has generally served Marant well. \"Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,\" she says. \"It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so.\" She continues, \"During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare\u2014when it happens your heart is beating.\" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)\n\nShe begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. \"This takes time,\" she says. \"Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less.\" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. \"I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],\" she says. \"It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.\"\n\nIn person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. \"I think sometimes I should dye it,\" she says. \"And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' \" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.\n\nHer low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. \"I'm not this goddess of fashion\u2014I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,\" she says. \"I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.\"\n\nHer eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean \u00e9migr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Everybody is linked,\" Marant says of her large family. \"I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.\"\n\nTheir differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. \"My mother is quite German,\" she says, \"Very bio-ecologique\u2014very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.\"\n\nMarant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. \"They became my family,\" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. \"They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit.\" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)\n\nAs a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself. She'd leave the house dressed demurely, \"but I had a plastic bag of stuff and I would go to the next building and change,\" she says. After high school, she attended the Studio Ber\u00e7ot fashion school in Paris. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She started an accessories line <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989,</span> followed by launching a self-financed womenswear line in a tiny studio <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> when she was <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 26 years</span> old.\n\n</span>Several years later, she fell in love with accessories designer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dreyfuss, who now has stores next to hers in Paris's 6th arrondissement and in New York's Soho. She says the two regard work as a separate endeavor, and don't swap ideas. \"It's very restful,\" she says. \"My previous boyfriends all said, 'You spend all the time at the office and don't love me.' I never have to justify myself to J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.\"\n\nMarant is quite content to have those conversations with herself. In recent years, she has mined Americana for her collections\u2014surf, cowgirl, Elvis, Navajo theme, with studs and grommets galore\u2014but her fall/<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">winter 2013 collection</span> was a staid departure. What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. \"I had a kind of sadness,\" she says. \"I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.\"\n\nTomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: \"I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,\" she says. \"I love cooking\u2014all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans.\" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: \"If you have a nice house outside of Paris,\" she explains, \"you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nShe is still seeking to find that balance in her business\u2014although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> \"I don't want to be on every corner. If I open everywhere, then it becomes common. I don't want to overflow the world with Isabel Marant.\"\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "The French fashion designer's brand of effortless chic is practically a uniform for off-duty models and movie stars in the know.

Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. \"I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,\" she says. \"It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nToday,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> \"We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. \"They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.\"\n\nMarant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. \"I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,\" she says. \"It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.\"\n\nON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with \"Mister Freedom\" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.\n\n\"I always wear my own clothes,\" she says. \"My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe.\" She laughs and adds, \"I get a good discount. She's very nice to me.\" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. \"I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?\"\n\n\"It's about the women surrounding me,\" she continues. \"I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse\u2014that's a fantasy.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe\u2014and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: \"You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing her instincts has generally served Marant well. \"Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,\" she says. \"It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so.\" She continues, \"During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare\u2014when it happens your heart is beating.\" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)\n\nShe begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. \"This takes time,\" she says. \"Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less.\" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. \"I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],\" she says. \"It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.\"\n\nIn person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. \"I think sometimes I should dye it,\" she says. \"And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' \" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.\n\nHer low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. \"I'm not this goddess of fashion\u2014I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,\" she says. \"I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.\"\n\nHer eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean \u00e9migr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Everybody is linked,\" Marant says of her large family. \"I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.\"\n\nTheir differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. \"My mother is quite German,\" she says, \"Very bio-ecologique\u2014very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.\"\n\nMarant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. \"They became my family,\" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. \"They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit.\" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)\n\nAs a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself. She'd leave the house dressed demurely, \"but I had a plastic bag of stuff and I would go to the next building and change,\" she says. After high school, she attended the Studio Ber\u00e7ot fashion school in Paris. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She started an accessories line <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989,</span> followed by launching a self-financed womenswear line in a tiny studio <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> when she was <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 26 years</span> old.\n\n</span>Several years later, she fell in love with accessories designer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dreyfuss, who now has stores next to hers in Paris's 6th arrondissement and in New York's Soho. She says the two regard work as a separate endeavor, and don't swap ideas. \"It's very restful,\" she says. \"My previous boyfriends all said, 'You spend all the time at the office and don't love me.' I never have to justify myself to J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.\"\n\nMarant is quite content to have those conversations with herself. In recent years, she has mined Americana for her collections\u2014surf, cowgirl, Elvis, Navajo theme, with studs and grommets galore\u2014but her fall/<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">winter 2013 collection</span> was a staid departure. What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. \"I had a kind of sadness,\" she says. \"I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.\"\n\nTomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: \"I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,\" she says. \"I love cooking\u2014all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans.\" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: \"If you have a nice house outside of Paris,\" she explains, \"you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nShe is still seeking to find that balance in her business\u2014although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> \"I don't want to be on every corner. If I open everywhere, then it becomes common. I don't want to overflow the world with Isabel Marant.\"\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "29761": {"id": "29761", "text": "Government says the cars are unsafe in a country where cars drive in the right lane; locals object to being steered toward left-hand-drive models\n\nDec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21,</span><span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 5</span>:33 am ET\n\nYANGON, Myanmar\u2014Driving a car here is like waiting for an accident to happen.\n\nMore than nine out <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 cars</span> in Myanmar are right-hand drive, as they are in Britain and Japan, but the cars drive on the right-hand side of the road as they do in the U.S. That combination occurs as in few other places.\n\nDrivers are perched toward the curb, instead of the center of the road, and can\u2019t easily judge when to overtake.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) about an important education debate involving how student progress should be measured. The query essentially rendered her speechless as she appeared not to know how to answer. When Franken told her he was upset she didn\u2019t understand it, she did not protest.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">That was just one of several moments during the hearing in which DeVos either displayed a lack of knowledge about education fundamentals or refused to answer questions that Democratic members of the Senate Education Committee believe are critical to her fitness for the job.\n</span><span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">[Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job]\nHere are some of the notable moments:\n- DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect against grizzly bears.</span> (She really said this.)\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her whether she would agree that guns don\u2019t belong in schools, she said: \u201cI will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.\u201d\nAnd when asked whether she would support President-elect Donald Trump if he, as he has promised, moves to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: \u201cI will support what the president-elect does.\u201d She added: \u201cIf the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence.\u201d\n[Do guns belong in schools? Trump\u2019s education pick declines to take a stand.]\n- DeVos seemed to have no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities.\nDeVos said that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA, but when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) later told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it, DeVos responded, \u201cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.\u201d Hassan then asked, \u201cSo were you unaware when I just asked you about the IDEA that it was a federal law?\u201d DeVos responded, \u201cI may have confused it.\u201d DeVos did not protest when Hassan said she was upset the nominee didn\u2019t understand the law and urged her to learn about it.\n[Betsy DeVos apparently \u2018confused\u2019 about federal law protecting students with disabilities]\n- DeVos refused to agree with Sen.

When Franken told her he was upset she didn\u2019t understand it, she did not protest.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">That was just one of several moments during the hearing in which DeVos either displayed a lack of knowledge about education fundamentals or refused to answer questions that Democratic members of the Senate Education Committee believe are critical to her fitness for the job.\n</span><span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\">[Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job]\nHere are some of the notable moments:\n- DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect against grizzly bears.</span> (She really said this.)\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her whether she would agree that guns don\u2019t belong in schools, she said: \u201cI will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.\u201d\nAnd when asked whether she would support President-elect Donald Trump if he, as he has promised, moves to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: \u201cI will support what the president-elect does.\u201d She added: \u201cIf the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence.\u201d\n[Do guns belong in schools?

Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) later told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it, DeVos responded, \u201cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.\u201d Hassan then asked, \u201cSo were you unaware when I just asked you about the IDEA that it was a federal law?\u201d DeVos responded, \u201cI may have confused it.\u201d DeVos did not protest when Hassan said she was upset the nominee didn\u2019t understand the law and urged her to learn about it.\n[Betsy DeVos apparently \u2018confused\u2019 about federal law protecting students with disabilities]\n- DeVos refused to agree with Sen.

Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2017 study</span> that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top. Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study\u2019s co-author told The Times.\n\u201cFifty thousand in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan.

The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 14 days</span> before the onset of illness,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71 percent</span> of those who tested positive <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 74 percent</span> of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistorically Black colleges and universities, I got them funded, they were on a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business.\u201d\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is exaggerated.\nMr. Trump is taking outsized credit. Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools have received recently. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The president <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">requested $643.9 million</span> in funding for H.B.C.U.\u2019s in <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2019 fiscal</span> year <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $626.3 million</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 </span>\u2014 which is less than <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $683 million</span> the schools received <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 but congressional appropriations <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped $700 million</span> in both years.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u201cYou <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 91 out</span> of the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> not paying a single solitary penny\u201d in corporate taxes.\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nTrue.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Progressive Policy, a liberal research organization in Washington, show <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 91 profitable</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> did not pay taxes on the income earned in the United States <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That included companies that reduced their tax liability through deductions for investment, a key aim of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span>\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But data show that the economy <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 failed</span> to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The expansion that stretched <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 through</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 was</span> the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But many people remained on the job market\u2019s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades.</span> And inequality remained very high.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>", "displayed_text": "Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"a1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"a1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2017 study</span> that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top.

Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan.

The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 14 days</span> before the onset of illness,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71 percent</span> of those who tested positive <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 74 percent</span> of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistorically Black colleges and universities, I got them funded, they were on a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business.\u201d\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is exaggerated.\nMr. Trump is taking outsized credit. Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools have received recently. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The president <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">requested $643.9 million</span> in funding for H.B.C.U.\u2019s in <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2019 fiscal</span> year <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $626.3 million</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 </span>\u2014 which is less than <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $683 million</span> the schools received <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 but congressional appropriations <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped $700 million</span> in both years.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u201cYou <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 91 out</span> of the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> not paying a single solitary penny\u201d in corporate taxes.\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nTrue.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Progressive Policy, a liberal research organization in Washington, show <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 91 profitable</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> did not pay taxes on the income earned in the United States <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That included companies that reduced their tax liability through deductions for investment, a key aim of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span>\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But data show that the economy <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 failed</span> to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The expansion that stretched <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 through</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 was</span> the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But many people remained on the job market\u2019s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades.</span> And inequality remained very high.

Trump\nThis is misleading.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the country was <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 160 million</span> jobs refers to the number of people who were employed before the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">It seems to employ some creative rounding: There were <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 152.5 million</span> workers on nonfarm payrolls (the typically used number) in February, before the pandemic hit.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It is also a misleading number to use in isolation, because the number of employees climbs with the size of the population.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The employment-to-population ratio stood <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 61.1 percent</span> in February, substantially lower than <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 64.7 percent</span> high in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2000,</span> at the tail end of the Clinton administration.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Even looking at the prime age employment-to-population rate to account for the fact that population aging could depress employment rates, they remained lower in <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 than</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000.</span>\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">It is also not true that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has created more jobs than prior administrations.\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nAsked during the September presidential debate to condemn white supremacist and militia groups, Mr. Trump said \u201csure, I\u2019m willing\u201d but did not outright denounce them. \u201cI would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,\u201d he said as Mr. Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, pressed for a condemnation.\nMr. Trump then asked for a specific group to denounce, to which Mr. Biden responded \u201cProud Boys.\u201d\n\u201cProud Boys stand back and stand by,\u201d he said, going on to add that \u201csomebody\u2019s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe difference between me and the New Green Deal, they say automatically, <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030,</span> we\u2019re going to be carbon free, not possible. My deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal. The New Green Deal calls for elimination of all nonrenewable energy <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span>\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly False.\nThe \u201cNew Green Deal\u201d is not a thing. But it\u2019s a phrasing Mr. Biden has used on more than one occasion to refer to the Green New Deal \u2014 a resolution to tackle climate change championed by progressive climate change groups like the Sunrise Movement and lawmakers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. That plan does not call for the automatic elimination of fossil fuels <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span> Rather it calls for a \u201cten-year mobilization\u201d to achieve net-zero emissions <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2030.</span></span></span>\nMr. Biden on his website calls the Green New Deal a \u201ccrucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\u201d It is different from his own climate plan, however, which calls for <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spending $2 trillion</span> over four years to boost clean energy development.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nMr. Trump is drawing an inconsequential distinction between the terms \u201cDACA\u201d and Dreamers. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>"}, "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html": {"id": "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
