trending near a four-decade low.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cClosing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,\u201d Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">There were more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 505,000 apprentices</span> in training in fiscal <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">year 2016,</span> the Labor Department said.</span> That was the highest level on record back <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\"

enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nBefore running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A senior White House official said the show didn\u2019t inspire the policy push. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Rather, the president\u2019s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common.</span> But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Of the more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8,000 active</span> apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 20% are</span> in manufacturing.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.\n\n</span>Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $90 million</span> in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they\u2019re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 40%.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cContinuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,\u201d said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThose cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.\n\n</span>Defense firm Northrop Grumman has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive Wes Bush said businesses need the government\u2019s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don\u2019t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.\n\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur nation\u2019s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today\u2019s workers,\u201d he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cUnfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.\u201d\n\n</span>Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> print edition as 'Apprentice Programs to Get Boost'.", "displayed_text": "<h1>You\u2019re Hired: Trump Plans to Build U.S. Workforce With Apprenticeships</h1><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president, who hosted NBC\u2019s reality television show \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 will announce an expansion of apprenticeship programs\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017 2</span>:00 pm ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump next week will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.\n\n</span>Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Nine <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 10 Americans</span> who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is $60,000 a</span> year, according to the Labor Department.\n\n</span>The administration is committed to \u201csupporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,\u201d Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and assistant, said Friday. \u201cThere has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.\"\n\nWhite House officials discussing the president\u2019s goals on Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress.

tracking the figure at the end <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2000.</span></span> At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cClosing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,\u201d Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">There were more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 505,000 apprentices</span> in training in fiscal <span id=\"6\"

enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nBefore running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A senior White House official said the show didn\u2019t inspire the policy push. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Rather, the president\u2019s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common.</span> But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Of the more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8,000 active</span> apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 20% are</span> in manufacturing.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.\n\n</span>Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $90 million</span> in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they\u2019re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 40%.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cContinuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,\u201d said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThose cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.\n\n</span>Defense firm Northrop Grumman has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive Wes Bush said businesses need the government\u2019s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don\u2019t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.\n\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur nation\u2019s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today\u2019s workers,\u201d he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cUnfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.\u201d\n\n</span>Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> print edition as 'Apprentice Programs to Get Boost'."}, "3475": {"id": "3475", "text": "<h1>Family\u2019s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h1>ISTANBUL \u2014 When Alan Kurdi\u2019s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria\u2019s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.\nAs a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan\u2019s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.\nAn aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat. Dozens of other relatives \u2014 aunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.\nAnd just weeks after Alan\u2019s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.\n\u201cWe die together, or we live together and make a future,\u201d her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.\nAlan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria\u2019s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.\nSo when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.\nInterviews <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.\nSince Alan\u2019s death, at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.\nAlan\u2019s father, Abdullah, who <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat. He was trying to steer it in the chaos when it foundered in the waves.\nBut even for Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun, grieving her nephew, the calculus remained in favor of risking her children to save them. Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.\nKurdish Roots\nAlan\u2019s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.\n</span>They had six children. They remember living modest lives not much affected by tensions between the government and Kurds. They spent the summers harvesting olives in Kobani, but saw themselves as city kids. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Most left school after ninth grade to learn the family\u2019s barbering trade.\n</span>Fatima, the oldest daughter, was the first to emigrate. <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1992,</span> she moved to Canada to marry an Iraqi Kurd. They soon divorced, and she raised their son. Working nights in a printing plant, she caught the attention of a kindly boss.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Every night I\u2019ll teach <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">you 10 English</span> words,\u2019\u201d Fatima, known as Tima, recalled recently. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe rest I got from watching \u2018Barney\u2019 with my son.\u201d\nEnglish led to a hairstyling license, jobs at high-end salons and citizenship \u2014 successes that made the family\u2019s later journeys possible.\n</span>A commanding presence, Fatima became her siblings\u2019 source of advice, information and emergency cash. When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan\u2019s death a force for change.\nBut before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp \u2014 all places soon to be shattered by violence.\nDriven From Damascus\nThe ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.\nAs the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan\u2019s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family\u2019s Damascus barbershop.\nSome of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, \u201cI participated.\u201d\nThe government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.\n\u201cAfter the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,\u201d Abdullah recalled. \u201cAny simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.\u201d\nOne day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis\u2019 in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.\nNext, Alan\u2019s cousin Shergo,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.\nGovernment artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus \u2014 where an armed insurgency was taking shape \u2014 from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.\nThe Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan\u2019s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.\nThose two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.\nThe flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy\u2019s leg.\nAt the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.\n\u201cSo I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave,\u2019\u201d Shergo\u2019s mother, Ghousoun recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s better than if they take us.\u201d\nKobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Life on the Run\nAt first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun\u2019s family in her cowshed.\nBack in Kobani, the Kurdi clan\u2019s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.\nMany of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.\nA Way Station in Turkey\nAbdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, \u201clike a chain on my hands.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.\n</span>\u201cThey sat in the house all day,\u201d he said, choking with tears. \u201cThe only thing they were waiting for was me.\u201d\nOther Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.\nThe promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan\u2019s aunt Fatima <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.\nHivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016.</span>\nOptions dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.\nIn June, Mohammad took a smugglers\u2019 boat to Greece and made it to Germany.\nAlan\u2019s cousin Yasser,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler\u2019s boat out of Turkey.\nDisasters at Sea\nHivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.\n</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.\nOn the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.\nHivrun\u2019s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.\nSoon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. \u201cWe had decided to go to paradise,\u201d Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe \u2014 or the hereafter.\nHours after Alan\u2019s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, \u201cJust keep his head above water!\u201d But all three drowned, one by one.\nOther survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, \u201cI\u2019m with you; don\u2019t worry,\u201d just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.\nIn the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers\u2019 practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.\nAbdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because \u201csomeone had to.\u201d\nRegardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.\nLittle Solace\nWithin hours, Alan\u2019s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.\nFrom her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada\u2019s red tape and the world\u2019s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.\n\u201cThose kids were born when the war was on,\u201d she recalled telling Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees. \u201cAnd they die with the war still on.\u201d\nHer raw message helped spur Western countries \u2014 briefly, at least \u2014 to open their doors to Syrians.\nBut none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.\nIn the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.\n\u201cThe most important thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to be together.\u201d\nFor the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.\nIn Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat \u2014 \u201ca horror film!\u201d one said \u2014 but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.\nTheir father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.\nTo the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.\nHe misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am!\u201d\nGhousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads \u201cKurdi.\u201d\n</span>\u201cPeople always need a haircut,\u201d she said.\nA Father\u2019s Heartache\nA few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters\u2019 phone numbers, even his dentures.\n\u201cI have become a shadow,\u201d Abdullah said.\nAfter he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.\nBarely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.\nBut he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: \u201cWhere was all this when my children were alive?\u201d\nHe called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family\u2019s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons\u2019 favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.\n\u201cI want something,\u201d he said, \u201cwith their smell.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h1>Family\u2019s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h1>ISTANBUL \u2014 When Alan Kurdi\u2019s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria\u2019s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.\nAs a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan\u2019s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.\nAn aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat.

Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family\u2019s Damascus barbershop.\nSome of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, \u201cI participated.\u201d\nThe government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.\n\u201cAfter the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,\u201d Abdullah recalled. \u201cAny simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.\u201d\nOne day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis\u2019 in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.\nNext, Alan\u2019s cousin Shergo,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.\nGovernment artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus \u2014 where an armed insurgency was taking shape \u2014 from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.\nThe Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan\u2019s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.\nThose two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.\nThe flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy\u2019s leg.\nAt the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.\n\u201cSo I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave,\u2019\u201d Shergo\u2019s mother, Ghousoun recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s better than if they take us.\u201d\nKobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Life on the Run\nAt first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun\u2019s family in her cowshed.\nBack in Kobani, the Kurdi clan\u2019s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.\nMany of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.\nA Way Station in Turkey\nAbdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, \u201clike a chain on my hands.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.\n</span>\u201cThey sat in the house all day,\u201d he said, choking with tears. \u201cThe only thing they were waiting for was me.\u201d\nOther Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.\nThe promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan\u2019s aunt Fatima <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.\nHivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016.</span>\nOptions dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.\nIn June, Mohammad took a smugglers\u2019 boat to Greece and made it to Germany.\nAlan\u2019s cousin Yasser,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler\u2019s boat out of Turkey.\nDisasters at Sea\nHivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.\n</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.\nOn the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.\nHivrun\u2019s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.\nSoon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. \u201cWe had decided to go to paradise,\u201d Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe \u2014 or the hereafter.\nHours after Alan\u2019s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, \u201cJust keep his head above water!\u201d But all three drowned, one by one.\nOther survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, \u201cI\u2019m with you; don\u2019t worry,\u201d just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.\nIn the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers\u2019 practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.\nAbdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because \u201csomeone had to.\u201d\nRegardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.\nLittle Solace\nWithin hours, Alan\u2019s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.\nFrom her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada\u2019s red tape and the world\u2019s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.\n\u201cThose kids were born when the war was on,\u201d she recalled telling Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees. \u201cAnd they die with the war still on.\u201d\nHer raw message helped spur Western countries \u2014 briefly, at least \u2014 to open their doors to Syrians.\nBut none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.\nIn the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.\n\u201cThe most important thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to be together.\u201d\nFor the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.\nIn Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat \u2014 \u201ca horror film!\u201d one said \u2014 but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.\nTheir father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.\nTo the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.\nHe misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am!\u201d\nGhousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads \u201cKurdi.\u201d\n</span>\u201cPeople always need a haircut,\u201d she said.\nA Father\u2019s Heartache\nA few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters\u2019 phone numbers, even his dentures.\n\u201cI have become a shadow,\u201d Abdullah said.\nAfter he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.\nBarely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.\nBut he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: \u201cWhere was all this when my children were alive?\u201d\nHe called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family\u2019s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons\u2019 favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.\n\u201cI want something,\u201d he said, \u201cwith their smell.\u201d"}, "89359": {"id": "89359", "text": "<h1>Enabling of Ad Blocking in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 Prompts Backlash</h1>For years, people have longed for ways to stop advertising from popping up on their iPhones and iPads.
