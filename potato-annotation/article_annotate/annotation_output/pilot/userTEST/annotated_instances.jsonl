They said Mr. Trump is likely to offer more specifics in the coming days. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">He plans to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer, which federal or state governments certify.</span> Workers are trained for skills businesses need and provided hands-on experience. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Since workers are paid while they learn, programs can attract younger Americans seeking to avoid student debt and displaced older workers who need new skills but can\u2019t attend years of college.\n\n</span>Such programs could also address an emerging shortage of skilled workers. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">There were more than six million job openings in April, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2000.</span></span> At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cClosing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,\u201d Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">There were more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 505,000 apprentices</span> in training in fiscal <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">year 2016,</span> the Labor Department said.</span> That was the highest level on record back <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2001,</span> but only <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20,000 higher</span> than the previous peak <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003.</span> And the figure is much smaller than <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 13.3 million</span> students enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nBefore running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A senior White House official said the show didn\u2019t inspire the policy push. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Rather, the president\u2019s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common.</span> But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Of the more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8,000 active</span> apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 20% are</span> in manufacturing.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.\n\n</span>Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $90 million</span> in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they\u2019re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 40%.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cContinuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,\u201d said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThose cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.\n\n</span>Defense firm Northrop Grumman has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive Wes Bush said businesses need the government\u2019s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don\u2019t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.\n\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur nation\u2019s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today\u2019s workers,\u201d he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cUnfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.\u201d\n\n</span>Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> print edition as 'Apprentice Programs to Get Boost'.", "label_annotations": {"frame-macro": {"Yes": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the US economy": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting better": "0"}, "frame": {"Firm-specific": "0"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 7s "}}
