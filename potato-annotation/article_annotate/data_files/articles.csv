World Health Organization scientists who are tracing the pandemic’s origin in China said the coronavirus had probably spread through an animal host.
A team of World Health Organization scientists said on Tuesday in China that the coronavirus had probably first spread to humans through an animal and was “extremely unlikely” to have been the result of a lab accident.
The findings, delivered <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 12 days</span> of field work by the team visiting Wuhan, China, were the first step in a painstaking process to trace the pandemic’s origins, a question that is critical to helping prevent a recurrence.
“All the work that has been done on the virus and trying to identify its origin continue to point toward a natural reservoir,” said Dr. Peter K. Ben Embarek, a food safety scientist with the W.H.O. who is leading the team of experts. He was speaking at a news conference in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first discovered late <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019.</span>
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Dr. Embarek dismissed the idea that the virus might have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, a theory that has gained currency among some officials and experts in the United States and elsewhere.</span> “It was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,” he said, citing safety protocols.
The W.H.O. experts largely focused their comments on the scientific aspects of their mission, but the inquiry has been in many ways overshadowed by politics. The Chinese government has continued to suggest that the virus may have originated overseas, an idea that many scientists discount. Chinese officials on Tuesday used the news conference to promote this theory, arguing that the search for the virus’s origin should focus on places outside China.
The investigation will “not be restricted to any location,” said Liang Wannian, who led the team of Chinese scientists assisting in the W.H.O. mission.
The W.H.O. experts at the three-hour news conference did not challenge the statements by the Chinese officials. They pledged to examine reports of early cases of the virus outside China. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">They also called for more research into the animals that were sold at a sprawling market in Wuhan where some of the first cases of the virus were detected.
</span>For the W.H.O., the visit also served as a chance to dispel criticism that it is too deferential to China.
For months, experts and politicians have denounced the W.H.O. for allowing the Chinese government to control the inquiry into the source of the pandemic. Chinese officials, wary of drawing attention to missteps during the outbreak, repeatedly delayed the visit by W.H.O. experts and sought to limit the scope of their mission. The Chinese government, acquiescing to growing global pressure, allowed the team <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 14 scientists</span> into Wuhan last month.
People with dementia have significantly greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, and are much more likely to be hospitalized and die from it, than people without dementia do, a new study of millions of medical records in the United States has found.
Their risk could not be entirely explained by characteristics common to people with dementia that are known risk factors for Covid-19: old age, living in a nursing home, and having conditions like obesity, asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. After researchers adjusted for those factors, Americans with dementia were still twice as likely to have gotten Covid-19 as of late last summer.
“It’s pretty convincing in suggesting that there’s something about dementia that makes you more vulnerable,” said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.
The study found that Black people with dementia were nearly three times as likely as white people with dementia to become infected with the virus, a finding that experts said probably reflects the fact that people of color generally have been disproportionately harmed during the pandemic.
“This study highlights the need to protect patients with dementia, especially those who are Black,” the authors wrote.
The study was led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who analyzed electronic health records <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 61.9 million</span> people <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 18 and</span> older in the United States from Feb.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 through</span> Aug.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020.</span> The data, collected by IBM Watson Health Explorys, came <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 360 hospitals</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 317,000 health</span> care providers across <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span> and represented a fifth of the American population, the authors said.
The researchers found that out <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15,770 patients</span> with Covid-19,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 810 of</span> them also had dementia. When the researchers adjusted for general demographic factors — age, sex and race — they found that people with dementia had more than three times the risk of getting Covid-19. When they adjusted for Covid-specific risk factors like nursing home residency and underlying physical conditions, the gap closed somewhat, but people with dementia were still twice as likely to become infected.
Experts and the study authors said the reasons for this vulnerability might include cognitive and physiological factors.
“Folks with dementia are more dependent on those around them to do the safety stuff, to remember to wear a mask, to keep people away through social distancing,” said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study. “There is the cognitive impairment and the fact that they are more socially at risk.”

As the European Union began its campaign to line up vaccines, it was slower off the mark, focused on prices while the United States and Britain made money no object, and succumbed to an abundance of regulatory caution.</span> All of those things have left the bloc flat-footed as drugmakers fall behind on their promised orders.
But <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 27 countries</span> of the European Union are also attempting something they have never tried before and have broken yet another barrier in their deeper integration — albeit shakily — by casting their lot together in the vaccine hunt.
In doing so, they have inverted the bloc’s usual power equation. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Bigger, richer countries like Germany and France — which could have afforded to sign contracts directly with drugmakers, as the United States and Britain did — saw their vaccine campaigns delayed by the more cumbersome joint effort, while smaller countries wound up with better supply terms than they were likely to have negotiated on their own.
</span>For the bulk of E.U. nations, that experiment has been beneficial. But it has not necessarily been greeted happily in the wealthiest countries, and it has left leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France open to criticism at home.
They and E.U. leaders have nonetheless stood by their decision and the impulse for solidarity, even as the finger-pointing has begun.
“What would people have said if Germany and France had been in competition with one another for the purchase or production of vaccines? That would have been chaos,” Mr. Macron said at a news conference on Friday after a virtual meeting with Ms. Merkel. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“That would have been counterproductive, economically and from a public health perspective, because we will only come out of this pandemic when we have vaccinated enough people in Europe.”
</span>But even as the leaders of Europe’s traditional power duo talked up <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2.3 billion</span> doses ordered as an indication of the wisdom of a joint approach, they conceded that a full campaign could not be expected before March.
Just <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 3 percent</span> of E.U. nationals had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of last week, compared <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 17 percent</span> in Britain <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 9 percent</span> in the United States.
A million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine had been shipped recently to South Africa from India. The first injections were set for Wednesday. After weeks of rich countries vaccinating doctors and nurses against the coronavirus, a respite from the anxiety and the trauma seemed to be nearing in South Africa, too.
Then, all of a sudden, the plans were shelved. The country’s leaders on Sunday ordered the rollout of the vaccine halted after a clinical trial failed to show that it could prevent people from getting mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 caused by the coronavirus variant that has overrun the country.
The new findings from South Africa were far from conclusive: They came from a small clinical trial that enrolled fewer <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2,000 people</span>. And they did not preclude what some scientists say is the likelihood that the vaccine protects against severe disease from the variant — a key indicator of whether the virus will overwhelm hospitals and kill people.
But even if the vaccine is shown to prevent severe disease, scientists say, what happened in South Africa is a warning to the world. As quickly as scientists developed vaccines, the virus has seemed to evolve even more quickly. Instead of eradicating the virus, scientists now foresee months, if not years, of vaccine makers continually having to update their booster shots to protect against new variants.
And if the variant first seen in South Africa, now present <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 32 countries</span>, becomes the dominant form of the virus elsewhere, those countries could face a far slower crawl out of the pandemic.
The news was not all bad. Other vaccines offer some protection against the variant from South Africa, though less than against earlier versions of the virus. Among them is Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which prevented hospitalizations and deaths in clinical trials in the country. Despite not yet being authorized there, it could be rolled out to some health workers by mid-February as part of what officials vaguely described as “a research project.”
AstraZeneca is working to produce a version of its vaccine that can protect against the variant from South Africa by the fall.
Still, the findings rattled scientists, undercutting the notion that vaccines alone will stop the spread of the virus anytime soon. And they led to new, and more urgent, demands that richer countries donate doses to poorer countries that could become breeding grounds for mutations if the virus spreads unchecked.
A number of coronavirus variants are raising worries that they may draw out the pandemic or make vaccines less effective. Here are four that have been in the news lately and what we know about them.
B.1.1.7
First emerged in Britain.
Thought to be <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 percent</span> more infectious than earlier versions.
Preliminary evidence suggests that it is <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 percent</span> more deadly.
Current vaccines appear to work well against it.
This variant has been detected in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 70 countries</span>, including the United States, where it is doubling roughly <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 10 days</span>. Experts predict that it could become the country’s dominant source of infection by March. Learn more about B.1.1.7.
B.1.351
First identified in South Africa.
Vaccines may be less effective against it.
South Africa halted its use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine on Sunday after evidence emerged that the vaccine did not protect against mild or moderate illness caused by B.1.351. The variant has spread to at <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 24 countries</span>, including the United States, where it has been detected in Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia.
P.1
First emerged in Brazil.
May be able to overcome immunity developed after infection by other variants.
A close relative of B.1.351, this variant has spread to several countries, including the United States, where it has been detected in Minnesota and Oklahoma.
CAL.20C
First discovered in California.
It is not yet clear whether it is more infectious.
This variant was found in more than half of the coronavirus test samples that were screened in Los Angeles.

Democrats roll out a plan to <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">send $1,400 stimulus</span> payments to Americans earning up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $75,000 a</span> year.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">House Democrats on Monday rolled out a main plank of President Biden’s stimulus plan, proposing legislation to send direct payments <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1,400 to</span> Americans earning up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $75,000 a</span>nd households with incomes up <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $150,000.</span>
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The plan, drafted the day before key committees are scheduled to begin meeting to consider it, is at odds with proposals from some Republicans and moderate Democrats who want to curtail eligibility for direct payments, targeting it to lower-income people.</span> Mr. Biden has said he is open to such modifications.
For now, the measure would allow individuals paid up <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $100,000 and</span> households up <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $200,000 to</span> be eligible for some payment, though the size of the checks would phase out gradually for those with incomes <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $75,000,</span> <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $150,000 for</span> a family.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The bill, unveiled by Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was one of a series that Democrats presented on Monday ahead of a week of legislative work to solidify the details of Mr. Biden’s stimulus proposal.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The decision to keep the income cap at the same level as the last round of stimulus payments comes after days of debate among the House Democratic caucus over the size of the checks.</span> Some moderates pushed to restrict the full amount to those who <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make $50,000 or</span> less and households making up <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $100,000.</span>
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The legislation also includes significant changes to the tax code and an increase in an extension of weekly federal unemployment benefits.</span> It would raise the $300-a-week payment <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $400 a</span> week and continue the program — currently slated to begin lapsing in March — through the end of August.
<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $1.9 trillion</span> plan would also provide for billions of dollars for schools, colleges, small businesses, and a provision that would increase the federal minimum wage <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $15 by</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025,</span> a progressive priority.
</span>With nearly a year of coronavirus experience behind them, leaders at many universities in the United States ushered in the new term pledging not to repeat the errors of last year, when infection rates soared on campuses and in the surrounding communities.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">But although most schools have pledged to increase testing, it is an expensive proposition at a time when many are struggling financially, and not all are testing students as often as recommended by public health experts.
</span>The plans to keep the virus under control, for example, at the University of Michigan — which had more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2,500 confirmed</span> cases by the end of the fall semester — included increasing testing, offering more courses online, limiting dorm rooms to one occupant and offering no tolerance for rules violations. Yet already more <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 new</span> virus cases have been announced by the school since Jan.<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span>
Other universities across the country have also encountered obstacles to a smooth spring, including the unexpected challenge of emerging variants — detected in recent days at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, Tulane University in New Orleans and the University of California, Berkeley — and the more common problem of recalcitrant students.
At Vanderbilt University in Nashville, students returning after winter break were required to be tested upon arrival and were then asked to avoid social interactions while awaiting results. But some had other ideas.
“We identified a cluster of positive Covid-19 cases linked to students who did not follow the arrival shelter-in-place rules,” a campuswide email reported on Jan.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> blaming two student organizations for violating protocols. “More <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 students</span> are now in quarantine.”
The foundation of most university plans for the spring semester centers on increased testing to identify infected students before they display symptoms, and then placing them in isolation. The testing push has grown since July, when a study recommended that students be tested twice a week to better detect asymptomatic infections.
The American College Health Association later embraced the idea, issuing guidelines in December. “For the spring, we specifically recommend that all students are tested on arrival and twice a week thereafter if possible,” said Gerri Taylor, a co-chair of the organization’s Covid-19 task force.
Ms. Taylor said her organization did not know what percentage of schools had adopted the recommendations, and a survey of colleges across the country revealed a variety of requirements, ranging from voluntary testing to mandatory testing twice a week.

In Bolivia, bodies are piling up at homes and on the streets again, echoing the horrific images of last summer, when a deadly surge in coronavirus infections overwhelmed the country’s fragile medical system. The Bolivian police say that in January they <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">recovered 170 bodies</span> of people thought to have died from Covid-19, and health officials say intensive-care units are full.
“<span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">When 10 or</span><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 patients</span> die, their beds are full again in a few hours,” said Carlos Hurtado, a public health epidemiologist in Santa Cruz, Bolivia’s largest city.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The resurgence of the virus in Bolivia is part of a larger second wave throughout Latin America, where some of the world’s strictest quarantine measures are giving way to pandemic fatigue and concerns about the economy.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund said on Monday that it was revising <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2021 growth</span> forecast for Latin America and the Caribbean <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.1 percent</span> <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.6 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Warning that the surge in cases could threaten an economic recovery that is already expected to take longer than in other parts of the world, the fund predicted that regional output will not return to pre-pandemic levels <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023.</span>
</span>While the number of new cases is falling, deaths remain at near-record highs in many parts of the region, just as some governments begin vaccination efforts.
Brazil and Mexico have each been averaging <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 1,000 daily</span> Covid-19 deaths for weeks; their total pandemic death toll is now surpassed only by that of the United States. Deaths in Brazil have matched their summer peak, while in Mexico they are far higher than any earlier peak, though they have begun falling in recent days.
In Bolivia last summer, mortality figures reviewed by The New York Times suggested that the country’s real death toll was nearly five times the official tally, indicating that Bolivia had suffered one of the world’s worst epidemics. <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 20,000 more</span> people died from June through August than in past years, according to a Times analysis — a vast number in a country of <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11 million</span> people.
Bolivia is now reporting an average <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 60 coronavirus</span> deaths per day, approaching the numbers from last summer. Experts believe the higher mortality rate is caused by the more contagious virus variants originating in neighboring Brazil and elsewhere, but they lack the instruments to analyze the virus’s genetic code.
Despite the rising death rate, the Bolivian authorities have not implemented the quarantine measures used to help curb the virus’s first wave a year ago. Officials in Bolivia and other Latin American nations are touting their nascent vaccination programs as a reason to avoid lockdowns, even though few countries in the region beyond Brazil have procured a meaningful number of doses.
<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 20,000 vaccine</span> doses have arrived in Bolivia, although the government says it plans to vaccinate eight million people by September.

Those who lie about where they have been could face prison terms of up <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 years</span>, Britain’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. The list of affected countries include Portugal, as well as most of South America and southern Africa.

An expansion of Alabama’s lagging Covid-19 vaccination program drew large crowds of people on Monday as the state opened the last of eight new sites for inoculations.
The centers are a huge expansion of a vaccination program that has struggled to gain traction. <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 7.7 percent</span> of eligible Alabamians have gotten at least one vaccine dose, according to a New York Times database, placing the state last among <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 50 states</span> and the District of Columbia.
Long lines of cars formed outside a downtown stadium in Selma, a hospital parking deck in Dothan and the site of a former shopping mall in Montgomery, where teams of workers delivered vaccinations through car windows. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Shots were available to anyone <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 65 and</span> to select groups that included educators, farm workers, grocery employees and state legislators.
</span>Before the centers opened, only <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 700,000 medical</span> workers, emergency medical workers, nursing home residents and <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">people 75 and</span> over were eligible to be vaccinated. The opening of the eight centers coincided with an expansion of eligibility for vaccination that raised that total to about<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span>5 million.
Each of the eight centers is equipped to <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">give 5,000 vaccinations</span> by week’s end. By comparison, workers at Southeast Health medical center in Dothan had vaccinated fewer <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,700 people</span> since vaccines first became available in late December, the hospital spokesman, Mark Stewart, said in an interview.

As the pandemic persists around the world, every month <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 130 billion</span> disposable face masks are ending up in landfills, city streets, rivers, beaches and oceans — posing a stark risk to the environmental.
In a study published last week, Australian researchers proposed a potential solution: recycling the used face masks into roads.
“At the beginning of the pandemic, I wished I were a doctor,” said Mohammad Saberian, a civil engineer at RMIT University who is the paper’s lead author. Then he realized that he, too, had an urgent role to play: figuring out what to do with pandemic-generated detritus.
The paper, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, looked at how face masks could be combined with other recycled construction materials to reduce waste from the pandemic while reducing reliance on other materials like plastic, which is often used as filler in roads. The researchers found that about three million masks could be put into a two-lane road of more than half a mile, and that those roads were likely to be stronger and more flexible than some made with nonrecycled materials.
“This research not only works, but it can also provide real engineering benefit,” Dr. Saberian said, adding that he hoped the next step would involve building a prototype of the road to fully test its functionality.
To conduct their experiment, researchers heated the masks to simulate disinfecting them. They then shredded the masks into strips and mixed them with recycled concrete. Eventually, the researchers were left with hard cylindrical samples, which they tested by applying weight, heat and moisture.
The project is not the first to recycle materials into roads, nor is it the first to consider what to do with the masses of discarded personal protective equipment, the production of which has surged since last year. Companies such as TerraCycle, which collect personal protective equipment from homes and businesses, have also grown in popularity in recent months.
“We’ve seen spikes in single-used consumption all over the place, and this technology shows a path for using these materials,” said Jonathan Krones, an industrial ecologist at Boston College who was not involved in the study.
He and other scientists said, however, that better solutions involved reducing consumption and the manufacturing of disposable materials, even in a pandemic. “What I really want to see happening is us divorcing ourselves from this idea that disposability equals sanitation,” Dr. Krones said.
“It’s so good to see people.”
That was Naomi Osaka, the three-time Grand Slam champion, moments after her first-round win on Monday afternoon at the Australian Open. She stood at a microphone on the court at Rod Laver Arena and peered up at a crowd that seemed, if not normal, then something like it.
That was how it was on Monday across the grounds of Melbourne Park, where international sports returned, however temporarily, to something like it was before the pandemic.
Spectators lined up for tickets. They waited in security lines, pondered whether to order burgers or fish and chips, and decided how <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">many $13 beers</span> they could stomach.

71631,"<h3>Janet Yellen will discuss sanctions on Russian gold with lawmakers.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Daily Business Briefing
Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, will discuss imposing sanctions on Russia’s gold reserves with a bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday, according to people with knowledge of the plans, as the United States and Europe prepare to level a new round of sanctions on Russian lawmakers this week.
</span>The focus on gold reserves comes amid concerns that Russia is trying to utilize alternative assets to evade international sanctions and help prop up the ruble. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States and its Western allies have taken steps to cut Russia off from much of the global financial system by freezing its international currency reserves and imposing sanctions on several major financial institutions and oligarchs.
</span>Ms. Yellen plans to discuss proposed legislation to target Russia’s gold reserves with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, and Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Secretary Yellen regularly meets with members of Congress to discuss legislation,” said Morgan Finkelstein, a Treasury spokeswoman.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Additionally, Treasury staff frequently provide technical assistance on sanctions bills.”
</span>Plans for a meeting this week between Ms. Yellen and lawmakers were reported earlier by Axios.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Lawmakers have been working on a variety of bills that would tighten sanctions and restrict trade with Russia.</span> The Biden administration has broad authority to act alone on many of these measures, but Congress sometimes enacts legislation to pressure or force action from the White House.
The sanctions on gold reserves were proposed earlier this month and would block Russia from selling gold on international markets. The senators suggested that Russia’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $130 billion</span> worth of gold reserves were a loophole in the sanctions that were imposed on Russia’s central bank. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They said that Russia was laundering money through gold by buying and selling it for high-value currency.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Eswar Prasad, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, said that targeting gold would be another step in “tightening the financial noose around Russia.”
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Gold sales are not specifically banned by the existing sanctions that are in place.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The lawmakers who drafted the legislation are seeking to understand why the Treasury Department appears to be reluctant to impose sanctions on Russia’s gold reserves, according to one of the people with knowledge of their thinking.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Treasury Department has not said that it is seeing Russia use gold to evade sanctions, though it has made clear that use of alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies would be a violation of U.S. law.
</span>President Biden is expected to announce additional sanctions this week on hundreds of members of Russia’s lower house of Parliament and new measures to crack down on sanctions evasion during a series of global summits in Europe on Thursday.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Nestlé said Wednesday that it was suspending sales of its KitKat and Nesquik brands in Russia, the latest effort from a global consumer giant to rethink operations there as the country wages war on Ukraine.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Global brand owners including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola have been under pressure to pull out of Russia as Western countries try to squeeze Russia’s economy and thwart its ability to fund the war.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But these brands are balancing concerns, such as leaving behind investments in brands and factories, potentially disrupting complex supply chains and supporting sometimes sizable workforces.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Nestlé said it was suspending sales of “the vast majority” of its prewar volume of products in Russia, including pet food, coffee and candy.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It had already halted “nonessential” imports and exports into and out of Russia, alongside advertising and capital investment.</span> The company is also fully complying with all international sanctions on Russia, it said.
“While we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia, any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations,” the company said Wednesday.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Nestlé said its business in Russia would “focus on providing essential food” to residents, like infant food and medical nutrition.</span> Other brands, like Danone and PepsiCo, have similarly said they would continue production of food and products deemed basic necessities. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Critics have said such moves undermine efforts to starve the Russian economy and pressured companies to make all-or-nothing breaks from Russia.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Maintaining even limited operations in Russia would make it easier for brands to restart broader business there, when or if they needed to.
</span>Lawmakers in the United States, Britain and Ukraine have urged companies to cut ties, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has specifically pointed to Nestlé.
“‘Good food. Good life.’ This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia,” Mr. Zelensky said on Saturday in a video message addressing antiwar protesters in Bern, Switzerland.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and their allies have shaken the Russian economy and caused the value of the ruble to plunge.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">On Wednesday President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came up with a way to get his opponents to help prop up his currency, by demanding that “unfriendly countries” use rubles to buy the Russian oil and gas that is still flowing.
</span>“I have made a decision to implement in the shortest possible time a set of measures to switch payments for … our natural gas supplied to the so-called unfriendly countries to Russian rubles,” Mr. Putin said on Wednesday.
Sanctions aimed at the Russian central bank effectively froze hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The actions immediately drove down the value of the ruble as people frantically rushed to turn their rubles into a more stable currency, like the dollar or the euro.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The central bank took several steps to support the currency, including doubling interest rates <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> as a way to entice people to keep their rubles in the bank.
</span>That freeze, Mr. Putin said, was evidence that the dollar and euro “compromised themselves” and were unreliable.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the action means that every time a Western country buys a barrel of oil it would be “propping up his domestic currency.”
</span>“If you’re invoiced in rubles, you’ve got to go out and buy rubles,” he said. “I don’t know if there is workaround.”
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">In Britain, the economic shock waves of the war in Ukraine are exacerbating a squeeze on household budgets and heightening fears of a cost of living crisis.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The British government on Wednesday announced some measures to help people cope with the rising prices, which are at their highest level in three decades, including cutting gas prices.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the sanctions on President Vladimir V. Putin’s government and the efforts to isolate Russia were also weighing on the British economy.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">This was most acutely felt in the cost of living, he said.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">“The actions we have taken to sanction Putin’s regime are not cost-free for us at home,” Mr. Sunak told lawmakers as he announced an update to the Treasury’s tax and budget plans on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Hours earlier, the Office for National Statistics said inflation was at its highest level <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1992,</span> with prices rising <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6.2 percent</span> from a year earlier.
</span>The interventions announced on Wednesday were limited. For a year, the government will cut taxes on petrol and diesel <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5 pence</span> a liter. (The rate had been frozen for more than a decade.) <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Local authorities will get <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 500 million</span> pounds to support low-income households.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">And the biggest announcement of the day was the raise to the income threshold that workers must meet before they begin to pay National Insurance, a broad tax that funds state pensions and some benefits.
</span>“The cut in fuel duty, though very welcome, is just a drop in the ocean compared to the larger tsunami of surging costs that is bearing down on firms and households,” Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said in a statement.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent economic and fiscal forecasts for the government, downgraded its outlook for the economy.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Gross domestic product will <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increase 3.8 percent</span> this year <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.8 percent</span> next year, it said on Wednesday.</span> Six months ago, the agency forecast a growth <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 6 percent</span> this year <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.1 percent</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Inflation will <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 7.4 percent</span> this year and won’t fall back below the central bank’s target <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 percent</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2024,</span> it said.
</span>The outlook for household incomes was even bleaker. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">With inflation factored in, household disposable incomes per person will drop <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2.2 percent</span> in the next fiscal year beginning in April, the Office for Budget Responsibility said.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">That would be the largest fall in a single financial year since official records began <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956.</span>
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">Despite the deteriorating economic outlook, Mr. Sunak seemed reluctant to deviate too far from his previous spending and tax plans.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">It was the Treasury’s first fiscal announcement since Britain ended its pandemic restrictions, having already spent about £311 billion ($410 billion) in the first year of the pandemic on health services, businesses and workers.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">And Mr. Sunak has repeatedly stated the need to repair the public finances, temporarily raise some taxes and reduce government spending.
</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">The government was pushing ahead with a plan to raise National Insurance for employers and workers from next month, to ease the backlog at the National Health Service and fund adult social care.
</span>Stellantis, maker of Chryslers and Jeeps, and LG will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $4 billion</span> on a new battery factory in Ontario.
Stellantis and a partner, LG Energy Solution, said on Wednesday that they would jointly build a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, to provide the critical components for a range of electric Jeeps and trucks the automaker aims to introduce over the next several years.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">The two companies expect to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $4.1 billion</span> in the factory and <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">create 2,500 jobs</span>.</span> Stellantis, which was formed last year through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French automaker Peugeot, has long operated a minivan plant in Windsor.
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">The new factory is the latest in a series of plants auto manufacturers have said they will build in North America as they rush to produce electric cars and trucks and catch up to Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing market for electrics.</span> General Motors expects a battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, to start production this summer, and it is building a second one in Tennessee. Ford Motor has announced plans to build two battery plants in Kentucky and a third in Tennessee. Toyota has chosen North Carolina for a battery plant.
Stellantis said this month that it aimed to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">introduce 25 electric</span> vehicles in the United States <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2030 and</span> that it planned to build at least two battery plants in North America. The new models include an electric Jeep to be introduced next year and an electric Ram pickup truck <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024.</span>
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">“Our joint venture with LG Energy Solution is yet another steppingstone to achieving our aggressive electrification road map in the region, aimed at <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hitting 50 percent</span> of battery-electric vehicle sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of the decade,” Stellantis’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, said in a statement.

Bankers racked up their highest bonuses ever in New York last year, but their good fortune may be running out.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">Employees in New York City’s securities industry got extra payouts <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaging $257,500 in</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 20 percent</span> from their previous peak a year earlier, according to an estimate by Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller.
</span>“Wall Street’s soaring profits continued to beat expectations <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021 and</span> drove record bonuses,” Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement on Wednesday. “But recent events are likely to drive near-term profitability and bonuses lower.”
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Markets remain turbulent during the recovery from the pandemic, and Russia’s war on Ukraine only increases the uncertainty of the global economic outlook, Mr. DiNapoli said.
</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">The surge in compensation in the financial sector surpassed the city’s projections and will allow it to raise more income-tax revenue than it had expected, even as the pandemic continues to weigh on other industries.</span> <span id=""46"" class=""red"">“We won’t get back to our pre-Covid economic strength until more New Yorkers and more sectors — retail, tourism, construction, the arts and others — enjoy similar success,” Mr. DiNapoli said.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 180,000 employees</span> in the securities industry comprise <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 5 percent</span> of the city’s private sector work force but account for a fifth of its wages, according to the estimates.</span> <span id=""48"" class=""red"">One in nine jobs in New York City are connected to Wall Street.
</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">Still, the pay bumps haven’t stopped droves of bankers from changing jobs amid pandemic-inspired ennui, blockbuster profits and fierce competition for talent.</span> Itchy feet have forced big banks to open their wallets: Compensation costs at the nation’s six largest lenders <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12 percent</span> to <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $178 billion</span> combined last year.
<span id=""50"" class=""red"">The Swiss bank UBS will offer a slice of its U.S. employees the chance to work remotely all the time.
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">It will select eligible workers for the program from <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 20,500 U</span>.S. employees in the next few months, starting with its wealth management division, it said in a statement.</span> A bank spokeswoman said the company ultimately expects <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span> of those workers to go fully remote. Three-quarters could work on a hybrid basis, according to the spokeswoman, Erica Chase.
<span id=""52"" class=""red"">The first cohort of work-from-home roles could include data analysts, business managers, project managers and operations staff, followed by compliance and finance roles outside the wealth unit.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 800 UBS</span> employees are currently working remotely on a permanent basis.
</span><span id=""54"" class=""red"">“This framework will provide an enhanced work-life balance for some of our employees, appeal to a more diverse pool of applicants and increase employee retention,” Tom Naratil, the president of UBS in the Americas, said in a statement.</span> “We recognize the world has changed.”
<span id=""55"" class=""red"">UBS <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">said 86 percent</span> of employees it surveyed valued more flexibility.
</span><span id=""56"" class=""red"">Ralph Hamers, the bank’s chief executive, has embraced hybrid working — more so than the leaders at some American banking giants, who have been eager to get employees back into their offices, albeit with mixed success.</span> After several false starts, executives at companies of all types have rolled out a flurry of return-to-office plans in recent weeks.
<span id=""57"" class=""red"">Marc Montanaro, UBS’s head of human resources in the Americas, said the bank recognized that employees are more satisfied and productive when they have greater control over their schedules.
</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“Our employees have different needs and demands on their time based on their location, family and personal life, career stage and other factors — some of which change over time,” he said.
</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">The Education Department says it will hold companies that own certain private colleges financially responsible for taxpayers’ losses if their schools defraud students or abruptly shut down.
</span>“If a company owns, controls or profits from a college, it should also be on the hook if the institution fails students,” James Kvaal, the department’s under secretary, said in the announcement on Wednesday.
Taxpayers have been left with billions of dollars in losses in recent years when student loans made by the government were wiped out because the students were victimized by the schools they attended. The vast majority of those losses stem from for-profit schools that have come under increasing scrutiny for their educational practices.
<span id=""60"" class=""red"">When a college suddenly closes, stranded students can have their federal student loan debt forgiven through what’s known as a closed-school discharge.</span> <span id=""61"" class=""red"">Another relief program, called borrower defense to repayment, can eliminate the federal student loan debt of students who were significantly misled by their school’s false claims.</span> In both cases, taxpayers are typically stuck paying the tab.
The department will require the new guarantees on a rolling basis, as schools sign or renew the agreements that let them receive federal student loan funds. <span id=""62"" class=""red"">It plans to demand them from private colleges and universities showing signs of potential distress and from those changing ownership.
</span>A series of collapses at large for-profit chains have sent claims through both relief programs soaring in recent years. Last month, the Education Department approved borrower-defense claims for thousands of students who attended DeVry University — the first time it has granted claims at a still-operating school. <span id=""63"" class=""red"">The department said it would try to recoup some of that cost — at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $72 million</span>, with the bill likely to grow — from DeVry’s current owner, which bought the long-troubled school <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span>
</span>The new policy does not guarantee that taxpayers will be repaid for future claims, however. Most investors or organizations that buy schools do so through holding companies, and if the institution implodes, the holding company is typically left with few assets.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> for example, dozens of schools owned by Dream Center, a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education, collapsed barely a year after the organization bought them. While Dream Center is still operating, the entity that owned the schools — Dream Center Educations Holdings — is in receivership.
But the new rule also allows the Education Department to require companies with “substantial control” over schools to sign these agreements. <span id=""64"" class=""red"">That could make investment companies, including some private equity firms that are active in the for-profit education market, responsible for the debt if their schools fail.
</span>“Too often the department has seen those who reap the rewards of colleges’ actions when things go well leave us holding the bag when things go badly,” said Richard Cordray, the head of the department’s Federal Student Aid division. “We will be vigilant in our oversight and enforcement of this new policy.”
BRUSSELS — Strict state-aid rules that prevent European governments from subsidizing companies will be loosened, the European Union said on Wednesday, so that states can support businesses hit hard by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions that have been imposed in response.
The European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, said that it had agreed on a “temporary crisis framework” that would apply to state aid. The new temporary rules will allow member states to subsidize companies if they can show that they have suffered losses because of European sanctions against Russia, or Russian sanctions imposed in response to them.
<span id=""65"" class=""red"">Three kinds of aid will be permitted, the commission said in a statement: Governments will be allowed to give companies money; to extend credit lines so that companies stay financially healthy; and to directly compensate companies if they’ve suffered “additional costs incurred due to exceptionally high gas and electricity prices,” especially if they are so-called “energy-intensive” businesses.
</span><span id=""66"" class=""red"">The commission laid out details of how such state aid might work, including by capping it in certain cases, limiting how much money governments can provide for businesses that are affected by the war and its impact on energy prices, or more broadly.
</span><span id=""67"" class=""red"">The looser state-aid measures show that the European Union, which is normally very strict on restricting payments to companies and regularly fines governments for overstepping, is prepared to rewrite the rule book in view of the mounting economic costs that the broad E.U. sanctions on Russia are incurring at home.
</span><span id=""68"" class=""red"">And while the new rules are described as “temporary,” there is no specific timeline in the statement for a return to the normal way of doing business.
</span><span id=""69"" class=""red"">BRUSSELS — European Union countries are starting a fraught but urgent debate on how to immediately deal with booming energy prices and the prospect of fuel shortages, both linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as they attempt to cut remaining ties to Russia’s economy.</span> The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled a set of options for E.U. leaders to look at during a meeting later in the week.
The bloc faces a dual energy crisis as its broad sanctions against Russia, along with sanctions from the United States and other Western allies, are failing to stop President Vladimir V. Putin’s plans for the war on Ukraine.
<span id=""70"" class=""red"">Energy prices, already significantly higher this year because of the pandemic, are spiraling out of control, posing dire implications for European consumers and businesses.</span> <span id=""71"" class=""red"">Energy costs are not only slowing down the bloc’s postpandemic economic recovery but also fueling inflation, which is at a historic high, and further undermining growth.
</span><span id=""72"" class=""red"">And as the bloc contemplates how to urgently wean itself off Russian oil and gas — and prepares for the possibility that Russia might itself decide to cut or disrupt supply to Europe — E.U. countries are facing shortages for next winter.</span> How to fill that gap, and make their sanctions against Russia more effective, hinges on a complex joint operation of buying and storing fuels across the bloc.
<span id=""73"" class=""red"">European Union leaders are set to discuss their options and possibly reach some early agreement in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, but the debate is acrimonious, as some countries want direct market interventions to subsidize consumers while others would prefer minimal tinkering with market dynamics.
</span><span id=""74"" class=""red"">The options paper presented by the European Commission on Wednesday included different ways of curbing energy prices for consumers and businesses, by intervening at the wholesale and retail levels through price caps, price subsidies and other types of interventions, including cutting tax costs for energy spending.
</span>The paper also lays out ways in which the bloc can take a leap into jointly buying fuels and storing them communally. That would mean that the storage for oil, gas and liquefied natural gas in one E.U. state could also be used to save fuels for another member that didn’t have sufficient storage capacity. <span id=""75"" class=""red"">The goal of these options would be to fill up storage facilities immediately and guarantee sufficient supply for the entire European Union for next winter.
</span>The commission proposal would mandate that member states fill <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 80 percent</span> of their underground storage facilities, which would require mass purchases in the immediate future, during the year’s warmer months.
<span id=""76"" class=""red"">All the options under consideration, the commission said in its options analysis, would cost E.U. governments money and probably distort global energy pricing and availability in the spring and summer, especially if E.U. leaders agree to make mass joint energy purchases immediately.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Deficits typically widen during economic downturns, but they have been climbing in the U.S. for the past five years, despite sturdy economic growth.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The annual budget gap was on track to <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed $1 trillion</span> this year even before the pandemic, following Republican tax cuts enacted <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 that</span> constrained revenues and two bipartisan budget deals that boosted spending.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Up until March, when the pandemic began to spread widely across the country and widespread lockdowns began, the budget gap <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2020 largely</span> mirrored the shortfall during the same period <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Federal spending from October through March was <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 6.8%,</span> while revenues <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 6.4%,</span> Treasury officials said.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Much of the spending increase can be tied to efforts to mitigate the economic downturn that resulted from the pandemic, officials said.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Spending by the Small Business Administration, which administered the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $577 billion</span>, up <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $456 million</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Spending by the Labor Department, which administers unemployment benefits, jumped <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $477 billion</span> <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 from</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $36.4 billion</span> in <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2019.</span>
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Spending for other safety-net programs, including Medicaid, Social Security and nutrition assistance, also climbed, along with outlays for new programs such as the coronavirus relief fund for cities and states and one-<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">time $1,200 stimulus</span> payments to households.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">During the first half of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal<span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span></span></span> federal receipts rose, as a strong economy and low unemployment boosted corporate and individual tax revenues.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">From April through September, however, receipts declined as the virus brought economic activity to a standstill, businesses shut down and more <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 million</span> workers lost their jobs.

16829,"<h3>U.S. Imposes Steel and Aluminum Tariffs on EU, Canada, and Mexico</h3>The United States ended a delay of steel and aluminum tariffs for the European Union, Canada, and Mexico with a proclamation on Thursday.
The proclamation means that steel and aluminum tariffs <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 and</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 percent</span>, respectively, temporarily delayed for these and various other countries, will now be imposed on the EU, Canada, and Mexico.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Findings of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">section 232 investigations</span> into the effect of steel and aluminum imports on the national security of the United States were released in January.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Donald Trump concurred in a March proclamation with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s findings from the January reports that included “steel mill articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.”
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">As a result of these findings, President Trump imposed <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 25 percent</span> tariff on steel imports.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The president added a caveat that countries could discuss with the U.S. “alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country.”</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A similar finding was issued regarding aluminum imports.
</span>Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the European Union took advantage of the offer. The U.S. afforded delay in implementation of the tariffs based on the “important security relationship” with each of these countries and pending continued discussions of the issue.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Canada and Mexico were given the delay pending the ongoing NAFTA trade negotiations.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Those negotiations have continued, but U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has expressed at times that the negotiations have not progressed as quickly as had been hoped.
</span>The U.S. came to “satisfactory alternative” agreements with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to extend exemption while details of those were finalized. The agreements were outlined in Thursday’s proclamation.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker responded to news of the U.S. tariffs on the EU, calling the decision “protectionism, pure and simple,” according to the Associated Press. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It’s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade,” said Junker, who threatened the EU would soon issue “counterbalancing measures.”

Mark</span> Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, displayed the social network’s enormous financial clout on Thursday, even as the company has dealt with regulatory scrutiny and advertiser boycotts.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Facebook’s revenue for the second quarter <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 11 percent</span></span> from a year earlier <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $18.7 billion</span>, while profit <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 98 percent</span> <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5.2 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The results were well above analysts’ estimates <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $17.3 billion</span> in revenue with a profit <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $3.9 billion</span>, according to data provided by FactSet.
More than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world.</span> And <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 2.47 billion</span> people use one or more of Facebook’s apps every day.
The company said its number of monthly active users <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12 percent</span> from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders around the world.
“We’re glad to be able to provide small businesses the tools they need to grow and be successful online during these challenging times,” said Mr. Zuckerberg, who was grilled by lawmakers on Wednesday over Facebook’s power. “And we’re proud that people can rely on our services to stay connected when they can’t always be together in person.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Facebook’s earnings have long been a bright spot for the Silicon Valley company.</span> Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, users have continued coming back to its services. Because of this, advertisers have consistently spent money on the platform.
But that started changing in late June when a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate For Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to pull back their spending because of issues of hate speech on the site. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Facebook has tried to assuage the concerns, but has made it clear that it will not change its policy about free speech on the site based on outside threats to the business.
</span>Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The company warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could also eventually affect its bottom line.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon on Thursday reported record sales and profits in the latest quarter.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Amazon <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had $88.9 billion</span> in quarterly sales, <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 40 percent</span> from a year earlier.</span> Profit doubled, <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5.2 billion</span></span>, even though the company invested heavily to improve the safety in Amazon’s warehouses.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Analysts expected the company to <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have $81.4 billion</span> in sales <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $665 million</span> in profit, according estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Shares in the company jumped more <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6 percent</span> in after-hours trading.
</span>“Simply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,” Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The profit came even as Amazon <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invested $9 billion</span> in expanding warehouses and other capital expenditures to increase its capacity.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s a good problem to have,” Brian Olsavsky, the company’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters.
</span>In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $4 billion</span> on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $300 million</span> for testing its work force for the virus.
“If you’re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we’re not thinking small,” he said at the time.
Amazon had been paying workers an <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra $2 an</span> hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time “thank you” bonus <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $500 for</span> full-time associates in its warehouses.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 48 percent</span>.</span> As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“E-commerce is off the charts right now,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but “demand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,” he said.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The number of products it sold <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 57 percent</span>, but the number of employees it had was up <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 34 percent</span>.
</span>On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $2 billion</span> in the quarter.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Sales at Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 29 percent</span>, <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $10.8 billion</span>, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Alphabet said its revenue <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percent</span> <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $38.3 billion</span> in the second quarter compared with a year ago.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 17 years</span> as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts’ expectations for revenue and profit.</span> Net profit <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $6.96 billion</span>, <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 30 percent</span> from a year ago.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Ford Motor said Thursday it <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earned $1.1 billion</span> in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost $1.9 billion</span> excluding interest and taxes.</span> The result was better than Ford’s earlier forecast of a pretax loss <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5 billion</span>.
The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost $758 million</span> in the second quarter.
Ford said in a statement that it expected “no further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production” in the second half of the year. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But the company also said it was not expecting “meaningful change in the current economic conditions.”
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The automaker forecast that it would <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earn $500 million</span> <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.5 billion</span> on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services.
</span>Ford’s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 645,000 in</span> the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $954 million</span> setback in North America.
The company used <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $5.3 billion</span> in cash in the quarter, but said it still <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has $39 billion</span> on hand at the end of June.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Ford recorded a gain <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $3.5 billion</span> from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI.
From April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed — and Apple made a <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $11.25 billion</span> in profits.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world’s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Apple said its sales <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 11 percent</span></span> <span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $59.7 billion</span> and its profits <span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 12 percent</span> <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $11.25 billion</span>.</span> Both figures handily beat analysts’ expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Revenue rose for all of Apple’s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple’s lofty standards.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple’s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Even the iPhone, which remains the company’s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple’s devices.</span> “Our products and services are very relevant to our customers’ lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,” he said.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies’ power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it.</span> “We believe we’ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,” he said.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Investors have flocked to Apple’s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 percent</span> this year to a <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $1.67 trillion</span> value.

Economic output fell at its fastest pace on record last spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close their doors and kept millions of Americans shut in their homes for weeks.

The collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Unlike past recessions, this one was a result of a conscious decision to suspend economic activity to slow the spread of the virus.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to sustain households and businesses, limit long-term damage and allow for a rapid rebound.
</span>The plan worked at first. In recent weeks, however, cases have surged in much of the country. <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Data from public and private sources indicate a pullback in economic activity, reflecting consumer unease and renewed shutdowns.
</span>“In another world, a sharp drop in activity would have been just a good, necessary blip while we addressed the virus,” said Heather Boushey, president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank. “From where we sit in July, we know that this wasn’t just a short-term blip.”
<span id=""45"" class=""red"">The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits <span id=""95"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled 1.43 million</span> last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</span>It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy’s nascent recovery.</span> Claims for the previous week <span id=""96"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled 1.42 million</span>.
<span id=""47"" class=""red"">New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government’s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, <span id=""97"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled 830,000,</span> down <span id=""98"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 975,000 the</span> week before.</span> Those numbers, unlike the figures for state claims, are not seasonally adjusted.

“We’re still in a desperate situation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Chicago.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">Noting that weekly claims were in <span id=""107"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 200,000 range</span> before the pandemic brought widespread shutdowns in March, she added, “This is unique in terms of the speed and magnitude of the job losses.”
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">What’s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states reversing the reopening of businesses.
</span>“Everyone wants to keep putting on rose-colored glasses, but it’s blinding us to the reality of the situation and what we have to deal with,” Ms. Swonk said.
<span id=""51"" class=""red"">At the same time, <span id=""108"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $600 supplemental</span> weekly unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial blow to millions.</span> Republicans have proposed replacing the supplement with <span id=""109"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $200 weekly</span> payment, while Democrats want to extend it in full. “We’re nowhere close to a deal,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Wednesday.
<span id=""52"" class=""red"">Consumer spending, the bedrock of the U.S. economy, <span id=""110"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">plunged 10.1 percent</span> in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.</span> It was by far the biggest drop on record. But the decline wasn’t across the board — and the details help paint a picture of life in a pandemic.
<span id=""53"" class=""red"">Spending on services <span id=""111"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 13.3 percent</span>, led by a near-total collapse in spending on restaurant meals and recreation, the department’s report on quarterly economic output noted.</span> Health care spending fell sharply, too, as patients canceled elective procedures and delayed routine care.
Spending on goods was a different story. <span id=""54"" class=""red"">Overall goods expenditures fell a <span id=""112"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">modest 3 percent</span>, and some quarantine-friendly categories actually had increases.</span> Spending on recreational vehicles and related goods rose <span id=""113"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 9 percent</span> as consumers sought ways to travel without getting on airplanes.
<span id=""55"" class=""red"">Other parts of the economy showed large contractions.</span> <span id=""56"" class=""red"">Business investment, residential construction and trade — both imports and exports — all fell by double-digit percentages.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">One exception: Spending by the federal government <span id=""114"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 4.1 percent</span> as Congress moved to prevent deeper economic damage.</span> <span id=""58"" class=""red"">(That figure reflects only a small fraction of the government stimulus efforts, much of which are considered “transfer payments” that aren’t counted in gross domestic product.)

Stocks slid on Thursday as economic reports from the United States and Germany showed the toll of the coronavirus outbreak on growth, but a rally in shares of big technology companies, ahead of their earnings reports, helped minimize the blow to Wall Street.
</span><span id=""60"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""115"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 fell</span> about half a percent, while shares in Europe were down by more <span id=""116"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""61"" class=""red"">The Nasdaq composite climbed as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all rose.</span> <span id=""62"" class=""red"">The largest technology companies often set the direction of the broad market because of their sheer size.
</span><span id=""63"" class=""red"">Oil prices were also lower, as were shares of energy companies.</span> <span id=""64"" class=""red"">ConocoPhillips slid after the company said its earnings plunged by more than analysts had expected.
</span><span id=""65"" class=""red"">Financial stocks, closely tied to the cyclical ups and downs of the American economy, slumped too, as long-term interest rates — set by the yields on government bonds — continued to plumb some of the lowest levels in history.
</span><span id=""66"" class=""red"">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell <span id=""117"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.55 percent</span> on Thursday morning.</span> <span id=""67"" class=""red"">Such yields help set the price of the loans banks make and significantly influence their profitability.
</span><span id=""68"" class=""red"">The U.S. economy shrank <span id=""118"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 9.5 percent</span> in the second quarter, while Germany’s economy shrank <span id=""119"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 10.1 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""69"" class=""red"">On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, U.S. gross domestic product fell at a rate <span id=""82"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""120"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 32.9 percent</span></span>, which is the sharpest drop on record.
</span><span id=""70"" class=""red"">Data released at the same time showed <span id=""121"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 1.43 million</span> Americans filed new state unemployment claims, the second week in which that number has risen and a figure that highlights the persistence of the economic downturn.
</span>The grim data came a day after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, told reporters that the “pace of recovery looks like it has slowed,” pointing to debit and credit card spending and hiring trends. <span id=""71"" class=""red"">He added, “The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.”

Peacock, its new streaming product, <span id=""124"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""140"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">attracted 10 million</span></span> sign-ups in its first three months. <span id=""72"" class=""red"">It differs from other platforms like HBO Max (which <span id=""125"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">netted 4.1 million</span> in one month) and Netflix in that it is free and relies on advertising for revenue.</span> (There is a paid tier that features more content but still includes ads.) The strategy is reminiscent of the original broadcast system, which is also free. Comcast hopes to <span id=""126"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 35 million</span> users <span id=""127"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2024.</span>
With most of the country under lockdown, Comcast <span id=""128"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""141"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 323,000 more</span></span> broadband customers, but it <span id=""129"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""142"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 477,000 pay</span></span> TV subscribers. People switched to cheaper streaming alternatives as wallets tightened under the pandemic. <span id=""73"" class=""red"">It’s not a bad trade for Comcast, since a broadband subscriber tends to add more profit than a video one.
</span>At NBCUniversal, the lack of sports and the shutdown of movie theaters and theme parks hurt the division. <span id=""74"" class=""red"">Sales <span id=""130"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 25 percent</span> <span id=""131"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $6.1 billion</span>.</span> <span id=""75"" class=""red"">Theme parks took <span id=""132"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $399 million</span> loss for the quarter, and the Universal Studios division saw sales decline nearly a fifth <span id=""133"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.2 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""76"" class=""red"">But a significant deal was struck this week between Universal and AMC Entertainment, the nation’s largest theater chain, that could recast the economics of the film industry.</span> The studio can now sell movies on <span id=""134"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">streaming 17 days</span> after it runs in theaters, collapsing the usual 90-day window. Movies tend to make most of its box office dollars in the first two weekends, so the new terms appear to benefit the studio. In other words, there will be more reasons to stay home.
<span id=""77"" class=""red"">United Airlines warned its pilots on Thursday that it may need to expand planned furloughs if demand for flights remains deeply depressed and a vaccine is not mass produced by the end of next year.</span> The airline previously said that it could furlough up to one third of its pilots, <span id=""135"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 3,900 people</span>, this year and next. “That may not prove to be enough,” an executive said in a memo to pilots.
California Pizza Kitchen filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas on Thursday. <span id=""78"" class=""red"">The company, which operates more <span id=""136"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 locations</span> in the United States and internationally, said it will use the restructuring process to close unprofitable locations and cut debt, and plans to emerge from bankruptcy in under three months.</span> The company is the latest dining chain to file for <span id=""137"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 protection</span> during the pandemic, following Chuck E.

</span><span id=""83"" class=""red"">Volkswagen said on Thursday it fell into the red during the first six months <span id=""145"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020 after</span> sales <span id=""146"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">plunged 23 percent</span> compared to a year earlier.</span> <span id=""84"" class=""red"">But the world’s largest carmaker said vehicle sales, which were down by more than half in May, have begun to recover.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">It’s a wish list of economic help for low- and middle-income families:

· Lowering health-care premiums for millions of Americans who buy their health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

I want to believe change is coming. But we’ve been here before. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Grand plans made, then broken or stymied by a horribly partisan political system in which all too often policies favoring major corporations and special-interest groups trump the needs of the many.

</span>President Donald Trump made all kinds of promises about helping struggling Americans, too, in his first address to a joint session of Congress. Many of his plans were thwarted by the pandemic and a Congress so divided that members might struggle to agree the sky is blue on a sunny day.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Biden certainly said all the right things — about the need to increase the minimum wage and create jobs that could give people “a little breathing room.”</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But frankly, I’m concerned legislators are willing only to drop financial breadcrumbs to low- and middle-income households when an economic crisis hits.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Even at the depths of this coronavirus recession, many Senate Republicans were reluctant to endorse a big stimulus program — although it had Trump’s backing.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">We need long-term financial relief for people left further behind because of the pandemic.</span> Realistically, Biden’s got a short time before the next election cycle might take away the slight legislative leverage the Democrats wield in Congress.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the costs of inaction will further widen the economic divide.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a quarter of women say their family’s financial situation is worse today than before the coronavirus-related shutdowns.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Yes, the three rounds of stimulus payments made a huge difference, but just for a few weeks or months.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">When will we stop trying to solve systemic economic problems for low- and middle-income families with relief money that is given only begrudgingly — and then only because the powers that be fear it will upset Wall Street if they don’t.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">My Post colleague Allan Sloan wrote at the end of last year, “I think that many of the problems in our country stem from the division between the kind of people who benefit from government policies that support financial markets and stock prices, and the people short on financial assets who are left on their own to try to make a decent living and provide for their families at a time when inflation-adjusted wages have been eroding.”

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The Biden administration and many congressional Democrats want to increase the hourly minimum wage from a <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">measly $7.25 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $15 an</span> hour.

</span>It’s a popular proposal.

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults favor raising the federal minimum wage to<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $15 an</span> hour, according to a Pew Research Center survey in early April.</span> But there are sharp partisan differences, Pew said.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“Let’s raise the minimum wage <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $15,</span>” Biden said in his speech Wednesday night.</span> “... <span id=""19"" class=""red"">No one <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">working 40 hours</span> a week should live below the poverty line.”

68959,"<h3>Russia’s economy contracts sharply as war and sanctions take hold.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Daily Business Briefing
The Russian economy contracted steeply in the second quarter as the country felt the brunt of the economic consequences of its war in Ukraine, in what experts believe to be the start of a yearslong downturn.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The economy <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shrank 4 percent</span> from April through June compared with a year earlier, the Russian statistics agency said on Friday.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is the first quarterly gross domestic product report to fully capture the change in the economy since the invasion of Ukraine in February.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It was a sharp reversal from the first quarter, when the economy <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 3.5 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Western sanctions, which cut off Russia from about half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $600 billion</span> emergency stash of foreign currency and gold reserves, imposed steep restrictions on dealings with Russian banks and cut access to American technology, prompting hundreds of major Western corporations to pull out of the country.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">But even as imports to Russia dried up and financial transactions were blocked, forcing the country to default on its foreign debt, the Russian economy proved more resilient than some economists had initially expected, and the fall in G.D.P. reported on Friday was not as severe as some had expected in part because the country’s coffers were flush with energy revenue as global prices rose.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Russia’s economic growth since annexation of Crimea
Year-over-year change in quarterly G.D.P.
Analysts, though, say the economic toll will grow heavier as Western nations increasingly turn away from Russian oil and gas, critical sources of export revenue.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We thought it would be a deep dive this year and then even out,” Laura Solanko, a senior adviser at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, said of the Russian economy.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Instead, there has been a milder economic decline, but it will continue into next year, putting the economy in a shallower recession for two years, she said.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Russia, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.5 trillion</span> economy before the war started, moved quickly in the days after the invasion to mitigate the impact of sanctions.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The central bank more than doubled the interest rate <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span>, severely restricted the flow of money out of the country, shut down stock trading on the Moscow Exchange and loosened regulations on banks so lending didn’t seize up.</span> The government also increased social spending to support households and loans for businesses hurt by sanctions.
The measures blunted some of the sanctions’ impact. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">And as the ruble rebounded, Russia’s finances benefited from high oil prices.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">“Russia withstood the initial sanction shock” and “has been relatively resilient so far,” said Dmitry Dolgin, the chief economist covering Russia at the Dutch bank ING.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But, he noted, unless Russia manages to diversify its trade and finances, the economy will be weaker in the long term.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Retail trade declined <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span>, the statistics agency said, while wholesale business activity <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 15 percent</span>.
</span>Michael S. Bernstam, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said the data released on Friday were in line with other reports from Russia. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">He, too, expects the economy to deteriorate in the second half of this year, and then again <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023.</span>
</span>As the war drags on, many countries and companies will look to permanently end relationships with Russia and its domestic companies. Businesses will have trouble getting replacement parts for Western-made machines, and software will need updates. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Russian companies will need to rearrange their supply chains as imports seize up.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">The prospects for Russia’s energy industry, central to the country’s economy, are deteriorating.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The United States and Britain have already banned Russian oil imports, and the country’s oil output will fall further early next year when the full impact of a European Union ban on imports comes into effect.</span> Russia would need to find customers for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2.3 million</span> barrels of crude and oil products a day, which is <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> of its average output <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022,</span> according to the International Energy Agency.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">So far countries including India, China and Turkey have absorbed some of the lost trade from Europe and the United States, but it’s unclear how many new buyers can be found.
</span>Reliance on Russian natural gas is also being reduced. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">In the final week of June, total European Union gas imports from Russia were <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 65 percent</span> from a year earlier, according to a report by the European Central Bank.</span> Some of these declines were forced on Europe because Russia has been cutting its supplies of gas. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">But European countries have ramped up efforts to find alternative sources and are, for example, quickly developing infrastructure for additional imports of liquefied natural gas.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The economy will suffer as the “exhaustion of inventories of investment imports, enforcement of the E.U. oil embargo, higher financial pressure on households and their higher dependence on the state” take their toll, while the ability of the central bank and government to provide monetary and fiscal support is limited, Mr. Dolgin of ING wrote.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, inflation in Russia soared as households scrambled for goods they expected to become scarce.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">In July, inflation was running more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 percent</span>, according to the Russian central bank.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Already, though, there are signs inflation is slowing down, and as a result the central bank has slashed interest rates <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8 percent</span>, lower than they were before the war.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Last month, the bank said that business activity had not slowed as much as expected, but that the economic environment “remains challenging and continues to significantly constrain economic activity.”
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">The bank forecast that the economy will <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shrink 4 percent</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6 percent</span> this year, much less than it originally expected right after the start of the war.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">That 6 percent</span> figure also matches the latest update from the International Monetary Fund.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The economy will have a deeper contraction next year and not return to growth <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2025,</span> the central bank said on Friday.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The bank forecast that inflation would <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be 12 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 percent</span> by the end of the year.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">In coming months, supply chain issues will present challenges, as businesses constrained by sanctions try to alter their supply chains to replenish stockpiles of finished and raw goods.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">“I don’t think the Russian economy is doing well at the moment,” Ms. Solanko said.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">But the idea that sanctions and the departure of companies from Russia would cause the economy to rapidly collapse was never realistic.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“Economies just don’t vanish,” she said.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">S&<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 index</span>
The stock market is set to notch the year’s best stretch of gains, as investors take comfort from early signals that inflation is slowing down and the economy is holding up.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 rose</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1.5 percent</span> on Friday, putting the index on course for its fourth consecutive positive week, a feat it hasn’t achieved since October.</span> The index is now <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 15 percent</span> higher than its low point in June, though it remains more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> lower for the year.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">The rally stands in stark contrast to the first half of the year, when Wall Street suffered its worst start in half a century, as the war in Ukraine, soaring energy costs, rising interest rates and rapid inflation galvanized investors’ fears about the health of the economy.
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">In the past month, investors have welcomed data that showed cooling inflation, a robust labor market and resilient company earnings.</span> Having braced for the worst, improvements in the outlook are being met with relief.
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve officials have suggested that their campaign of interest rate increases to tame inflation is not yet done.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">But some investors see recent economic data as grounds for the central bank to move less aggressively, easing worries that higher borrowing costs could push the economy into a severe downturn.
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">“The peak of freaking out about inflation and interest rates is done and we are looking at something that is not quite as dramatic,” Michael Purves, the founder and chief executive of Tallbacken Capital, said.
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">The latest Consumer Price Index report, released on Wednesday, offered a moment of relief for Wall Street, as inflation slowed <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5 percent</span> for the year to July, down from <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 9.1 percent</span> pace in the previous month.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">The data offered an early indication that the Fed’s attempt to pull inflation down may be having an effect.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">What’s more, data showing that in July the economy regained all the jobs lost in the pandemic, along with weeks of better-than-expected earnings reports from companies, have assuaged some concern among investors that higher rates, which increase costs for companies, could cut more deeply into corporate America.
</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">The CBOE Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” because it reflects a sense of investors’ uncertainty over stock market moves, dipped below its long-term average <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 points</span> this week.</span> The Vix had stayed above that mark since April, so the lower reading could be a sign that investors’ consternation about another lurch lower has subsided.
<span id=""46"" class=""red"">“We’ve seen a succession of inflationary pressures begin to roll over,” said Patrick Palfrey, a senior US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, adding that this is “forcing” investors to re-evaluate their trading positions.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Bankers said that retail investors have helped drive the rally.</span> Sharp rises in so-called meme stocks and an uptick in some cryptocurrencies also point to great participation by individual investors.
<span id=""48"" class=""red"">“The cornerstone of this is the labor market and it’s rock solid,” James Masserio, the co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale, said.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">“If you don’t have a job then you are not buying meme stocks.”
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Experts also said that stock markets were primed to ratchet higher.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">Investors had scaled back their bets on the market because of uncertainty.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">The volume of trading has also been low, with many big investors taking vacations through August.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">As a result, even small amounts of buying interest have helped to lift the market, with momentum building as other investors chased returns.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Over $11 billion</span> flowed into funds that buy U.S. stocks in the week through Wednesday, according to EPFR Global, the most in eight weeks.
But some warned that just as quickly as markets have recovered, they could come unstuck. <span id=""54"" class=""red"">Short-term gains are not unusual during periods of protracted losses, known as bear market rallies.
</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">After the S&<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 peaked</span> in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2007,</span> it slid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 50 percent</span> to <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2008 in</span> the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse.</span> Then, the index rose by <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 24 percent</span> in a matter of weeks. But the sell-off was not over. <span id=""56"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 gave</span> up all of those gains in <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2009,</span> before bottoming out in March of that year.
</span><span id=""57"" class=""red"">Mr. Masserio said that the Fed’s task of lowering inflation back to its target <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 percent</span> was akin to turning an oil tanker around: slow and fraught with risk.
</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“Fundamentally, what had built up in the system is a lot trickier than what we can fix in six months of a shift in monetary policy,” he said, warning that the stock market’s woes may not yet be over.
</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">Stocks are higher because the inflation outlook has improved and the economic backdrop remains supportive.</span> While expectations are not as dour as they were, there are doubts about how long the rally can last.
<span id=""60"" class=""red"">“I am bullish on the market but I am still an anxious and nervous bull,” said Mr. Purves.</span> “We are not out of the woods just yet.”
<span id=""61"" class=""red"">Five of China’s biggest state-owned companies, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in market value, will delist from the New York Stock Exchange in coming weeks, the firms said in a flurry of filings on Friday.
</span>Three of the world’s biggest energy firms, PetroChina, Sinopec and Shanghai Petrochemical, said in separate statements that they would apply for a voluntary delisting of their American depositary shares. Two other state-owned giants, the insurer China Life and the aluminum producer Chalco, also said they would stop offering their shares in the United States, citing the administrative burden and costs related to maintaining the shares.
<span id=""62"" class=""red"">The companies’ share prices fell in early trading in New York on Friday, most by <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""63"" class=""red"">Together, the companies have a combined market valuation of more <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $300 billion</span>.
</span>They made their announcements amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, and greater scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the United States since Congress passed legislation introducing stricter oversight of these firms <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span></span></span>
<span id=""64"" class=""red"">American lawmakers have long complained that Chinese companies do not play by the same rules as other companies on U.S. stock exchanges.</span> Despite years of discussions, Beijing and Washington have failed to strike an agreement that would give American regulators access to fully inspect the audit papers of U.S.-listed Chinese businesses.
<span id=""65"" class=""red"">A listing on Wall Street, with its deep investor base and liquid market, was once seen as a coveted position for China’s biggest companies and an important step for those aspiring to go global.
</span><span id=""66"" class=""red"">But tensions between China and the United States have spilled over into nearly every aspect of the relationship between the two countries, from defense to climate and finance.</span> A contentious trip last week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own, has further inflamed the relationship. Hours after her visit, Beijing halted talks on military coordination, climate change and other issues.
<span id=""67"" class=""red"">China’s market regulator said the moves would not “jeopardize” fund-raising activities by the five firms, adding that they can choose from multiple markets.</span> The companies will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland China.
<span id=""68"" class=""red"">“These companies have strictly complied with the rules and regulatory requirements of the U.S. capital market since their listing in the U.S. and made the delisting choice for their own business considerations,” the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement on Friday.
</span>All five companies were added to a list of Chinese firms that did not meet the auditing standards of U.S. regulators, outlined in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that was passed <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span></span></span>
Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant listed in New York, is another firm that was recently added to the list of more <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 270 companies</span>. When news of its addition emerged this month, its U.S.-listed shares <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 11 percent</span>. The company said last month that it would soon seek a primary listing in Hong Kong, a move that would allow more investors from mainland China to invest in it.
<span id=""69"" class=""red"">Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber, was among the first Chinese companies to announce plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange late last year, signaling the end of a multiyear, trillion-dollar love affair between China and Wall Street.
</span><span id=""70"" class=""red"">The British economy contracted slightly in the second quarter, losing momentum as the country experiences a deepening cost-of-living crisis and economists predict that a recession will start later this year.
</span><span id=""71"" class=""red"">Gross domestic product <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 0.1 percent</span> in April to June compared with the previous quarter, when the economy <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 0.8 percent</span>, the Office for National Statistics reported on Friday.
</span>The biggest drag on growth in the second quarter was a reduction in health services as pandemic measures, such as coronavirus testing and vaccine administering, declined. <span id=""72"" class=""red"">This was only partly offset by growth in consumer-facing services, such as travel agencies, restaurants and hotels, and spending related to the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.
</span><span id=""73"" class=""red"">Britons are facing a bleak combination of stagnant or declining economic growth with one of the highest inflation rates among its rich-economy peers.</span> <span id=""74"" class=""red"">In June, inflation climbed <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9.4 percent</span>, the highest <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>, but isn’t expected to peak until it <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaches 13 percent</span> in October.</span> <span id=""75"" class=""red"">The Bank of England, which has been steadily raising interest rates since December in an effort to restrain rapid price rises, predicted last week that the country would enter a recession at the end of the year and wouldn’t exit it until the beginning <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2024.</span>
</span><span id=""76"" class=""red"">High inflation is squeezing household budgets and is expected to lead to a sharp decline in consumer spending, normally a major driver of economic growth, while soaring energy prices also constrain businesses.</span> <span id=""77"" class=""red"">Household incomes, adjusted for inflation and taxes, are predicted to fall sharply this year and next, in the worst decline in records dating back to the 1960s, the central bank said.

</span><span id=""83"" class=""red"">The lingering effects of the pandemic and the economic consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are evident in the British economy.</span> <span id=""84"" class=""red"">In the second quarter, growth was dragged down by a decline in wholesale and retail business activities, with companies reporting that they were still hampered by supply chain disruptions and a drop in retail sales as people cut back on spending to cope with the rising cost of living.

</span>SEOUL — President Yoon Suk-yeol on Friday pardoned Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of the Samsung conglomerate, who served prison time after being convicted of bribing one of Mr. Yoon’s predecessors.
Mr. Lee was released on parole last August. The pardon gives him a free hand to run Samsung, because it ends what had been a five-year ban on his return to management. <span id=""87"" class=""red"">But many South Korean business analysts believe that Mr. Lee had continued to control his empire through loyal subordinates, though Samsung has never explicitly confirmed that.
</span>Mr. Lee was one of <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1,700 people</span> pardoned by Mr. Yoon on Friday; most had been convicted of white-collar crimes and traffic violations. South Korean presidents often issue mass pardons to mark major holidays, like National Liberation Day, which falls on Monday, when the pardons will take effect.
<span id=""88"" class=""red"">“I hope that this special pardon will become an occasion for the people to pull their strength together to help overcome the economic crisis,” Mr. Yoon said during a cabinet meeting on Friday.</span> <span id=""89"" class=""red"">He said many small-business owners had been among those pardoned.
</span><span id=""90"" class=""red"">Samsung is the most successful of the handful of family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, that helped make South Korea a global export powerhouse and still dominate the economy.</span> <span id=""91"" class=""red"">Its Samsung Electronics unit alone accounts for nearly one-sixth of the country’s total exports.
</span>Mr. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, was convicted of bribing Park Geun-hye, the president at the time, to obtain government support for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries. Ms. Park was impeached <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 over</span> that bribe and other corruption accusations, and eventually went to prison herself, before being pardoned and released in December.
Mr. Lee was in the midst of a two-and-a-half-year prison term when he was paroled last year. <span id=""92"" class=""red"">Another tycoon, the Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin. received a suspended prison sentence on charges related to Ms. Park, and was also pardoned on Friday by Mr. Yoon, who promised a business-friendly government as a presidential candidate this year.
</span>Mr. Yoon, a former prosecutor, was a leading member of the investigative team whose work led to the conviction of Mr. Lee and Mr. Shin.
In South Korea, there is a long history of chaebol leaders who were convicted of graft-related crimes and later received presidential pardons, usually on the grounds that the country needed the leaders. Anticorruption activists have long argued that such pardons help to entrench corruption in South Korean politics.
An opposition lawmaker, Park Yong-jin, said on Friday that Mr. Yoon had confirmed the widely held belief that “you are free if you are rich, but guilty if poor.”
<span id=""93"" class=""red"">But business groups have tirelessly lobbied for such pardons, arguing that the economy benefits when chaebol leaders are free to run their empires.</span> Recent public surveys found that a majority of South Koreans supported a pardon for Mr. Lee. In recent days, Mr. Yoon’s approval ratings have dipped <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 30 percent</span>, an unusually poor performance for a South Korean leader so early in office.
Though Mr. Lee’s title is vice chairman, he began running South Korea’s biggest and most lucrative conglomerate <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 when</span> his father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung’s chairman, was incapacitated by a heart attack. The elder Mr. Lee died <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span></span></span>
“I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity to make a fresh start,” Mr. Lee said on Friday in a statement released through Samsung. <span id=""94"" class=""red"">“I will respond to the people’s expectations and the government’s thoughtful consideration by contributing to the economy through continuous investment and job creation for young people.”
</span><span id=""95"" class=""red"">South Korea has faced mounting uncertainty over its economy and national security, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, the growing tensions between the United States and China over Taiwan and North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapons threat.
</span><span id=""96"" class=""red"">South Korean news outlets said the pardon could encourage Mr. Lee to succeed his late father as chairman of Samsung and to deal more actively with challenges facing the company, at a time when the global chip industry is scrambling to address supply shortages caused in part by the Covid-19 pandemic.
</span><span id=""97"" class=""red"">Samsung, a global leader in the chip industry, must also deal with American pressure on South Korea to join a United States-led semiconductor supply chain alliance and with growing competition from China, which is investing aggressively in its own semiconductor industry.
</span>Mr. Lee’s legal troubles are not over. <span id=""98"" class=""red"">He is on trial on separate criminal charges of stock price manipulation and unfair trading.</span> Mr. Lee has said he is innocent.
Rivian, a fledgling electric-vehicle manufacturer, said Thursday that it <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost $1.7 billion</span> in the second quarter.
The company said it was continuing to struggle to get enough components to ramp up production to higher levels, but it affirmed its expectation that it would <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make 25,000 vehicles</span></span> by the end of the year.
<span id=""99"" class=""red"">“Supply chain continues to be the limiting factor of our production,” the company said in a statement.</span> “However, through close partnership with our suppliers we are making progress.”

Rivian said last month that it <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produced 4,401 vehicles</span> in the second quarter and <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">delivered 4,467 to</span> customers.
In a conference call, Rivian’s chief executive, R.J. Scaringe, said that the company was seeing improvement in component availability, and that it was optimistic it could increase output in the second half of the year.
<span id=""101"" class=""red"">“The second quarter saw a number of challenges in terms of semiconductors as well as overall ramping in our supply base,” he said.</span> “As we look out over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of confidence” about accelerating production.
The company plans a second shift of production by the end of the third quarter and has started hiring workers for it, Mr. Scaringe said.
Rivian said it expected a full-year adjusted loss <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.45 billion</span>, up from an earlier forecast <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $4.75 billion</span>. <span id=""102"" class=""red"">It attributed the increase to higher material and shipping costs stemming from inflation, and costs associated with increasing production.
</span>Rivian was once viewed as “the next Tesla,” an electric-vehicle maker poised to grow rapidly and unsettle century-old giants of the auto industry like Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen. It planned to make an electric pickup and sport utility vehicle — models that would set it apart from the minimalist electric cars that Tesla produces.
The company gained billions of dollars in backing from investors including Ford and Amazon, which announced it intended to <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 100,000 electric</span> delivery vans from Rivian.
<span id=""103"" class=""red"">Rivian’s initial public offering was the largest <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> and within a few days its stock price soared.</span> <span id=""104"" class=""red"">For a time, the company’s market value was greater than that of Ford and General Motors combined.
</span>But difficulty in sourcing critical computer chips and manufacturing troubles at its plant in Normal, Ill., kept production far below what the company had hoped for. It has also struggled to build delivery vans for Amazon. <span id=""105"" class=""red"">Rivian’s stock price plummeted, and investors remain concerned about the company’s prospects.
</span>Now, as production is climbing, it faces a tougher competitive landscape. <span id=""106"" class=""red"">Ford has started making an electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, which is likely to pass Rivian in sales by the end of the year.</span> <span id=""107"" class=""red"">Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai and several others have ramped up sales of electric S.U.V.s, and G.M. has said it will start selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and a pair of electric S.U.V.s next year.
</span><span id=""108"" class=""red"">Buyers of some of Rivian’s vehicles are also expected to soon lose access to a federal tax credit under the climate bill that the House is expected to approve on Friday; the Senate passed it on Sunday.</span> <span id=""109"" class=""red"">Under the bill, purchases of vans, S.U.V.s and pickups that sell for more <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $80,000 will</span> not qualify for tax credits.</span> The credits will also not be available to individuals or couples who earn more <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $150,000 or</span><span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $300,000 a</span> year.
<span id=""110"" class=""red"">Rivian said last month that it was laying off <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6 percent</span> of <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 11,500 employees</span>.</span> <span id=""111"" class=""red"">“To fully realize our potential, our strategy must support our sustainable growth as we ramp towards profitability,” Mr. Scaringe said in a letter to employees.</span> <span id=""112"" class=""red"">“We need to be able to continue to grow and scale without additional financing in this macro environment.”
</span>An earlier version of this article and its summary misstated Rivian’s production outlook for the full year. The company still expects to <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make 25,000 vehicles</span></span>; it did not increase the forecast.
Fox News has selected its chief legal correspondent and late-night news anchor, Shannon Bream, to be the host of its signature political talk show, “Fox News Sunday,” elevating a woman to the role for the first time in the program’s 26-year history.
<span id=""113"" class=""red"">The job has been vacant since late last year, when Chris Wallace suddenly left after growing increasingly unnerved by the reduction of down-the-middle political programming at the network.
</span>The show is something of an island in the Fox media world. Unlike the provocative conservative commentary served up in prime time on the Fox News Channel by hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, the content on “Fox News Sunday” is more neutral, modeled after the traditional Sunday morning news programs based in Washington. Democratic lawmakers regularly sit for lengthy interviews on the program, even though many are reluctant to do so during the channel’s weekday programming.
“Fox News Sunday” airs first on the Fox broadcast network and then later in the day on the cable news network.
Ms. Bream is known to Fox viewers for her reporting on legal issues and the Supreme Court and as the host of the midnight news program on Fox News, “Fox News @ Night.” Initially, the program was broadcast <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 p</span>.m. before the network bumped it for a comedy show hosted by Greg Gutfeld, who is also a co-host of “The Five,” a round-table talk show that skews to a conservative point of view. The move was part of a programming shift at Fox that left some of its news anchors and correspondents, including Mr. Wallace, feeling marginalized.
Ms. Bream is the latest of several women to be promoted to senior positions at Fox under its chief executive, Suzanne Scott, who was chosen to overhaul the network’s toxic workplace culture in the aftermath of a series of high-profile sexual harassment lawsuits involving Roger Ailes, the network’s founder. In recent years, Ms. Scott, who served as Fox News’s head of programming before being named chief executive <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> has installed Martha MacCallum, Dana Perino, Harris Faulkner and Laura Ingraham as hosts."
26853,"<h3>Giant Hedge Fund Bridgewater Flips View on China: ‘No Safe Places to Invest’</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Investment firm warns that recent stock gyrations will have broad, negative repercussions

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 22,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 9</span>:14 pm ET

The world’s biggest hedge fund has turned on the world’s fastest-growing economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Bridgewater Associates LP, one of Wall Street’s more outspoken bulls on China, told investors this week that the country’s recent stock-market rout will likely have broad, far-reaching repercussions.

</span>The fund’s executives once had been vocal advocates of China’s potential. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But that was before panic in the country’s stock markets shaved a third of the value off Shanghai’s main index, battering hordes of mom-and-pop investors and hedge funds alike, before partially rebounding.

</span>“Our views about China have changed,” Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Raymond Dalio, wrote with colleagues in a note sent to clients earlier this week. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“There are now no safe places to invest.”

Bridgewater, which <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has $169 billion</span> under management, is renowned for its ability to navigate global economic trends—including the profit it turned <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008,</span> when most of its peers lost big.</span> The company’s flagship fund reported its worst month in nearly a year in June, trimming its gains <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2015 to</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10%,</span> a person familiar with the matter said.

A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the fund’s changing views on China.

(Update: Bridgewater Issues Statement to ‘Clarify Their Thinking’)

The move adds Mr. Dalio and Bridgewater to a growing chorus of high-profile investors who are challenging the long-held view that China’s rise will provide a ballast to a whole host of investments, from commodities to bonds to shares in multinational firms. For a generation, bets on China’s rising middle class have been commonplace on Wall Street and beyond as investors have looked to diversify their holdings.

But with the country’s stocks on a roller-coaster ride this summer, those beliefs are being tested. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The world’s second-largest economy faces renewed questions about the sustainability of its growth and the government’s commitment to loosening its grip on the country’s heavily controlled markets.

</span>Kingdon Capital Management LLC, a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $3 billion</span> New York hedge-fund firm, told clients this week it had sold all its shares in Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It said it was spooked by the fallout from a surge in China in the use of borrowed money to purchase stocks, particularly after authorities cracked down on the practice, helping drag down Kingdon’s investments.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The firm said it would wait until the level of such borrowing in the market drops further before going in anew.

</span>The shifts by Kingdon and Bridgewater follow a series of concerns raised publicly last week about China by other high-profile hedge-fund managers, including Elliott Management Corp. founder Paul Singer, Perry Capital LLC founder Richard Perry and Pershing Square Capital Management LP founder William Ackman. In China, few traders dare cross regulators by publicly expressing their concerns.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It looks worse to me <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2007 in</span> the United States,” Mr. Ackman said during an investment conference in New York, pointing to the unreliability of the government’s economic statistics.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Much worse.”

Mr. Ackman has a long-running bet against nutritional-products maker Herbalife Ltd., partly based on his belief that the firm’s fast-growing Chinese business is illegal and part of a global pyramid scheme.

</span>Herbalife has denied the allegations.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The shifts are also a blow to Chinese leaders who have sought to woo international investors into their tightly controlled market.</span> Even before the selloff, global investors from hedge funds to big mutual-fund firms had been reluctant to invest directly in the country, despite the Chinese government’s efforts to make it easier for foreign investors to buy mainland-listed stocks, known as A-shares. Aggressive measures to stem the rout underscored concerns about China’s unpredictable government and lack of transparency, investors say.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Overseas investors have pulled cash out of Chinese stocks via a trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 of</span> the <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 13 trading</span> days, according to Hong Kong stock-exchange data.

</span>At its trough on <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 8,</span> the Shanghai Composite Index was <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">off 32% from</span> its June highs. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Even days after the market began to climb back, about half of <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2,800 stocks</span> listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets remained suspended from trading, though many have since resumed.

</span>The Shanghai Composite edged <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.2% Wednesday</span> but remains <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 22% from</span> its high in June. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The smaller Shenzhen market, where nearly a quarter of stocks remain suspended from trading, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1% Wednesday</span>.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock-market rout adds to a growing list of hurdles China faces.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">While its economy expanded at <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7% annual</span> rate in the second quarter—a level many economists thought would be hard to reach—many areas, such as building and infrastructure investment, showed weakness even after a succession of recent interest-rate cuts.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">China’s political leaders are also pushing to reduce the dependence of its slowing economy on export-driven growth and to lessen the heavy debt load of state-owned firms.

</span>Some big investors in the region still see a chance to pounce. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Eashwar Krishnan, who runs <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 billion</span> Hong Kong-based Tybourne Capital Management (HK) Ltd., said in a note to investors earlier this month that he has been heartened by regulators’ efforts to clean up the market and is “now looking through the rubble for other diamonds in the rough” to bolster Tybourne’s sole A-shares position.

Mr. Krishnan, formerly the Asia head of Lone Pine Capital LLC, had previously steered clear of Chinese shares as Shanghai stocks doubled in a year due to Mr. Krishnan’s concerns over what he called “clear” market manipulation and a worrying surge in individual investors borrowing money to buy stocks.</span> A firm spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The change by Bridgewater is a particularly sharp reversal. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Dalio has gone out of his way in the past to praise Chinese President Xi Jinping and has compared the country’s economic environment to a patient undergoing a heart transplant by a skilled surgeon.

</span>In a note to clients in June, Mr. Dalio said China’s problems “represent opportunities” because they give policy makers a chance to make positive reforms. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">As recently as earlier this month, Mr. Dalio wrote that the stock-market move was “not significantly reflective of, or influential on, the Chinese economy, Chinese investors, or foreign investors,” with the market still largely driven by a small pool of speculative investors in China.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">But this week, Mr. Dalio said he was particularly alarmed about the psychological damage of the stock-market decline.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">While prices remain above their levels from two years ago, many ordinary investors are sitting on losses because they piled in more recently, he said.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Even those who haven’t lost money in stocks will be affected psychologically by events, and those effects will have a depressive effect on economic activity,” Mr. Dalio wrote.

21481,"<h3>18 Revelations From a Trove of Trump Tax Records</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The New York Times has obtained tax-return data for President Trump and his companies that covers more than two decades.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump has long refused to release this information, making him the first president in decades to hide basic details about his finances.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His refusal has made his tax returns among the most sought-after documents in recent memory.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Among the key findings of The Times’s investigation:
Mr. Trump paid no federal income taxes <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 11 of</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 years</span> that The Times examined.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> after he became president, his tax bill was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $750.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">He has reduced his tax bill with questionable measures, including <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $72.9 million</span></span> tax refund that is the subject of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
</span>Many of his signature businesses, including his golf courses, report losing large amounts of money — losses that have helped him to lower his taxes.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The financial pressure on him is increasing as hundreds of millions of dollars in loans he personally guaranteed are soon coming due.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Even while declaring losses, he has managed to enjoy a lavish lifestyle by taking tax deductions on what most people would consider personal expenses, including residences, aircraft <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $70,000 in</span> hairstyling for television.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Ivanka Trump, while working as an employee of the Trump Organization, appears to have received “consulting fees” that also helped reduce the family’s tax bill.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">As president, he has received more money from foreign sources and U.S. interest groups than previously known.</span> The records do not reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It is important to remember that the returns are not an unvarnished look at Mr. Trump’s business activity.</span> They are instead his own portrayal of his companies, compiled for the I.R.S. But they do offer the most detailed picture yet available.
Below is a deeper look at the takeaways. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The main article based on the investigation contains much more information, as does a timeline of the president’s finances.</span> Dean Baquet, the executive editor, has written a note explaining why The Times is publishing these findings.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The president’s tax avoidance
Mr. Trump has paid no federal income taxes for much of the past two decades.
</span>In addition to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 11 years</span> in which he paid no taxes during the<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 years</span> examined by The Times, he paid <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $750 in</span> each of the two most recent years —<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 and</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017.</span>
He has managed to avoid taxes while enjoying the lifestyle of a billionaire — which he claims to be — while his companies cover the costs of what many would consider personal expenses.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">This tax avoidance sets him apart from most other affluent Americans.
</span>Taxes on wealthy Americans have declined sharply over the past few decades, and many use loopholes to reduce their taxes below the statutory rates. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But most affluent people still pay a lot of federal income tax.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the average federal income rate for the highest-<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning .001 percent</span> of tax filers — that is, the most affluent 1/100,000th slice of the population — <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 24.1 percent</span>, according to the I.R.S.
Over the past two decades, Mr. Trump has paid <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $400 million</span> less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">His tax avoidance also sets him apart from past presidents.
</span>Mr. Trump may be the wealthiest U.S. president in history. Yet he has often paid less in taxes than other recent presidents. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Barack Obama and George W. Bush each regularly paid more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $100,000 a</span> year — and sometimes much more — in federal income taxes while in office.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump, by contrast, is running a federal government to which he has contributed almost no income tax revenue in many years.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">A large refund has been crucial to his tax avoidance.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump did face large tax bills after the initial success of “The Apprentice” television show, but he erased most of these tax payments through a refund.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Combined, Mr. Trump initially paid <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost $95 million</span> in federal income taxes over the<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 years</span>.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">He later managed to recoup most of that money, with interest, by applying for and receiving <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $72.9 million</span></span> tax refund, starting <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span>
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">The refund reduced his total federal income tax bill <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2000 and</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 to</span></span> an annual average <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.4 million</span>.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">By comparison, the average American in the <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top .001 percent</span> of earners paid <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $25 million</span> in federal income taxes each year over the same span.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $72.9 million</span> refund has since become the subject of a long-running battle with the I.R.S.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">When applying for the refund, he cited a giant financial loss that may be related to the failure of his Atlantic City casinos.</span> Publicly, he also claimed that he had fully surrendered his stake in the casinos.
But the real story may be different from the one he told. Federal law holds that investors can claim a total loss on an investment, as Mr. Trump did, only if they receive nothing in return. Mr. Trump did appear to receive something in return:<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 percent</span> of the new casino company that formed when he renounced his stake.
<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> the I.R.S. began an audit reviewing the legitimacy of the refund. Almost a decade later, the case remains unresolved, for unknown reasons, and could ultimately end up in federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Business expenses and personal benefits
Mr. Trump classifies much of the spending on his personal lifestyle as the cost of business.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">His residences are part of the family business, as are the golf courses where he spends so much time.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">He has classified the cost of his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his homes, as a business expense as well.</span> Haircuts — including more <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $70,000 to</span> style his hair during “The Apprentice” — have fallen into the same category. So did <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost $100,000 paid</span> to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">All of this helps to reduce Mr. Trump’s tax bill further, because companies can write off business expenses.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Seven Springs, his estate in Westchester County, N.Y., typifies his aggressive definition of business expenses.
</span>Mr. Trump bought the estate, which stretches over more <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 acres</span> in Bedford, N.Y., <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996.</span> His sons Eric and Donald Jr. spent summers living there when they were younger. “This is really our compound,” Eric told Forbes <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> “Today,” the Trump Organization website continues to report, “Seven Springs is used as a retreat for the Trump family.”
Nonetheless, the elder Mr. Trump has classified the estate as an investment property, distinct from a personal residence. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">As a result, he has been able to write <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">off $2.2 million</span> in property taxes <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2014 </span>— even as <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2017 tax</span> law has limited individuals to writing off <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $10,000 in</span> property taxes a year.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">The ‘consulting fees’
Across nearly all of his projects, Mr. Trump’s companies set aside <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> of income for unexplained ‘consulting fees.’
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">These fees reduce taxes, because companies are able to write them off as a business expense, lowering the amount of final profit subject to tax.
</span>Mr. Trump <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collected $5 million</span> on a hotel deal in Azerbaijan, for example, and <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reported $1.1 million</span> in consulting fees. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">In Dubai, there was <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $630,000 fee</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $3 million</span> in income.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2010,</span> Mr. Trump has written off <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some $26 million</span> in such fees.
His daughter appears to have received some of these consulting fees, despite having been a top Trump Organization executive.
The Times investigation discovered a striking match: Mr. Trump’s private records show that his company once <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $747,622 in</span> fees to an unnamed consultant for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia. Ivanka Trump’s public disclosure forms — which she filed when joining the White House staff <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span>— show that she had received an identical amount through a consulting company she co-owned.
Money-losing businesses
Many of the highest-profile Trump businesses lose large amounts of money.
<span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> he has reported losing more <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $315 million</span> at the golf courses that he often describes as the heart of his empire. Much of this has been at Trump National Doral, a resort near Miami that he bought <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> And his Washington hotel, opened <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> has lost more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $55 million</span>.
An exception: Trump Tower in New York, which reliably earns him more <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $20 million</span> in profits a year.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">The most successful part of the Trump business has been his personal brand.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">The Times calculates that <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2004 and</span><span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> Mr. Trump made a <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined $427.4 million</span> from selling his image — an image of unapologetic wealth through shrewd business management.</span> The marketing of this image has been a huge success, even if the underlying management of many of the operating Trump companies has not been.
Other firms, especially in real estate, have paid for the right to use the Trump name. The brand made possible the “The Apprentice” — and the show then took the image to another level.
Of course, Mr. Trump’s brand also made possible his election as the first United States president with no prior government experience.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">But his unprofitable companies still served a financial purpose: reducing his tax bill.
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">The Trump Organization — a collection of more <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 entities</span>, virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump — has used the losses to offset the rich profits from the licensing of the Trump brand and other profitable pieces of its business.
</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">The reported losses from the operating businesses were so large that they often fully erased the licensing income, leaving the organization to claim that it earns no money and thus owes no taxes.</span> This pattern is an old one for Mr. Trump. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">The collapse of major parts of his business in the early 1990s generated huge losses that he used to reduce his taxes for years afterward.
</span>Large bills looming
With the cash from ‘The Apprentice,’ Mr. Trump went on his biggest buying spree since the 1980s.
“The Apprentice,” which debuted on NBC <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> was a huge hit. Mr. Trump <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received 50 percent</span> of its profits, and he went on to buy more <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 golf</span> courses and multiple other properties. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">The losses at these properties reduced his tax bill.
</span>But the strategy ran into trouble as the money from “The Apprentice” began to decline. <span id=""42"" class=""red""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 2015,</span> his financial condition was worsening.
</span><span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">His 2016 presidential</span> campaign may have been partly an attempt to resuscitate his brand.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">The financial records do not answer this question definitively.</span> But the timing is consistent: Mr. Trump announced a campaign that seemed a long shot to win, but was almost certain to bring him newfound attention, at the same time that his businesses were in need of a new approach.
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">The presidency has helped his business.
</span>Since he became a leading presidential candidate, he has received large amounts of money from lobbyists, politicians and foreign officials who pay to stay at his properties or join his clubs. The Times investigation puts precise numbers on this spending for the first time.
<span id=""45"" class=""red"">A surge of new members at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida gave him an <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 million</span> a year from the business <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2015.</span></span> The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $397,602 in</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 to</span></span> the Washington hotel, where it held at least one event during its World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians.
In his first two years in the White House, Mr. Trump received millions of dollars from projects in foreign countries, <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $3 million</span> from the Philippines,<span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2.3 million</span> from India <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $1 million</span> from Turkey.
<span id=""46"" class=""red"">But the presidency has not resolved his core financial problem: Many of his businesses continue to lose money.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">With “The Apprentice” revenue declining, Mr. Trump has absorbed the losses partly through one-time financial moves that may not be available to him again.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red""><span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2012,</span> he took out <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100 million</span> mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">He has also sold hundreds of millions worth of stock and bonds.</span> <span id=""50"" class=""red"">But his financial records indicate that he may have as little <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $873,000 left</span> to sell.
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">He will soon face several major bills that could put further pressure on his finances.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">He appears to have paid off none of the principal of the Trump Tower mortgage, and the <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">full $100 million</span> comes due <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span></span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">And if he loses his dispute with the I.R.S. over <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 refund</span>, he could owe the government more <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $100 million</span> (including interest on the original amount).
</span>He is personally on the hook for some of these bills.
In the 1990s, Mr. Trump nearly ruined himself by personally guaranteeing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, and he has since said that he regretted doing so. <span id=""54"" class=""red"">But he has taken the same step again, his tax records show.</span> He appears to be responsible for loans <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $421 million</span>, most of which is coming due within four years.
Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president. Whether he wins or loses, he will probably need to find new ways to use his brand — and his popularity among tens of millions of Americans — to make money."

States can allocate some of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $10 billion</span></span> in federal funding for struggling homeowners to help people who bought their residences with nontraditional home loans, according to Treasury Department officials.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Guidance issued on Monday for the new Homeowners Assistance Fund allows states to provide financial aid to qualified residents who face foreclosure on a loan for a mobile home or a home acquired through a contract for deed — a loan financed by the seller of the property.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Some elderly residents who have taken out a reverse mortgage on their homes — a deal in which borrowers can get cash for the equity in their house — may also qualify for the emergency assistance money.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Advocates and some state governments had prodded the Treasury Department to extend the program’s support to those who do not have traditional mortgages.</span> A handful of states, including Texas and New York, drew up preliminary plans that would allow them to allocate some of the money in the Homeowners Assistance Fund to those with mobile homes or houses acquired through contracts for deed, which are sometimes called land contracts.
Such homeowners are among the most vulnerable because they can be easily foreclosed on or evicted after they miss just a few payments. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And these borrowers, who typically have poor credit ratings, tend to pay higher-than-normal interest rates on the loans they take out to acquire their residences.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $10 billion</span></span> allocated to the Homeowners Assistance Fund was included in the American Rescue Plan, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.9 trillion</span> measure enacted by Congress and the Biden administration to help keep Americans “experiencing hardships associated with the pandemic” in their homes. The money is being allocated to states, Native American tribes and U.S. territories.
The Homeowners Assistance Fund is separate from <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $47 billion</span> that the federal government is giving to states to provide rental assistance to tenants facing eviction and that was also included in the American Rescue Plan.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The tide has begun to turn on corporate vaccine mandates, with large employers including the Walt Disney Company, Facebook, Google and Walmart introducing stricter requirements for employees returning to the workplace.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But the policies come with some important caveats as executives juggle public health, labor relations and the bottom line, the DealBook newsletter reports.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">So far, with the exception of the health care industry, corporate vaccine mandates tend to cover the white-collar workers whom executives want back in the office, not the lower-income workers on the front lines who are less likely to be vaccinated.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Walmart’s vaccination mandate, for example, doesn’t cover the company’s most vulnerable employees: workers at its stores and warehouses.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The retailer, the biggest private employer in the United States, announced mandatory inoculation for employees at its headquarters and for managers who travel domestically.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">For a sense of scale, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 17,000 of</span> Walmart’<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 1.6 million</span> employees are expected to work in new headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One fear that companies have with broad vaccine mandates is that they could drive away employees when workers are already in short supply, especially in industries like retail and restaurants.</span> At the same time, not requiring vaccines may make other groups of workers anxious and more likely to quit.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">“For Walmart, they have to weigh, I think, which is a real concern about turnover, what the reputation would be to the frontline workers, against the value that they could parlay this into saying, ‘We’re a leader in public health now as a big employer,’” said Peter Berg, a professor of employment relations at Michigan State University.
</span>“From Walmart’s calculus, they may say, ‘Well, it’s really not going to benefit us that much as an organization to do this,’” he added.
For other companies, like airlines, negotiating mandates with unions, which are themselves mixed on the issue, adds complexity. As part of a deal reached in May between United Airlines and its union, the Air Line Pilots Association, for example, vaccinations will not be mandatory for pilots. But a deal agreed to among Hollywood’s major unions will allow studios to require everyone on a production set to be vaccinated.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“If you look at the divide of who is not vaccinated, it is people of lower income, it is people who are less likely to be insured, it is people in the states that reflect the politicization of the pandemic,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice dean for population health and health equity at the University of California, San Francisco.
</span>Companies that adopt partial mandates that “further widen” that gap, she said, would “only go so far” in achieving what the vaccination drives were meant to accomplish.

As the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, Google and Apple have copied each other’s smartphone software for years. Now Google has taken a page from Apple’s hardware playbook: The search giant has designed the computing chip powering its latest phones.
On Monday, Google unveiled its <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Pixel 6 phones</span></span>, the first to include its custom chips, which are called Tensor. The Tensor chip will enable the phones to rapidly perform complex computing tasks, the company said.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Google’s Android mobile operating system is by far the most widely used in the world, but its Pixel sales are dwarfed by those of Apple smartphones.</span> A major disadvantage for Google has been its approach to hardware: Because it relied on third parties for mobile chips, it couldn’t make its phones as zippy as competitors that designed their chips in house.
<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> Apple acquired P.A. Semi to design the mobile processors that would eventually power its iPhones and iPads.
Now Google, with its own chip design, has embedded the most complex and frequently used algorithms, like voice transcriptions and advanced photography effects, into the processor to improve speeds, said Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of devices and services. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That could give the Pixel a boost to compete with Apple and Samsung, which dominate the high-end phone market.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Google’s goal of a successful phone business has been expensive and rocky.</span> After acquiring Motorola Mobility <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $12.5 billion</span> a decade ago and failing to sell a hit phone, Google sold the company three years later to Lenovo for <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 billion</span>. <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Google closed <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.1 billion</span> deal to acquire most of HTC’s smartphone design unit, with more than<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span>000 HTC engineers moving to Google.
Google’s investment in its in-house chip will lead to higher costs for consumers. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Prices will be announced when the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Pixel 6 phones</span></span> are released this fall, Mr. Osterloh said, but he confirmed that the premium model, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Pixel 6 Pro</span>, was expected to surpass the cost of last year’s <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Pixel 5,</span> which started <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $700.</span>
</span>With the coronavirus spreading across the country and hospitalizations rising again, and public health officials warning that the Delta variant carries new risks even for vaccinated people, big businesses are rethinking their plans.
Some are delaying their plans to bring workers back to the office, and others are restoring mask requirements for customers. In the last week, several have also imposed vaccine mandates, after having held off on such a step for months.
The decision to require vaccines was endorsed on Sunday by the director of the National Institutes of Health. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Dr. Francis Collins said that asking employees for proof of vaccination or regular testing were steps “in the right direction.”
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Here’s how some big businesses changed their plans in late July:
Delayed return to office:
Lyft pushed back its return-to-office date to February from September, Google extended its work-from-home policy to mid-October, and Apple said employees would not be expected to return to the office until at least Oct.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> a month later than before.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Uber said that it would not require employees to return until Oct.<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span> instead of its initial September date, and that a further delay was possible if cases kept rising.
</span>Twitter shut its San Francisco and New York offices, putting a halt to reopening plans without a timeline in place.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">The New York Times Company also indefinitely postponed its planned return to the office, telling employees that they would be given four weeks notice before being expected to return.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company, which employs <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 4,700 people</span>, had planned for workers to start to return for at least three days a week in September.</span> Its offices will remain open for those who want to go in voluntarily, with proof of vaccination.
Endeavor, the parent company of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, closed its recently reopened offices after Los Angeles County reimposed its indoor mask mandate. An Endeavor spokesman said the company had decided that enforcement would be too difficult and would hinder group meetings.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Vaccine requirements:
Equinox, the luxury fitness company that includes SoulCycle, said on Monday that its members and employees must show one-time proof of vaccination — a physical immunization card, a photo of an immunization card or a digital vaccine card — to enter Equinox clubs, SoulCycle studios or corporate offices, starting in New York in September.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, with <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1.6 million</span> workers, said vaccines would be mandatory for employees in its headquarters and for managers who traveled in the United States.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The mandate does not apply to much of its work force — employees in stores, clubs, and distribution and fulfillment centers.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">The Walt Disney Company said salaried and nonunion hourly U.S. employees at its sites must be fully vaccinated.</span> Unvaccinated workers who are already on site will <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 60 days</span> to get the immunization, and new hires will be required to be fully vaccinated before starting work.
Masks requirements:
Home Depot said all its associates, contractors and vendors will be required to wear a mask in its stores, distribution centers and offices and at the homes and businesses of customers. Customers will also be asked to wear masks. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Lowe’s also said it would require masks of its employees, regardless of vaccination status.
</span>Walmart said it was reinstating mask requirements for associates in areas of the country with substantial or high transmission rates. The company recommended that customers wear masks in those areas, too. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The retailer also doubled its reward to employees who get vaccinated <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $75 to</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $150.</span>
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Starting Monday, the Florida-based grocery chain Publix will require employees to wear masks in all its stores regardless of their vaccination status.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Apple said employees and customers would have to wear masks regardless of their vaccination status in more than half its stores in the United States.</span> Apple said the stores would be determined by the rate of coronavirus cases in the area. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Apple also told its employees that they would have to wear masks when inside the company’s main offices in the United States, regardless of whether they were vaccinated.
</span>To understand work culture in China, start with a number:<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 996.</span>
It’s shorthand for the grueling schedule that has become the norm at many Chinese firms:<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9 a</span>.m. <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9 p</span>.m., six days a week.
The term originated in the technology sector about five years ago, when the country’s nascent internet companies were racing to compete with Silicon Valley. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">At first, workers were willing to trade their free time for overtime pay and the promise of helping China match the West.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">China’s economy has grown into the second-largest in the world, after that of the United States.</span> Tech behemoths like Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are household names. But recently, more tech workers are resisting the at-all-costs culture, Vivian Wang writes for The Morning newsletter.
Some in China’s working class dismiss the complaints as elite griping; after all, tech workers are highly paid and educated. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">But the debate also offers a window into the country’s economy more broadly, and the expectations of its young people.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">The first major pushback <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 996 came</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> as China’s economic growth slowed and tech workers began questioning their work conditions.</span> Online protests followed, but the movement faded under government censorship.
This year,<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 996 shot</span> back into the news after two workers died at Pinduoduo, an e-commerce giant. Since then, some companies have taken steps to improve work-life balance.
The pushback <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 996 also</span> reflects the hopes and anxieties of China’s young people.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Many are willing to endure the working conditions because of the competitiveness of the job market.</span> The number of college graduates in China rose <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 73 percent</span> in the past decade, a stunning achievement for a country that had fewer <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3.5 million</span> university students <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">As a result, more people are competing for a limited pool of white-collar jobs.
</span>But it’s also clear that many are sick of the rat race. Some Gen Zers have turned to reading Mao Zedong’s writings on communism to rage against capitalist exploitation. An online trend this year called on young people to “tangping,” or “lie flat” — essentially, to opt out.
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">The Chinese Communist Party sees the burnout and the threat it poses to economic growth.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">On the one hand, it has promised to better support college graduates in their job hunt.</span> But it has also censored discussions of tangping.
What began as a conversation about tech companies’ treatment of elite workers has expanded to include lower-skilled workers, especially gig laborers.
Middle-class Chinese people have increasingly shown solidarity with those workers. Last year, when package couriers went on strike before a major shopping holiday, many on social media cheered them on.

Square announced on Sunday <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $29 billion</span>, all-stock deal to buy Afterpay, an Australian specialist in the “buy now, pay later” sector.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">The financial technology firms described the deal as a way to take on the traditional banking industry by building out an alternative to credit cards.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">Square plans to incorporate Afterpay’s service, which allows users to stagger the cost of their purchases over interest-free installments, to its payment platforms that serve U.S. consumers and millions of small businesses.</span> Square is run by Jack Dorsey, who also heads Twitter.
Square’s Cash App, a payment platform with more <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 70 million</span> customers, has been a key point of growth for the company, particularly during the pandemic as customers have sought out cash-free options. Afterpay works with more <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 16 million</span> consumers and <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 100,000 merchants</span> globally.
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Installment plans were traditionally for low-income people, but the latest iteration serves online shoppers who may simply have a distrust of credit, a remnant of <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">(Consumer advocates have said the potential risks of the nascent service are not yet fully understood.)</span> The industry has benefited from the pandemic boom in e-commerce, and could cover as much <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1 trillion</span> in payment volume in a few years. Other players in the fast-growing sector include Affirm, Klarna, QuadPay and Sezzle.
<span id=""46"" class=""red"">Square also reported its second-quarter earnings on Sunday and said it <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had $4.7 billion</span> in revenue in the quarter, more than double the total from a year earlier.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">Its share price has risen more <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 percent</span> this year.
</span>The deal between Square and Afterpay requires shareholder and regulatory approval. Another big fintech deal, <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5.3 billion</span> takeover of Plaid by Visa, was called off in January after the Justice Department sued to block it, and the Biden administration has pledged to take a tough stance on corporate consolidation. <span id=""48"" class=""red"">When asked about potential antitrust concerns, Amrita Ahuja, Square’s chief financial officer, said the “buy now, pay later” industry was still “highly competitive.”

</span>YouTube has suspended the conservative news channel Sky News Australia for a week for breaching the platform’s coronavirus misinformation policy.
The broadcaster, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and has nearly two million subscribers on YouTube, is not allowed to upload new videos for the duration of its suspension, which began on Thursday. Existing videos on its account can still be viewed.
In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, YouTube said it had removed Sky News videos and issued a strike against the broadcaster in accordance with policies “to prevent the spread of coronavirus information that could cause real-world harm.”
This is the first strike for Sky News. If it receives three strikes <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 90 days</span>, its YouTube channel will be permanently deleted.
The statement did not specify what content was removed.
Sky News said in a statement on its website on Sunday that the suspension had resulted from “a review of old videos published to the channel,” and that it “acknowledges YouTube’s right to enforce its policies.”
An opinion piece published by Sky News on Sunday criticized the suspension as an “assault on freedom of thought” and said that some of the removed videos had featured debates over the efficacy of masks and lockdowns.
Lockdowns have been a contentious topic in Australia, where two of the largest cities are under stay-at-home orders amid growing clusters of the more contagious Delta variant of the virus. Brisbane began a three-day lockdown on Saturday after six cases were discovered, and on Monday it was extended until Sunday. In Sydney, where an outbreak of the Delta variant has grown to more <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3,500 cases</span>,<span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 300 soldiers</span> are patrolling the streets to enforce a lockdown that is in its sixth week.
Officials say the lockdowns are necessary because not enough Australians have been inoculated against Covid-19. <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 15 percent</span> of the population is fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database.
The Sky News suspension came on the same day it was reported that The Daily Telegraph, a Sydney tabloid that is also owned by News Corporation, had dropped a weekly column by the Sky News commentator Alan Jones.
In a segment on his Sky News show last month, Mr. Jones and Craig Kelly, an Australian lawmaker and conspiracy theorist, falsely claimed that the Delta variant was less deadly than the original form of the coronavirus and that people who had been vaccinated were more likely to die from the virus. Sky News subsequently retracted the segment and issued a correction.
A last-minute lobbying push by the cryptocurrency industry to change language in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was finalized over the weekend succeeded in scaling back some of the scrutiny that participants in the sector will face from the I.R.S.
The final legislative text included some changes to alleviate concerns of the cryptocurrency industry, which expressed alarm last week about new requirements that would define most of the participants in the sector as brokers and force them to turn over information to the I.R.S. The provision was projected to <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raise $28 billion</span> over a decade.
After receiving pushback from cryptocurrency lobbyists, lawmakers revised that section of the bill to “clarify” the definition of a broker rather than expand upon it.
The legislation also removed language that explicitly targeted “any decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.” It replaced that with a broader definition that characterizes brokers as anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.”
<span id=""75"" class=""red"">The cryptocurrency industry has been adamant that the tougher tax enforcement should not apply to miners, or creators, of digital money, or the “node operators” that keep the software behind transactions moving.
</span>Lobbyists were continuing to press senators for greater clarity to ensure that those parts of the nascent sector would be excluded from the law. <span id=""76"" class=""red"">They believe that they have assurances from top lawmakers, such as Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, about the intent of the law, but they are still seeking similar assurances from the Treasury Department, which will have broad discretion to implement the law if it is passed and signed by President Biden.</span>"
334,"<h3>Health-care exchange sign-ups fall far short of forecasts</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Enrollment in the insurance exchanges for President Obama’s signature health-care law is at less than half the initial forecast, pushing several major insurance companies to stop offering health plans in certain markets because of significant financial losses.
</span>As a result, the administration’s promise of a menu of health-plan choices has been replaced by a grim, though preliminary, forecast: Next year, more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 in</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 counties</span> are at risk of having a single insurer on its exchange, said Cynthia Cox, who studies health reform for the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Debate over how perilous the predicament is for the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, is nearly as partisan as the divide over the law itself. But at the root of the problem is this: The success of the law depends fundamentally on the exchanges being profitable for insurers — and that requires more people to sign up.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2013,</span> the Congressional Budget Office predicted <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 24 million</span> people would buy health coverage through the federally and state-operated online exchanges by this year.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Just 11.1 million</span> people were signed up as of late March.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Exchanges are marketplaces where people who do not receive health benefits through a job can buy private insurance, often with government subsidies.
</span>“Enrollment is key, first and foremost,” said Sara R. Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan foundation that funds health-care research. “They have to have this critical mass of people so that, by the law of averages, you’re going to get a mix of healthy and less healthy people.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">A big reason the CBO projections were so far off is that the agency overestimated how many people would lose insurance through their employers, which would force them into the exchanges.</span> But there have been challenges getting the uninsured to sign up, too.
The law requires every American to get health coverage or pay a penalty, but the penalty hasn’t been high enough to persuade many Americans to buy into the health plans. Even those who qualify for subsidized premiums sometimes balk at the high deductibles on some plans.
And people who do outreach to the uninsured say the enrollment process itself has been more complex and confusing than Obama’s initial comparison to buying a plane ticket.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“This exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health-care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that’s best for you and your family,” Obama said in a speech <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span></span> “You will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">In some markets, a shortfall in enrollment is testing insurers’ ability to balance the medical claims they pay out with income from premiums.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">In an announcement curtailing its involvement in the exchanges this month, Aetna cited financial losses traced to too many sick people signing up for care and not enough healthy ones.
</span>The health-care law has been a political lightning rod from the beginning, and Republican legislators have used insurance companies’ withdrawals from the exchanges to reignite calls for the law’s repeal.
Kaiser tracks public data on insurer participation in the exchanges to project how many options counties will have, but the numbers are not final. This year, exchanges in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span> of counties had just one insurer. Earlier this month, Aetna announced that it will pull out <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 11 of</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 15 states</span> where it offers coverage on the health-care exchanges. Humana made a similar decision weeks earlier, planning to exit several states. And last spring, UnitedHealth Group said it would remain in three or fewer exchanges next year.
Obama has used the health-care law’s challenges to issue a new call for a public insurance option.
“Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited,” he wrote in an essay published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Adding a public plan in such areas would strengthen the Marketplace approach, giving consumers more affordable options while also creating savings for the federal government.”
Chicago resident Eva Saur,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> is exactly the kind of healthy person insurers would like to have on their rolls. Saur hasn’t had coverage in nearly a decade, but she takes good care of her health. For the handful of times she’s been sick, a walk-in clinic at a pharmacy has been sufficient.
“I was raised — not against the system — but we had a doctor who would prescribe us herbs before a prescription” medication, Saur said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“For me, monetarily, it makes way more sense to do this.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Saur’s tax penalty for being uninsured was a bit more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600 last</span> year, while the cheapest health plan she examined cost about as much for three months in premiums — and came with <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $7,000 deductible</span>.
</span>The penalty for not signing up is increasing. Still, some policy experts insist it is not enough motivation to buy insurance.
“It was basically no stick at all. This is the classic case of where Johnny marked crayon on the wall, his mother said, ‘Don’t do that,’ and then slapped his hand a day later,” said Joseph Antos, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “The connection between the offense and the penalty is a little remote.”
The health-care law has had unequivocal successes. In some areas, lots of insurers compete on the exchanges, which helps keep premiums low. In Cleveland and Los Angeles, the average premium for a benchmark health plan actually declined <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> The number of uninsured Americans continues to shrink, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hitting 9.1 percent</span> last year — the lowest level ever.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The average premium for the people who receive tax credits –<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 85 percent</span> of the people signed up through the exchanges — is <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $106 per</span> month.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">People who qualify for the income-based tax credits are largely sheltered from premium increases.
</span>The first people to sign up for insurance through the exchanges were expected to be those with chronic diseases and high medical costs. Because insurers could no longer discriminate against those people, the law built in three mechanisms for the government to redistribute money from plans with healthier patients to those with sicker ones. Two of those programs expire at the end of the year. The third, called the “risk adjustment” program, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">transferred $4.6 billion</span> between insurers <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
Critics say there’s a fundamental problem with the system, and the risk-adjustment program needs to be fixed. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But supporters of the law argue that the problem is temporary, the natural evolution of a nascent free-market system.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of the first companies to enter the market made bad bets on how healthy customers would be, resulting in unprofitable health plans.</span> Proponents say it’s natural for new entrants to replace them, with better information and more competitive plans.
Cigna, for example, has said it has filed to enter exchanges in three new states next year.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">“There’s no bottleneck, this is just the natural growth pains of a new market,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“What happened is they set up this new market where insurers didn’t have experience; insurers made an estimate as to what people would cost and their estimate turned out to be too low.”
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Supporters point to a recent government analysis that suggests the “risk pool” — the number of high-cost sick customers relative to healthy ones — is not worsening and could even be improving.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Medical costs per enrollee in the marketplaces fell <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.1 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> while medical costs for people in the broader health-insurance market grew by at <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 3 percent</span>.</span> In states with strong enrollment growth, there were greater reductions in members’ costs.
Everyone agrees that more healthy people need to sign up.
In June, the Obama administration unveiled its plan to target younger and healthier adults, including direct outreach to individuals and families who paid the penalty. It also released new guidance, encouraging insurance companies to communicate more with young adults being kicked off their family’s plan when they <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">turn 26 years</span> old.
Even older adults are taking their chances without health-care coverage.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Donte Fitzhugh,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> of Charlotte was laid off last year from a job as a call-center operations manager.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">COBRA, which allows former workers to extend their employer-provided health insurance if they pay the full premium, was expensive, and Fitzhugh didn’t sign up for the exchanges for very human reasons: He figured he’d find a job faster than he did.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">He thought every penny counted when he was unemployed.</span> He didn’t have major health problems, and he got a coupon to help cover the costs of his hypertension medicine.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As the window to sign up for health insurance passed without a new job, he kept procrastinating.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Although health insurance from a new job will begin in October, he faces a penalty that will cost him hundreds of dollars.
</span>“I believe in Obamacare. As an American, it’s my responsibility to have health insurance,” Fitzhugh said. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Since I didn’t have it, it’s going to impact me financially.”
</span>Such are the barriers to insurance: Remaining uninsured can be more attractive or just easier than signing up to pay hundreds of dollars a month for something that many people don’t think they need.
Judy Robinson, a health insurance support specialist at the Charlottesville Free Clinic, has counseled hundreds of patients who are eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchanges but ultimately decide not to sign up. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">She said the subsidized insurance on the marketplace tends to be a good deal for those who make <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 100 and</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 150 percent</span> of the poverty level.</span> But those who make more often are faced with large deductibles that don’t seem like a good deal to many people.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Beyond the sticker price, she said it can require a lot of paperwork to demonstrate the annual income required to qualify for tax credits if people are juggling multiple part-time jobs.</span> And sometimes, people are simply mistrustful.
“There’s a lot of people that live sort of off the grid, sort of semi-off the grid and they just don’t go to the doctor,” Robinson said. “The hospital is the place where you go to die, and doctors are just going to try and make you do procedures and get money out of you. That’s how they think.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">There are also those who want insurance but are struggling — and find themselves trapped by the high cost of health care.
</span>Donna Privigyi,<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span> of Charlottesville has looked into insurance through the exchanges a few times. But over the past few years, much of her modest child-care salary and effort went toward trying to help support her adult son, Mark, who hadn’t been the same since the death of his younger brother. Donna was focused on trying to support her son. Health insurance — even rent — was an afterthought.
“With supporting my son, it didn’t matter,” Privigyi said. “I was just like, I can barely get by, just juggling the bills and taking care of him.”
Late last year, Mark died of a drug overdose, and Privigyi — consumed by grief — wasn’t thinking about insurance when the window to sign up opened and closed.
Then, in June, she got appendicitis. Her bills from two hospitals <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were $33,000.</span>
The argument for having health insurance is the pile of bills she has been collecting — now with late fees added. The obstacle to getting health insurance is that same stack of bills.
“It’s such a gamble, you know, until I figure out what to do with these medical bills,” Privigyi said. “They’re just adding on late fees. How can I even afford to sign up?”

582,"<h3>Health Insurers Raise Rates As Americans Increase Use Of Medical Care</h3>SACRAMENTO, California (AP) — After putting off routine health care for much of the pandemic, Americans are now returning to doctors’ offices in big numbers — a trend that’s starting to show up in higher insurance rates across the country.
Health insurers in individual marketplaces <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 13 states</span> and Washington D.C. will raise rates an average <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10% next</span> year, according to a review of rate filings by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">That’s a big increase after premiums remained virtually flat for several years during the pandemic as insurers seek to recoup costs for more people using their policies, combined with record-high inflation that is driving up prices for virtually everything, including health care.
</span>The rates review included Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
“We’re at a point in the pandemic where people are using health care that they may have put off before,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“We have a double whammy right now of people using more care and inflation throughout the economy.”
</span>In California, state officials announced Tuesday that rates would increase an average <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 6% next</span> year for <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.7 million</span> people who purchase coverage through Covered California, the state-operated health insurance marketplace. That’s a big jump after years of record low increases, when rate increases averaged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1% in</span> the past three years.
Increased use of health plans was the biggest reason for the increase, accounting for four percentage points, according to Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California.
“That is really the consistent message that other states are seeing as well, and even more so than California,” she said.
<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 14.5 million</span> people purchased individual health coverage through state marketplaces this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">That’s a small portion of the total number of insured Americans, as <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 155 million</span> people get their insurance through their employer-sponsored coverage.</span> But Kaiser said the filings for the individual plans are more detailed and publicly available.
The annual open enrollment period for when customers can shop for and <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 2023 coverage</span> starts this fall. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">That’s the main window each year when people on the individual market can buy coverage or change plans.
</span>How much people will pay for coverage depends on a variety of factors, including where they live and what type of plans they choose.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The rate increases come as Congress debates whether to extend financial help for consumers through the American Rescue Plan — <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.9 trillion</span> economic aid package Congress passed last year to combat the economic impacts of the pandemic.
</span>The American Rescue Plan included significant funding to keep health insurance premiums low for people who purchase coverage through state marketplaces.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">California receives <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1.7 billion</span> annually from that funding to make sure no one paid more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8.5% of</span> their household income on monthly premiums.
</span>If that assistance expires at the end of this year, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 million</span> Americans — <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 220,000 Californians</span> — would likely drop coverage because they will no longer be able to afford it, according to an analysis by Covered California.
Without guidance on whether Congress will extend the assistance next year, some insurers have reacted by proactively raising rates in anticipation of people dropping coverage. The uncertainty accounted for half a percentage point of California’<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 6% increase</span>, Altman said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">California officials have lobbied hard for Congress to extend the financial assistance through the American Rescue Plan.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In general, the price of health insurance premiums depends on who is buying coverage.</span> If its mostly sick people, the premiums are more expensive. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">If more healthy people buy them, the premiums cost less.
</span>Altman said California has managed to keep its rate increases below the national average in part because more healthy people are buying coverage through Covered California than most other states.
She said that’s in part because of a California law that taxes people who refuse to purchase health coverage. But she said it’s also because of subsidies that keep premiums low so more people can afford them.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Altman said not extending the federal financial assistance would price some people out of coverage and “is the core outcome to be concerned about here.”
</span>“That would be a big step backwards,” she said.

84464,"<h3>You’re Hired: Trump Plans to Build U.S. Workforce With Apprenticeships</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The president, who hosted NBC’s reality television show ‘The Apprentice,’ will announce an expansion of apprenticeship programs

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 2</span>:00 pm ET

President Donald Trump next week will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.

</span>Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nine <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $60,000 a</span> year, according to the Labor Department.

</span>The administration is committed to “supporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,” Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and assistant, said Friday. “There has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.""

White House officials discussing the president’s goals on Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress. They said Mr. Trump is likely to offer more specifics in the coming days. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He plans to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer, which federal or state governments certify.</span> Workers are trained for skills businesses need and provided hands-on experience. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Since workers are paid while they learn, programs can attract younger Americans seeking to avoid student debt and displaced older workers who need new skills but can’t attend years of college.

</span>Such programs could also address an emerging shortage of skilled workers. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">There were more than six million job openings in April, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2000.</span></span> At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Closing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,” Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they’re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">There were more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 505,000 apprentices</span> in training in fiscal <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">year 2016,</span> the Labor Department said.</span> That was the highest level on record back <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2001,</span> but only <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20,000 higher</span> than the previous peak <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span> And the figure is much smaller than <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 13.3 million</span> students enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Before running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC’s reality television show “The Apprentice.” A senior White House official said the show didn’t inspire the policy push. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Rather, the president’s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common.</span> But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Of the more <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8,000 active</span> apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 20% are</span> in manufacturing.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.

</span>Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Labor Department <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $90 million</span> in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they’re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40%.</span>

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Continuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,” said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Those cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.”

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.

3475,"<h3>Family’s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h3>ISTANBUL — When Alan Kurdi’s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria’s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.
As a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan’s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.
An aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat. Dozens of other relatives — aunts, uncles and cousins — had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.
And just weeks after Alan’s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.
“We die together, or we live together and make a future,” her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.
Alan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria’s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.
So when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.
Interviews <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.
Since Alan’s death, at <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.
Alan’s father, Abdullah, who <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat. He was trying to steer it in the chaos when it foundered in the waves.
But even for Abdullah’s sister Hivrun, grieving her nephew, the calculus remained in favor of risking her children to save them. Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.
Kurdish Roots
Alan’s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.
</span>They had six children. They remember living modest lives not much affected by tensions between the government and Kurds. They spent the summers harvesting olives in Kobani, but saw themselves as city kids. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Most left school after ninth grade to learn the family’s barbering trade.
</span>Fatima, the oldest daughter, was the first to emigrate. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1992,</span> she moved to Canada to marry an Iraqi Kurd. They soon divorced, and she raised their son. Working nights in a printing plant, she caught the attention of a kindly boss.
“She said, ‘Every night I’ll teach <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">you 10 English</span> words,’” Fatima, known as Tima, recalled recently. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The rest I got from watching ‘Barney’ with my son.”
English led to a hairstyling license, jobs at high-end salons and citizenship — successes that made the family’s later journeys possible.
</span>A commanding presence, Fatima became her siblings’ source of advice, information and emergency cash. When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan’s death a force for change.
But before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp — all places soon to be shattered by violence.
Driven From Damascus
The ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.
As the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan’s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family’s Damascus barbershop.
Some of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, “I participated.”
The government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.
“After the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,” Abdullah recalled. “Any simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.”
One day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis’ in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.
Next, Alan’s cousin Shergo,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.
Government artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus — where an armed insurgency was taking shape — from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.
The Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan’s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.
Those two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.
The flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy’s leg.
At the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.
“So I said: ‘Let’s go. Let’s leave,’” Shergo’s mother, Ghousoun recalled. “It’s better than if they take us.”
Kobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, “It didn’t work out that way.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Life on the Run
At first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.
“I suffered a lot, because I’m a very neat person,” Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.
Then a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.
Ghousoun’s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.
By <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.
There, fighters grabbed Ghousoun’s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah’s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.
“They beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,” Ghousoun said later, sobbing. “In front of me.” Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 15,</span> a gun.
“Shoot your father,” they told him.
“They kept saying we were infidels,” Ghousoun said. “But we are not.”
She collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, “they took mercy.”
The family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun’s family in her cowshed.
Back in Kobani, the Kurdi clan’s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.
Many of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.
A Way Station in Turkey
Abdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, “like a chain on my hands.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.
</span>“They sat in the house all day,” he said, choking with tears. “The only thing they were waiting for was me.”
Other Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah’s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.
The promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan’s aunt Fatima <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.
Hivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span>
Options dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.
In June, Mohammad took a smugglers’ boat to Greece and made it to Germany.
Alan’s cousin Yasser,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler’s boat out of Turkey.
Disasters at Sea
Hivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.
</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.
On the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.
Hivrun’s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.
Soon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. “We had decided to go to paradise,” Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe — or the hereafter.
Hours after Alan’s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, “Just keep his head above water!” But all three drowned, one by one.
Other survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, “I’m with you; don’t worry,” just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.
In the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers’ practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.
Abdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because “someone had to.”
Regardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.
Little Solace
Within hours, Alan’s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.
From her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada’s red tape and the world’s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.
“Those kids were born when the war was on,” she recalled telling António Guterres, the United Nations’ high commissioner for refugees. “And they die with the war still on.”
Her raw message helped spur Western countries — briefly, at least — to open their doors to Syrians.
But none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.
In the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun’s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.
“The most important thing,” he said, “is to be together.”
For the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.
In Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat — “a horror film!” one said — but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.
Their father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.
To the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.
He misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.
“I don’t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,” he said. “I am!”
Ghousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads “Kurdi.”
</span>“People always need a haircut,” she said.
A Father’s Heartache
A few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters’ phone numbers, even his dentures.
“I have become a shadow,” Abdullah said.
After he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.
Barely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.
But he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: “Where was all this when my children were alive?”
He called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family’s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons’ favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.
“I want something,” he said, “with their smell.”"
36581,"<h3>Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said — and refused to say — at her confirmation hearing</h3>At her contentious confirmation hearing as Donald Trump’s nominee to be education secretary on Tuesday, Betsy DeVos was asked a question by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) about an important education debate involving how student progress should be measured. The query essentially rendered her speechless as she appeared not to know how to answer. When Franken told her he was upset she didn’t understand it, she did not protest.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">That was just one of several moments during the hearing in which DeVos either displayed a lack of knowledge about education fundamentals or refused to answer questions that Democratic members of the Senate Education Committee believe are critical to her fitness for the job.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">[Betsy DeVos, Trump’s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job]
Here are some of the notable moments:
- DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect against grizzly bears.</span> (She really said this.)
When Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her whether she would agree that guns don’t belong in schools, she said: “I will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.”
And when asked whether she would support President-elect Donald Trump if he, as he has promised, moves to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: “I will support what the president-elect does.” She added: “If the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence.”
[Do guns belong in schools? Trump’s education pick declines to take a stand.]
- DeVos seemed to have no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities.
DeVos said that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA, but when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) later told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it, DeVos responded, “Federal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.” Hassan then asked, “So were you unaware when I just asked you about the IDEA that it was a federal law?” DeVos responded, “I may have confused it.” DeVos did not protest when Hassan said she was upset the nominee didn’t understand the law and urged her to learn about it.
[Betsy DeVos apparently ‘confused’ about federal law protecting students with disabilities]
- DeVos refused to agree with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) that all schools that receive public federal funds — traditional public, public charter or private schools that receive voucher money — should be held to the same standards of accountability.
Kaine: “If confirmed will you insist upon equal accountability in any K-12 school or educational program that receives taxpayer funding whether public, public charter or private?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Equal accountability?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Is that a yes or a no?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Do you not want to answer my question?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Let me ask you this. I think all schools that receive taxpayer funding should be equally accountable. Do you agree?”
DeVos: “Well they don’t, they are not today.”
Kaine: “Well, I think they should. Do you agree with me?
DeVos: “Well no . . . ”
Kaine, interrupting her, said: “You don’t agree with me.” And he moved on to another topic.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">- DeVos said she would review gainful employment regulations without committing to enforce them.
</span>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked DeVos how she planned to protect waste, fraud and abuse from for-profit universities, citing Trump University, which President-elect Donald Trump founded; he ultimately <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span> to settle lawsuits by students who said they were cheated. Trump said he paid the money so he could focus on getting ready to run the country.
DeVos said, “If confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant.” Warren persisted, “I’m asking how.” <span id=""3"" class=""red"">When DeVos said “individuals with whom” she will work in the department will ensure that federal money is properly used, Warren further dug in, and then explained to DeVos that there is actually a group of rules already on the books, the gainful employment regulations.</span> “All you have to do is enforce then,” Warren said, asking DeVos if she would do so. She wouldn’t commit.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The gainful employment regulations are meant to protect students and taxpayers by withholding federal student aid to career training programs that leave students buried in debt with few opportunities to repay.</span> Asked by Warren if she would enforce the regulations, DeVos said: “We will certainly review that rule, and see if it is actually achieving what the intentions are.”
Warren: “I don’t understand about reviewing it. We talked about this in my office. There are already rules in place to stop waste, fraud and abuse. . . . Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this.”
[What we learned about Betsy DeVos’s higher education positions … not much]
- DeVos appeared to have no idea what Franken was talking about when he referred to the accountability debate about whether to use test scores to measure student proficiency or student growth.
Franken noted that the subject had been debated in the education community for years, and said, when she didn’t weigh in and just looked at him without much of an expression on her face, “It surprises me that you don’t know this issue.”
- DeVos did not answer Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) when he asked her what she had learned about the failures of the Detroit traditional public and public charter schools that would inform her decision-making as the secretary of education.
Bennet, a big supporter of charter schools, made the point that school choice isn’t much of a choice when schools aren’t held accountable and families have lousy choices wherever they look. He noted that the Detroit public schools — one of the country’s most troubled systems — has low student achievement, and charter schools in Detroit score only minimally higher. He also cited a study that said charter schools across Michigan perform worse the traditional public schools do.

President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.
Mr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The president’s characterizations of the economy’s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.
</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.
A team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.

The United States is not “rounding the corner” when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.
As case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 20,000.</span>
“And now it’s kind of going back and forth <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 40 and</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,000 cases</span> a day,” Dr. Fauci said. “I have said many times, and I’ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.”

Mr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.
In the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested “regularly.” Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden’s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.

“Fifty thousand in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.”
— Mr. Trump
This is misleading.
Mr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.
In August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes — not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.
It’s unclear <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.

The “New Green Deal” is not a thing.

It is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control.

Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.
Mr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.

Mostly true.
The former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron’s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a “cure,” has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.
The Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron’s <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.
Mr. Biden’s claim that the company <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it.

YANGON, Myanmar—Driving a car here is like waiting for an accident to happen.

More than nine out <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 cars</span> in Myanmar are right-hand drive, as they are in Britain and Japan, but the cars drive on the right-hand side of the road as they do in the U.S. That combination occurs as in few other places.

Drivers are perched toward the curb, instead of the center of the road, and can’t easily judge when to overtake. Some corners are taken blind, while buses often unload passengers in the middle of the street.

“I have to use the horn so people around the other side know I’m coming,” said Aung Thu, a veteran Yangon cabbie.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">People here can’t get enough of them, though, and many are rushing to buy Japanese-made clunkers before a government ban on imports of right-hand-drive cars takes effect in the new year.

</span>The reason? Motorists prefer them to the left-hand-drive Chinese and Korean cars the government wants them to buy.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“They cost more and there are fewer spare parts,” said Thu Thu, who was kicking the tires during a recent visit to a used-car lot in Yangon with his wife and son.</span> One of the cars that caught his eye was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2013 Toyota</span> Corolla, right-hand drive, of course. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Since the government announced its import ban at the end of November, the price had risen <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $16,000 from</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10,000,</span> after including hefty import taxes.

</span>“It’s expensive <span id=""3"" class=""red"">but I fear prices could rise even more once the import ban takes effect,” said Mr. Thu Thu, polishing his wire-rimmed glasses on his green sarong.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Soe Tun, who heads the Myanmar Automobile Manufacturer and Distributor Association, said the sticker price on a car has gone up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20% on</span> average since the ban was announced and could ultimately double once the new rules kick in.

Once known as Burma, this country has long gone back and forth on what side of the road to drive on or where to place the steering wheel. Cars in the former British colony drove on the left until the 1970s, when then-dictator Ne Win decreed that henceforth everyone would drive on the right.

No one really knows why. Some of Ne Win’s other innovations, such as introducing bank notes in denominations of his lucky number, nine, were said to have been made on the advice of his astrologers.

18738,"<h3>Anatomy of a ‘smear’: How John Bolton became a target of the pro-Trump Internet</h3>The story quickly gained more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,000 interactions</span> on Facebook — meaning shares, likes or other user actions — as it spread across pages and groups devoted to defending Trump. Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The attacks, which unfolded vividly in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 24 hours</span> after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases — such as “Book Deal Bolton” — gained currency across the far-right firmament.</span> By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.
The vilification of Bolton — branding him as a traitor and member of the “deep state,” a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him — made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president’s impeachment trial as a “disgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.”
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a “Rejected Neocon” and the “Deep State’s Last Desperate Act.”
</span>That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories — which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency — remain fundamental to his hold on his base.
“It only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,” said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of “American Conspiracy Theories.” The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, “hitting back fairly strongly with a smear that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.”
The path traveled by the “Disobedient Media” entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles.</span> The name of his blog, he said, was based on a “joke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.”
The sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups — with a collective membership of more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 300,000.</span> One of them was a group called “Fox News Sean Hannity,” described as a forum for “all Sean Hannity fans.” The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group — which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host — for what they would hear when they tuned in that night.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton’s boosters, either.
</span>“Now the Republicans don’t like Bolton, so they’ll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,” he said. “But if the Democrats weren’t getting something useful out of him, they wouldn’t be fans either.”
Efforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, “Turned his ‘drug deal’ into a book deal” — a reference to Bolton’s description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia.
The blogger, Craig Weide, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 16,000 followers</span>, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 74,000 within</span> about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called “FOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,” an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network.
The idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee’s rapid response team. “How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,” wrote Steve Guest, the RNC’s rapid-response director. “What a joke.”
Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump’<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2016 campaign</span> and co-host of Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room: Impeachment” podcast, took to Twitter first thing Monday morning to brand the former national security adviser “Book Deal Bolton.” The nickname spread widely on social media during the day, amplified by pro-Trump influencers with tens of thousands of followers.
A joint statement from Bolton, along with his publisher and literary agency, denied any coordination with the media.
Conservative pundits were unconvinced, repackaging Twitter talking points for their prime-time audiences. The epithet “Book Deal Bolton” appeared on screen Monday night on Fox News behind Hannity.
“Good for John,” Hannity said. “He can sell all the books he wants.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">But few went further than Dobbs, the hard-line Fox Business host and Trump whisperer who announced Monday night that Bolton had been “reduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state.”
</span>The accusation of being a “tool for the radical Dems” has been leveled widely on social media in recent months, applied to individuals as disparate as Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and Univision’s Jorge Ramos. What they have in common is rebutting the president’s claims.
Using the same guilt-by-association logic supporting the blog entry in “Disobedient Media,” Dobbs claimed that major donors to Bolton’s super PAC were “never Trumpers.”
“Do you see the pattern here with Mr. Bolton?” Dobbs said, not stating the pattern but relying on his viewers to put together the pieces of the conspiratorial puzzle.
The notion that Bolton, a longtime bugbear of Democrats who has worked in four Republican administrations, was operating furtively within the White House to advance liberal objectives bemused some who have dealt with him. “I think it’s ridiculous, and if it wasn’t so serious, it’d be humorous,” said Chuck Hagel, the former defense secretary and Republican senator from Nebraska.
“It shows you once again that there’s very little honesty, decency or civility in Trump and the crowd around him,” added Hagel, who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Bolton’s nomination as U.N. ambassador foundered, leading to a recess appointment by President George W. Bush. “I had my differences with him, but I would say that John Bolton is anything but ‘deep state.’ ”
Bolton’s lawyer, Charles Cooper, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Of the effort to cast Bolton as a disgruntled government holdover, a former aide, Fred Fleitz, said, “He is an honorable man who had some significant achievements with President Trump in the National Security Council.” Fleitz on Monday published an op-ed urging the former White House official to postpone publication of his book until after the election. But he distanced himself from the more strident criticism, saying in an interview, “I’ve never called John Bolton part of the deep state.”
While lacking in evidence, the assertions made by Dobbs rested on a reliable scaffold of misleading claims bolted into place on Twitter over the course of the day.
An account that goes by the name Philip Schuyler — a Revolutionary-era general who went on to become a senator from New York — and describes itself simply as a “Supporter of President Trump” pointed implausibly to the “deep state.”
“Though a Republican, Bolton would’ve fit nicely into Obama’s ultra conceited deep state,” the user wrote Monday morning. By noon, the conservative columnist Todd Starnes, a former Fox News Radio host, was claiming without evidence or explanation that, “These Bolton allegations smell like Deep State swamp gas.”

Updated Sept.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 7</span>:03 am ET

The corruption scandal around an economic-development fund in Malaysia is spilling beyond the country’s borders, as officials at a United Arab Emirates state investment vehicle raise questions about more than a billion dollars in money that they said is missing.

</span>Abu Dhabi has long been a source of support for the fund, 1Malaysia Development Bhd., which was set up six years ago by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to develop new industries in the Southeast Asian country. Now, as 1MDB tries to fend off a cash crunch, its backers in Abu Dhabi are asking what happened to <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.4 billion</span></span> payment the fund said it made but which they never received, two people familiar with the matter said.

The dispute comes as Mr. Najib is battling a separate scandal linked to 1MDB. Malaysian investigators are examining the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into the prime minister’s alleged private bank accounts through entities linked to 1MDB. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The disclosures have sparked a political crisis and set off a handful of investigations around the world, destabilizing the government and damaging confidence in Malaysia’s economy.

</span>Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing and said he didn’t take money for personal gain.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The U.A.E. is trying to sever its ties to the fund and restructure the entity that provided it with financial support, the people said.

</span>The disputed payments are related to the purchase of power plants around the world by the Malaysian fund <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A state investment fund in Abu Dhabi, the International Petroleum Investment Co., or IPIC, guaranteed <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in bonds that 1MDB issued to finance the purchase, according to the bond offering documents.</span> In return, IPIC was to receive options to buy <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 49% stake</span> in the power plants as well as collateral for the bond.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">According to 1MDB’s financial statements, the Malaysian fund made a collateral payment <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.4 billion</span>.</span> A draft report into 1MDB’s activities by Malaysia’s auditor general, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, said the payment went to a subsidiary of IPIC called Aabar Investments PJS.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">IPIC’s consolidated financial statements, however, contain no reference to the receipt of the payment.</span> Two people familiar with the matter said IPIC and Aabar never received the money. It isn’t clear what happened to the funds. 1MDB didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">In a statement issued after this article was published, 1MDB said it stood by its audited financial accounts, which describe the collateral payment.</span> The auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, had made “specific and detailed” inquiries into the collateral transfer before signing off on the accounts, the Malaysian fund’s statement said.

A spokesman for Deloitte in Hong Kong didn't respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

The dealings between the two countries shines a rare light on the workings of sovereign-wealth funds, which have increased significantly in size and are backed by wealthy governments but often lack transparency. The interactions between the two funds also are attracting scrutiny in Malaysia.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“This relationship is beyond a normal business relationship,” said Tony Pua, a member of the Malaysian opposition Democratic Action Party who sits on a parliamentary committee that also is investigating 1MDB.

</span>Ibrahim Al Abed, a spokesman for the U.A.E., declined to comment, as did the country’s ambassador to the U.S. The office of Mr. Najib, who also is chairman of 1MDB’s board of advisers, didn’t respond to questions. IPIC and Aabar didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transfers.

The U.A.E.’s focus on its dealings with 1MDB is the latest in a series of inquiries into the Malaysian fund.

A Malaysian government probe found that <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $700 million</span> moved through banks, agencies and companies linked to 1MDB before being deposited into Mr. Najib’s alleged private bank accounts ahead of a close election <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> the Journal reported in July.

The source of the money is unclear, and the government investigation hasn’t detailed what happened to the funds that allegedly went into Mr. Najib’s personal accounts. Malaysia’s anticorruption body in August said the funds were a donation from the Middle East. The donor wasn’t specified.

The allegations drew tens of thousands of yellow-clad protesters into the streets of the capital last month. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Malaysia’s currency, the ringgit has fallen to a 17-year low in part due to concerns over the fund.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The 1MDB fund was created to spur economic development by investing in lucrative industries and attracting foreign partners to help finance projects.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The fund has rolled up <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $11 billion</span> in debt to fund purchases of assets, largely made up of power plants and real estate in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka and the U.A.E.

The 1MDB fund’s assets have failed to generate enough cash, and at times it has rescheduled debt payments.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">1MDB said it hopes to repay the debt by selling assets, which the fund’s management has said are valued at more than its borrowings.

</span>The U.A.E.’s rulers in April dismissed IPIC’s managing director for a number of reasons, including issues related to 1MDB, according to the people familiar with the matter, and replaced him with the emirate’s energy minister.

The new management team is investigating the previous managers’ actions and relationship with 1MDB, according to the people. They also are in the early stages of crafting a restructuring plan for IPIC, which itself has become heavily indebted, they added.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">To help shore up the Malaysian fund, IPIC’s new managers this year cut a deal with Malaysia’s finance ministry to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inject $1 billion</span> into 1MDB to cover a maturing bank loan and agreed to take over <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in power-plant bonds it had guaranteed.</span> In return, the Malaysian government will transfer an equal value of assets to IPIC.

In the beginning, Malaysia touted ambitious goals for the fund. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Najib sought to use 1MDB to raise Malaysia’s economic development and standing in the world by going beyond its dependence on exports of raw materials such as natural gas, palm oil and rubber.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Mr. Najib early on turned to the Middle East, a region with which Malaysia has strong ties based on trade and a shared religion in Islam.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Over the next few years, the U.A.E. pledged to invest billions of dollars in projects through 1MDB, including a plan to turn Kuala Lumpur into a global financial center named after Mr. Najib’s father, Malaysia’s second prime minister.

</span>Little of that money ever flowed. Instead, IPIC agreed to back the Malaysian fund’s power-plant bonds, leading to the payments that are the focus of IPIC’s inquiries.

Aabar, the IPIC subsidiary, also helped 1MDB during a disputed audit. According to the Malaysia auditor general’s draft report, 1MDB fired KPMG LLP as its auditor in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2013 after</span> the firm declined to sign off on 1MDB’s accounts unless it received more details <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $2.32 billion</span> the fund said was invested in a Cayman Islands account.

Aabar stepped in and guaranteed the Cayman Islands funds, an official for Deloitte, which took over as 1MDB’s auditor, told a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary committee probing 1MDB, according to a transcript of the proceedings reviewed by the Journal. This guarantee was never made public. Deloitte later signed off on the fund’s accounts. KPMG and Deloitte declined to comment.

Malaysia’s auditor general plans to issue a full report on 1MDB later this year. The central bank last month said it had completed another report into 1MDB, but details haven’t been made public. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission also is probing allegations that cash flowed into Mr. Najib’s alleged accounts.

Two of the transfers into Mr. Najib’s alleged bank accounts <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $681 million</span> came from unknown sources via an account held by a British Virgin Islands-based company at Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss bank owned by Aabar, the U.A.E. fund, according to Malaysian investigation documents reviewed by the Journal. Falcon Bank declined to comment.

Swiss authorities said in August that they have opened a criminal probe into what they called suspicious transactions between Switzerland’s banking system and 1MDB. On Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span> they said they had frozen funds valued at tens of millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts linked to the fund on suspicions of corruption and money laundering.

89359,"<h3>Enabling of Ad Blocking in Apple’s iOS 9 Prompts Backlash</h3>For years, people have longed for ways to stop advertising from popping up on their iPhones and iPads. Now, software to block ads on these gadgets has arrived — and the harsh realities of the practice are causing second thoughts.
Just two days after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps through its new mobile operating system, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">iOS 9,</span> users are embracing the new technology after long complaining that the ads track them, slow down web browsers and are just plain annoying. In less <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 48 hours</span>, several ad-blocking apps with names like Peace, Purify and Crystal soared to the top of Apple’s App Store chart.
Yet some web publishers are now fretting that ads on their sites can’t be viewed because of the blockers, which could threaten these publishers’ livelihoods. On Friday, the maker of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 ad</span>-blocking app Peace, Marco Arment, removed his program from the App Store and offered refunds, saying that while stopping ads does “benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve to be hit.”
This about-face highlights the complexities around the ethics of ad blocking. Advertising underlies much of the Internet, making it possible for people to make a living off the Internet and create the content that users consume. By limiting ads, that implicit contract was violated, some publishers and advertisers said. More distinctions now need to be made around what qualifies as “good” online advertising versus “bad” ads that should be blocked, they said — though they were less clear on who would decide what constitutes a good or bad ad.
“When ad blockers became the most downloaded apps in the App Store, it forced publishers and advertisers to rethink the role that advertising plays on the web,” said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design.
An Apple spokeswoman said that Apple enabled ad blocking in the new version of its mobile software to give customers the option to block content “for an improved mobile browsing experience.”
Ad blocking is not new; people have been able to use ad-blockers on their desktop web browsers for some time. But the number of people installing ad blockers has increased with the arrival of blockers on mobile devices because so much computing has now moved to those devices.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">That means the potential for ad blocking to dent revenue for websites and advertisers is increasing.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 16 percent</span> of those who use the Internet in the United States, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 45 million</span> people, have already installed an ad blocker, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 48 percent</span> over the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 12 months</span>, said Sean Blanchfield, who runs PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad blocking. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a report last month, Adobe and PageFair calculated that blockers would cost publishers <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $22 billion</span> in revenue <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span>
</span>The potential toll of ad blocking has become particularly apparent over the last few days, when several website publishers got caught in the dragnet after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps. John Gruber, a technology blogger who publishes on his site Daring Fireball, posted on Twitter that “it’s wrong” if an ad blocker stops all types of ads.
""The ad network I’m a part of, the Deck, only serves ads that are fast to load and don’t track you,"" Mr. Gruber said. “In my opinion, they’re good-looking ads for high-quality products and services. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Why block that?""
Michael Macher, publisher of the online publication The Awl, said in an article that ran on his site <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 75 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 85 percent</span> of the site’s revenue could be blocked by ad blockers.
</span>Mr. Macher did not respond to requests for comment.
“This will be hard on small publishers,” said David Jacobs, chief executive of 29th Street Publishing, which helps publishers create apps. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“There are definitely some small publishers out there that <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make 50 percent</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 75 percent</span> of their revenue from ads, and they have margins of <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span>.”
</span>He added that some “publishers will really need another way to make money” and that readers should think about what’s happening and how they get a lot of content free. “I think that people have also underestimated how much has to change between the reader and publishers,” he said.
The reaction by publishers has created blowback for some makers of ad-blocking software. Mr. Arment’s app Peace, for instance, faced criticism because it treated all ads the same by blocking all of them. Blocking all ads is an approach that “is too blunt,” Mr. Arment wrote in a blog post. “Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. If we’re going to effect positive change over all, a more nuanced, complex approach is required.”
Mr. Arment did not respond to a request for comment.
Over time, the kinds of ad blockers on mobile devices may change, said Mr. Carroll of the Parsons School of Design. While many ad-blocking apps are now basically cudgels that obstruct all ads, he said he expected there would later be “customizable, free ad blockers with a feature that offers a whitelist for some ads.” Whitelists are a list of approved ads that could get past the blocker.
Others in the online ad industry say they see the explosion of ad blocking as an opportunity to fix a broken system of intrusive, data-heavy ads that slow down the browsing experience.
“It’s the beginning of a new conversation about creating a quality environment for consumers, particularly on mobile devices,” said John Montgomery, chairman of WPP’s GroupM Connect in North America. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I think we should all look at it as an area of concern and deep interest.”
Ad-technology companies like Rubicon Project said they were now working to make the technology behind ads better and less burdensome.
</span>“In ad tech, we tend to look at this as an opportunity to address the core issue, which is making the user experience better,” Neal Richter, Rubicon’s chief technology officer, said in a recent interview."

""BOHEMIAN."" The word comes up when discussing the French designer Isabel Marant. She grudgingly accepts the inescapable. ""I hate to be put in a box,"" she says. ""It's difficult to accept, but it's not a bad tag. I'm bohemian in spirit.""

Although it accurately describes Marant's iconoclastic, freewheeling approach to life, as well as many of her enormously popular creations, from lace minidresses to fringe boots, it minimizes the scope of Marant's designs and her puritanical work ethic. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Her attitude toward the business of fashion, however, is distinctly laissez-faire.

Despite her ambivalence, she has become a runaway fashion success story, born on the back of her trademark look, which can be described as equal parts rock 'n' roll, California surfer girl and insouciant Parisienne.

It's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. ""I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,"" she says. ""It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=""2"" class=""red"">""

Today,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> ""We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,"" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. ""They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.""

Marant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. ""I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,"" she says. ""It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.""

ON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with ""Mister Freedom"" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.

""I always wear my own clothes,"" she says. ""My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe."" She laughs and adds, ""I get a good discount. She's very nice to me."" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. ""I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?""

""It's about the women surrounding me,"" she continues. ""I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse—that's a fantasy.""

It's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe—and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: ""You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?""

Following her instincts has generally served Marant well. ""Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,"" she says. ""It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so."" She continues, ""During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare—when it happens your heart is beating."" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)

She begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. ""This takes time,"" she says. ""Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less."" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. ""I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],"" she says. ""It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.""

In person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. ""I think sometimes I should dye it,"" she says. ""And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' "" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.

Her low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. ""I'm not this goddess of fashion—I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,"" she says. ""I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.""

Her eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean émigrée.

""Everybody is linked,"" Marant says of her large family. ""I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.""

Their differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. ""My mother is quite German,"" she says, ""Very bio-ecologique—very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.""

Marant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. ""They became my family,"" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. ""They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit."" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)

As a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself. She'd leave the house dressed demurely, ""but I had a plastic bag of stuff and I would go to the next building and change,"" she says. After high school, she attended the Studio Berçot fashion school in Paris. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She started an accessories line <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> followed by launching a self-financed womenswear line in a tiny studio <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994,</span></span> when she was <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 26 years</span> old.

</span>Several years later, she fell in love with accessories designer Jérôme Dreyfuss, who now has stores next to hers in Paris's 6th arrondissement and in New York's Soho. She says the two regard work as a separate endeavor, and don't swap ideas. ""It's very restful,"" she says. ""My previous boyfriends all said, 'You spend all the time at the office and don't love me.' I never have to justify myself to Jérôme, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.""

Marant is quite content to have those conversations with herself. In recent years, she has mined Americana for her collections—surf, cowgirl, Elvis, Navajo theme, with studs and grommets galore—but her fall/<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winter 2013 collection</span> was a staid departure. What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. ""I had a kind of sadness,"" she says. ""I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.""

Tomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: ""I <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,"" she says. ""I love cooking—all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans."" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: ""If you have a nice house outside of Paris,"" she explains, ""you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""

She is still seeking to find that balance in her business—although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> ""I don't want to be on every corner. If I open everywhere, then it becomes common. I don't want to overflow the world with Isabel Marant.""

11782,"<h3>More Subprime Borrowers Are Missing Loan Payments</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">More Subprime Borrowers Are Missing Loan Payments
Borrowers with limited or troubled credit histories are defaulting on credit cards, car loans and personal loans
Consumers with low credit scores are falling behind on payments for car loans, personal loans and credit cards, a sign that the healthiest consumer lending environment on record in the U.S. is coming to an end.
</span>The share of subprime credit cards and personal loans that are at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60 days</span></span></span> late is rising faster than normal, according to credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. In March, those delinquencies rose month over month for the eighth time in a row, nearing their prepandemic levels.
Delinquencies on subprime car loans and leases hit an all-time high in February, based on Equifax’s tracking that goes back <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2007.</span>
Many people, including those with less-than-perfect credit, paid off debts and built up savings during the pandemic, a surprising outcome considering that lenders at first thought borrowers would default en masse when Covid-19 hit. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The government’s response, including stimulus payments and child tax credits, boosted many families’ financial health.
</span>But now many of those benefits have run out. Subprime borrowers, who sometimes have lower incomes or less savings, are being hit hard. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Inflation, running near its highest point in four decades, is also forcing many households to choose between paying for essentials and paying their monthly loans.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">There is also a broader concern among some lenders about the ability of consumers overall to keep up with payments when some of their financial benefits, including excess savings that they accrued during the early stages of the pandemic, taper off.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said Tuesday that higher prices for food and gasoline will constrain U.S. households.</span> “We are still in the best credit environment we have ever seen in our lives,” Mr. Scharf said at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival. But, he added, “There will be deterioration in people’s ability to pay.”
The jump in subprime delinquencies could reduce lenders’ willingness to make loans to riskier borrowers.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Last year, many lenders embraced subprime customers, comforted by low unemployment and fueled by an eagerness to rebuild loan balances that took a hit early in the pandemic.</span> Subprime lending hit records last year when measured by the total dollar amount of personal loans originated and spending limits on new general-purpose credit cards, according to Equifax.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">What’s your outlook on the U.S. economy?</span> Join the conversation below.
<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 11% of</span> general-purpose credit cards held by consumers with credit scores <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 620 were</span> at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60 days</span></span></span> behind on payment in March compared <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 9.8% a</span> year prior, according to the latest data available from Equifax. Personal loans and lines of credit delinquencies came in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11.3%,</span> up <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10.4% a</span> year prior. Both categories hit Covid-19-era lows <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7.5% and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8.3%,</span> respectively, in July.
Car loan and lease delinquencies hit a record in February, based on Equifax’s tracking, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 8.8% of</span> subprime accounts behind on payment by at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60 days</span></span></span>. That edged down <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5% in</span> March but was still the second highest level on record.
Fewer people are in subprime credit-score brackets than when the pandemic began. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 18.6% of</span> U.S. adults with credit scores had a score lower <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 in</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> compared <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 15.5% last</span> year, according to Fair Isaac Corp. , creator of FICO scores.
Lenders say that delinquencies are going up from artificially low levels and that their credit portfolios overall remain strong. Many refer to what is happening as a normalization, where delinquency rates return to levels more in line with prepandemic times. Some say their delinquencies remain below their first-<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">quarter 2020 levels</span>.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Capital One Financial Corp. recorded a higher U.S. credit-card 30-day-or-more delinquency rate in the first quarter from a year prior.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Lender Bread Financial Holdings Inc. also reported a higher delinquency rate for its cards and other loans for the quarter.</span> Both lenders issue credit cards to subprime borrowers. Other large card lenders didn’t record this increase for the year-over-year period, said Michael Taiano, senior director at Fitch Ratings’s U.S. banks group.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“It would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is,” Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said on the bank’s last earnings call.</span> “We would expect this is an across-the-board kind of return toward normal over time.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Upstart Holdings Inc., Oportun Financial Corp. , and OneMain Holdings Inc., which facilitate or extend personal loans to people with limited credit histories or low credit scores, also reported increased delinquencies for the first quarter.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Upstart said on its earnings call last week that government stimulus led to a temporary overperformance of consumers.</span> It recently reintroduced loan modifications for borrowers who are struggling to keep up with payments.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Consumers are dealing with a mixed bag of rising gasoline prices and rent, while employment and wage growth remain strong, Raul Vazquez, Oportun’s chief executive, said in an interview.</span> “How that all mixes out we are all going to see in the next few months.”

78042,"<h3>Transcript of Netanyahu’s Speech to Congress</h3>As provided by CQ Roll Call.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you...
(APPLAUSE)
... Speaker of the House John Boehner, President Pro Tem Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Minority — Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
I also want to acknowledge Senator, Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Harry, it’s good to see you back on your feet.
(APPLAUSE)
I guess it’s true what they say, you can’t keep a good man down.
(LAUGHTER)
My friends, I’m deeply humbled by the opportunity to speak for a third time before the most important legislative body in the world, the U.S. Congress.(APPLAUSE)
NETANYAHU: I want to thank you all for being here today. I know that my speech has been the subject of much controversy. I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political. That was never my intention.
I want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans, for your common support for Israel, year after year, decade after decade.
(APPLAUSE)
I know that no matter on which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel.
(APPLAUSE)
The remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States has always been above politics. It must always remain above politics.
(APPLAUSE)
Because America and Israel, we share a common destiny, the destiny of promised lands that cherish freedom and offer hope. Israel is grateful for the support of American — of America’s people and of America’s presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)
NETANYAHU: We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel.
Now, some of that is widely known.
(APPLAUSE)
Some of that is widely known, like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing, opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.
Some of what the president has done for Israel is less well known.
I called him <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 when</span> we had the Carmel forest fire, and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid.
<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> we had our embassy in Cairo under siege, and again, he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment.
Or his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on Hamas terrorists.
(APPLAUSE)
In each of those moments, I called the president, and he was there.
And some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister.
But I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.(APPLAUSE)
NETANYAHU: And Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support, for supporting us in so many ways, especially in generous military assistance and missile defense, including Iron Dome.
(APPLAUSE)
Last summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you, America. Thank you for everything you’ve done for Israel.
My friends, I’ve come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons.
We’re an ancient people. In our <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 4,000 years</span> of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we’ll read the Book of Esther. We’ll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 2,500 years</span> ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies.
The plot was foiled. Our people were saved.
(APPLAUSE)
Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology. He tweets that Israel must be annihilated — he tweets. You know, in Iran, there isn’t exactly free Internet. But he tweets in English that Israel must be destroyed.
For those who believe that Iran threatens the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people, listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s chief terrorist proxy. He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world.
But Iran’s regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazi regime was merely a Jewish problem. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 6 million</span> Jews murdered by the Nazis were but a fraction of <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 million</span> people killed in World War II. So, too, Iran’s regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world. To understand just how dangerous Iran would be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand the nature of the regime.
The people of Iran are very talented people. They’re heirs to one of the world’s great civilizations. But <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1979,</span> they were hijacked by religious zealots — religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.
That year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for Iran. It directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect Iran’s borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The regime’s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, exhorted his followers to “export the revolution throughout the world.”
</span>I’m standing here in Washington, D.C. and the difference is so stark. America’s founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Iran’s founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad. And as states are collapsing across the Middle East, Iran is charging into the void to do just that.
Iran’s goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon, its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights are clutching Israel with three tentacles of terror. Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians. Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq. Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world’s oil supply.
</span>Just last week, near Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier. That’s just last week, while they’re having nuclear talks with the United States. But unfortunately, for the <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 36 years</span>, Iran’s attacks against the United States have been anything but mock. And the targets have been all too real.
Iran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran, murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines, in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Beyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. It helped Al Qaeda bomb U.S. embassies in Africa. It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.
In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana. And if Iran’s aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.
So, at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.
(APPLAUSE)
We must all stand together to stop Iran’s march of conquest, subjugation and terror.
(APPLAUSE)
Now, two years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran. Some change! Some moderation! Rouhani’s government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before.
Last year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I’d like to see someone ask him a question about that.
Iran’s regime is as radical as ever, its cries of “Death to America,” that same America that it calls the “Great Satan,” as loud as ever.
Now, this shouldn’t be surprising, because the ideology of Iran’s revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that’s why this regime will always be an enemy of America.
Don’t be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn’t turn Iran into a friend of America.
Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.
In this deadly game of thrones, there’s no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don’t share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone.
So when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.
(APPLAUSE)
The difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube, whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. We must always remember — I’ll say it one more time — the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can’t let that happen.
(APPLAUSE)
But that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.
Let me explain why. While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don’t need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.
Absent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran.
The first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. Breakout time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.
According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed.
Because Iran’s nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran’s breakout time would be very short — about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel’s.
And if — if Iran’s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.
True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran’s nuclear program and Iran’s adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here’s the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don’t stop them.
Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn’t stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb.
Now, we’re warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100 nuclear</span> bombs.
Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It’s done that on at least three separate occasions —<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2006,</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010.</span> Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.
Now, I know this is not gonna come a shock — as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.
The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught — caught twice, not once, twice — operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn’t even know existed.
Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don’t know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> he said, “If there’s no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 20 years</span> that it doesn’t have one.” Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that’s why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.
But the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.
Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it’s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It’s a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran’s nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs.
Iran’s Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 190,000 centrifuges</span></span>, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">not 6,000 or</span> even <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 19,000 that</span> Iran has today, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">but 10 times</span> that amount —<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 190,000 centrifuges</span> enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision.
My long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.
Now I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.
And by the way, if Iran’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.
So you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That’s why this deal is so bad. It doesn’t block Iran’s path to the bomb; it paves Iran’s path to the bomb.
So why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse?
Well, I disagree. I don’t believe that Iran’s radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 36 years</span>, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would whet appetite — would only whet Iran’s appetite for more.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger?</span> If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it’s under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism?
Why should Iran’s radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world’s: aggression abroad, prosperity at home?
This is a question that everyone asks in our region. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel’s neighbors — Iran’s neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it’s been given a clear path to the bomb.
</span>And many of these neighbors say they’ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won’t change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that’s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.
This deal won’t be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.
If anyone thinks — if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we’ll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.
Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve come here today to tell you we don’t have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don’t have to gamble with our future and with our children’s future.
We can insist that restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.(APPLAUSE)
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things.</span> First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...
(APPLAUSE)
Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world.
(APPLAUSE)
And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you.
If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.
(APPLAUSE)
If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn’t change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.
(APPLAUSE)
If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)
My friends, what about the argument that there’s no alternative to this deal, that Iran’s nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?
Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn’t get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can’t drive. A pilot without a plan can’t fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can’t make nuclear weapons.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">(APPLAUSE)
Iran’s nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.
</span>(APPLAUSE)
Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table — and this often happens in a Persian bazaar — call their bluff. They’ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.
(APPLAUSE)
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.
</span>My friends, for over a year, we’ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It’s a very bad deal. We’re better off without it.
(APPLAUSE)
Now we’re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That’s just not true.
The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.
(APPLAUSE)
A better deal that doesn’t leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in place until Iran’s aggression ends.
(APPLAUSE)
A better deal that won’t give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...
(APPLAUSE)
... no country has a greater stake — no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.
Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths. One path leads to a bad deal that will at best curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war.
The second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal, that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity.
You don’t have to read Robert Frost to know. You have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East and the peace of the world, the peace, we all desire.
(APPLAUSE)
My friend, standing up to Iran is not easy. Standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is. With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel.(APPLAUSE)
Elie, your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words, “never again.”
(APPLAUSE)
And I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past.
(APPLAUSE)
Not to sacrifice the future for the present; not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace.
But I can guarantee you this, the days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over.(APPLAUSE)
We are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves. We restored our sovereignty in our ancient home. And the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 100 generations</span>, we, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves.
(APPLAUSE)
This is why — this is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.
(APPLAUSE)
But I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel.
(APPLAUSE)
I know that you stand with Israel.
(APPLAUSE)
You stand with Israel, because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history’s horrors.
(APPLAUSE)
Facing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking all of us in this (inaudible) chamber is the image of Moses. Moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the Promised Land.
And before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. I leave you with his message today, (SPEAKING IN HEBREW), “Be strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.”
My friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.
May God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all.
You’re wonderful.
Thank you, America. Thank you.
Thank you."

A rally in health-care stocks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 27000 for</span> the first time after the Trump administration abandoned a plan to curb drug rebates.
</span>The decision canceled a proposal that would have eliminated rebates from government drug plans, easing concerns of a massive disruption to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Stocks have been supported this week as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has doubled down on signaling the central bank could cut interest rates later this month.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Speaking during a second day of congressional testimony, Mr. Powell reiterated the Fed’s intention to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.”
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Although investors continue to disagree on how much the Fed will cut rates—opinions vary on whether the central bank will slash by a quarter of a percentage point or half of one—several said Mr. Powell’s comments all but guarantee at least one rate cut as soon as this month.</span> And that supports continuing to hold sizable positions in U.S. stocks, some money managers said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“With the Fed looking almost certain to cut rates in the coming weeks, it is important to position portfolios properly regardless of the outcome,” Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients on Thursday, recommending holding more stocks and cash over short-maturity U.S. government bonds.
</span>Optimism around a rate cut helped push the Dow industrials on the last leg of its journey <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 27000.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">While the milestone doesn’t bare any significance on the market, the new high underscored stocks’ wild ride since last year’s selloff.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">But 2019 has</span> been different. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Fed officials eased up on monetary tightening, announcing earlier this year it would hold rates steady to keep the economy growing.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Resurgent trade tensions in May and deteriorating conditions in Europe and Asia now appear to be pushing the Fed to consider its first rate cut in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 years</span>.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Dow industrials have <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 16% so</span> far this year, while the S&<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 has</span> jumped <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 20%,</span> with much of those gains following the Fed’s encouragements of a rate cut.
</span>On Thursday, shares of UnitedHealth <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained $13.68,</span> or<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.5%,</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $261.16.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Boeing , a trade-sensitive stock, also contributed to the Dow’s climb, <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising $6.70,</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 1.9%,</span> <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $359.</span>

</span>Technology and industrial stocks also notched solid gains following Mr. Powell’s comments, with those sectors <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 0.3% and</span><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.7%,</span> respectively.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">U.S. government-bond yields, meanwhile, extended early gains after data showed that consumer prices rose in June, a sign inflationary pressures could be stabilizing after a period of weakness.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose faster than expected, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note up <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.122% from</span><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.061% a</span> day earlier.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">That nudged financial stocks higher, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 0.6%,</span> as higher interest rates tend to make bank lending more profitable.
