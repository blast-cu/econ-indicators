84464,"<h3>You’re Hired: Trump Plans to Build U.S. Workforce With Apprenticeships</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The president, who hosted NBC’s reality television show ‘The Apprentice,’ will announce an expansion of apprenticeship programs

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 2</span>:00 pm ET

President Donald Trump next week will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.

</span>Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nine <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $60,000 a</span> year, according to the Labor Department.

</span>The administration is committed to “supporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,” Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and assistant, said Friday. “There has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.""

White House officials discussing the president’s goals on Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress. They said Mr. Trump is likely to offer more specifics in the coming days. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He plans to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer, which federal or state governments certify.</span> Workers are trained for skills businesses need and provided hands-on experience. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Since workers are paid while they learn, programs can attract younger Americans seeking to avoid student debt and displaced older workers who need new skills but can’t attend years of college.

</span>Such programs could also address an emerging shortage of skilled workers. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">There were more than six million job openings in April, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2000.</span></span> At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Closing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,” Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they’re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">There were more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 505,000 apprentices</span> in training in fiscal <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">year 2016,</span> the Labor Department said.</span> That was the highest level on record back <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2001,</span> but only <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20,000 higher</span> than the previous peak <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span> And the figure is much smaller than <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 13.3 million</span> students enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Before running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC’s reality television show “The Apprentice.” A senior White House official said the show didn’t inspire the policy push. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Rather, the president’s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common.</span> But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Of the more <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8,000 active</span> apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 20% are</span> in manufacturing.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.

</span>Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Labor Department <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $90 million</span> in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they’re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40%.</span>

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Continuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,” said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Those cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.”

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.

</span>Defense firm Northrop Grumman has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive Wes Bush said businesses need the government’s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don’t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“Our nation’s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today’s workers,” he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“Unfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.”

3475,"<h3>Family’s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h3>ISTANBUL — When Alan Kurdi’s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria’s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.
As a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan’s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.
An aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat. Dozens of other relatives — aunts, uncles and cousins — had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.
And just weeks after Alan’s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.
“We die together, or we live together and make a future,” her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.
Alan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria’s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.
So when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.
Interviews <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.
Since Alan’s death, at <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.
Alan’s father, Abdullah, who <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat. He was trying to steer it in the chaos when it foundered in the waves.
But even for Abdullah’s sister Hivrun, grieving her nephew, the calculus remained in favor of risking her children to save them. Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.
Kurdish Roots
Alan’s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.
</span>They had six children. They remember living modest lives not much affected by tensions between the government and Kurds. They spent the summers harvesting olives in Kobani, but saw themselves as city kids. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Most left school after ninth grade to learn the family’s barbering trade.
</span>Fatima, the oldest daughter, was the first to emigrate. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1992,</span> she moved to Canada to marry an Iraqi Kurd. They soon divorced, and she raised their son. Working nights in a printing plant, she caught the attention of a kindly boss.
“She said, ‘Every night I’ll teach <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">you 10 English</span> words,’” Fatima, known as Tima, recalled recently. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The rest I got from watching ‘Barney’ with my son.”
English led to a hairstyling license, jobs at high-end salons and citizenship — successes that made the family’s later journeys possible.
</span>A commanding presence, Fatima became her siblings’ source of advice, information and emergency cash. When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan’s death a force for change.
But before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp — all places soon to be shattered by violence.
Driven From Damascus
The ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.
As the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan’s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family’s Damascus barbershop.
Some of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, “I participated.”
The government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.
“After the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,” Abdullah recalled. “Any simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.”
One day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis’ in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.
Next, Alan’s cousin Shergo,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.
Government artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus — where an armed insurgency was taking shape — from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.
The Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan’s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.
Those two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.
The flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy’s leg.
At the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.
“So I said: ‘Let’s go. Let’s leave,’” Shergo’s mother, Ghousoun recalled. “It’s better than if they take us.”
Kobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, “It didn’t work out that way.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Life on the Run
At first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.
“I suffered a lot, because I’m a very neat person,” Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.
Then a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.
Ghousoun’s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.
By <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.
There, fighters grabbed Ghousoun’s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah’s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.
“They beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,” Ghousoun said later, sobbing. “In front of me.” Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 15,</span> a gun.
“Shoot your father,” they told him.
“They kept saying we were infidels,” Ghousoun said. “But we are not.”
She collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, “they took mercy.”
The family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun’s family in her cowshed.
Back in Kobani, the Kurdi clan’s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.
Many of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.
A Way Station in Turkey
Abdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop. But when his wife and children finally joined him, he said, the burden overwhelmed him, “like a chain on my hands.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The only apartments he could afford were so far from his work that he had to quit his job, instead lifting 200-pound bags of cement, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">making $9 per</span> 12-hour day.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ghalib and Alan jumped into his bed each morning to snuggle before he slathered them with ointment for their eczema, a ritual that he relished, even as he fretted over the cost of the balm.
</span>“They sat in the house all day,” he said, choking with tears. “The only thing they were waiting for was me.”
Other Kurdis fared no better in Turkey. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Syrians there were often invited to bring their children to factory job interviews, but found, instead of day care, children packing goods in boxes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Jobs disappeared when new Syrians arrived, willing to work for less, and employers sometimes withheld pay.</span> Abdullah’s sister Hivrun cleaned hotel rooms, dozens a day. Ghousoun washed dishes in a restaurant; her son Shergo worked in a clothing sweatshop.
The promise of emigrating to the West seemed distant. In Canada, Alan’s aunt Fatima <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $20,000 to</span> sponsor Mohammad for asylum, with his wife, Ghousoun, and their five children. But Canada required proof of refugee status. Turkey granted Syrians only guest status, which Canada did not accept.
Hivrun applied for resettlement in Germany. Last summer, she received a date for her first interview: Sept.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span>
Options dwindling, Abdullah, Mohammad and Shergo traveled west and crossed a river to Greece. The police beat them with sticks, then sent them back in a rubber raft.
In June, Mohammad took a smugglers’ boat to Greece and made it to Germany.
Alan’s cousin Yasser,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16,</span> fled Damascus to avoid the draft. He, too, boarded a smuggler’s boat out of Turkey.
Disasters at Sea
Hivrun and her husband were the first to take children to sea. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They took four children and an adult nephew south to Izmir, the epicenter of the smuggling trade in Turkey.
</span>Smugglers packed them in windowless vans, left them alone in a wooded area to dodge the police, then put them on a raft aimed at a Greek island a few miles off, but the raft had a broken engine. Only when Hivrun objected was the trip aborted.
On the next try, they were out to sea when water started rushing in. Hivrun saw a Turkish coast guard boat and shouted for help, not stopping even when other passengers, who preferred to risk it, angrily shushed her.
Hivrun’s husband and the older children wanted to try again. Hivrun refused. She took the children back to Istanbul, and her husband and nephew sailed off to Greece.
Soon afterward, Abdullah tried the voyage with his family. “We had decided to go to paradise,” Abdullah explained, a better life, whether in Europe — or the hereafter.
Hours after Alan’s drowning, Abdullah told the story in anguish: The small boat foundered and flipped a few minutes into the journey. He tried to hold on to Ghalib and Alan, calling to his wife, “Just keep his head above water!” But all three drowned, one by one.
Other survivors added new details: Alan cried as water sprayed his eyes; an older woman took him on her lap; the smuggler leapt out, and Abdullah took the tiller. Nervous and inexperienced, he swerved over the waves, telling his children, “I’m with you; don’t worry,” just before the boat capsized. One woman remembered Abdullah, in the water, kissing one of his boys.
In the news media blitz that followed, some reports, quoting an Iraqi couple who lost two children in the disaster, said Abdullah was a smuggler. But it is a standard smugglers’ practice to have an ordinary refugee steer, often in exchange for a discount, and in a later interview, the Iraqis said they believed Abdullah was merely the designated refugee pilot.
Abdullah says that he got no discount, and that he and others tried to take control of the boat because “someone had to.”
Regardless, one thing is clear: Abdullah lost his family.
Little Solace
Within hours, Alan’s aunt in Canada, Fatima, leapt into action.
From her home near Vancouver, she took calls from the news media, blaming Canada’s red tape and the world’s indifference. Soon she was touring Europe to advocate on behalf of refugees.
“Those kids were born when the war was on,” she recalled telling António Guterres, the United Nations’ high commissioner for refugees. “And they die with the war still on.”
Her raw message helped spur Western countries — briefly, at least — to open their doors to Syrians.
But none of that changed the calculus for the Kurdis.
In the remote German town of Villingen, on the edge of the Black Forest, Ghousoun’s husband, Mohammad, worried for his family in Istanbul. He emerged one night from a barracks-like refugee shelter ringed with concertina wire and confided his dilemma: It could take a year or more to bring his family legally, so his decision to keep them off the dangerous boats meant indefinite separation.
“The most important thing,” he said, “is to be together.”
For the same reason, Hivrun broke her vow never to set sail again, determined to rendezvous with her husband. This time, she and her children made it.
In Meppen, Germany, a few weeks later, her children recounted the wet, terrifying moments on the boat — “a horror film!” one said — but now they were eating ice cream with a view of yellow autumn leaves.
Their father was stuck in a separate camp, three hours away. But after several weeks of haranguing the authorities, they got their wish: They could move, all together, to an apartment.
To the south, near Heidelberg, Yasser, the teenager who fled alone, was even more bullish on Germany, pinning the colors of its flag over a bed with a heart-shaped plush pillow. As an unaccompanied minor, he receives benefits like carpentry classes and excursions.
He misses his mother, but he already speaks passable German, knows the city and even has a German girlfriend. Wearing his hair in an Elvis-like pompadour, he plans to open a barbershop and study acting.
“I don’t want to lie to you and tell you that I am not happy,” he said. “I am!”
Ghousoun and Mohammad expect to be reunited in Canada on Monday, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">among 10,000 Syrians</span> admitted by a new Liberal government. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Fatima has a job for Mohammad in her new salon, where the sign over the door reads “Kurdi.”
</span>“People always need a haircut,” she said.
A Father’s Heartache
A few weeks after the tragedy, Abdullah sat, angular and stiff and out of place, on a leather sofa in the piano bar of a gilt-trimmed hotel in Erbil, in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The sea had sheared him of all trappings of identity: his documents, his sisters’ phone numbers, even his dentures.
“I have become a shadow,” Abdullah said.
After he buried his family in Kobani, in three graves on a treeless plain, he was whisked to Erbil by the powerful Barzani clan. He had resolved to use the spotlight on his grief to aid other Syrians, and the Barzanis were promising help.
Barely understanding Kurdish, he went gamely to meetings with the rich and powerful, and delivered aid to refugee camps, happiest when playing with children.
But he often seemed dazed. He wore a single plain, khaki-colored outfit every day, refusing to let his benefactors buy more. He had never been in a place like this, with <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $99 Sunday</span> brunch, and could not stop thinking: “Where was all this when my children were alive?”
He called his Canadian sister, Fatima, who was collecting his family’s things in Istanbul. She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons’ favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.
“I want something,” he said, “with their smell.”"

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">That was just one of several moments during the hearing in which DeVos either displayed a lack of knowledge about education fundamentals or refused to answer questions that Democratic members of the Senate Education Committee believe are critical to her fitness for the job.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">[Betsy DeVos, Trump’s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job]
Here are some of the notable moments:
- DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect against grizzly bears.</span> (She really said this.)
When Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her whether she would agree that guns don’t belong in schools, she said: “I will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.”
And when asked whether she would support President-elect Donald Trump if he, as he has promised, moves to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: “I will support what the president-elect does.” She added: “If the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence.”
[Do guns belong in schools? Trump’s education pick declines to take a stand.]
- DeVos seemed to have no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities.
DeVos said that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA, but when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) later told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it, DeVos responded, “Federal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.” Hassan then asked, “So were you unaware when I just asked you about the IDEA that it was a federal law?” DeVos responded, “I may have confused it.” DeVos did not protest when Hassan said she was upset the nominee didn’t understand the law and urged her to learn about it.
[Betsy DeVos apparently ‘confused’ about federal law protecting students with disabilities]
- DeVos refused to agree with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) that all schools that receive public federal funds — traditional public, public charter or private schools that receive voucher money — should be held to the same standards of accountability.
Kaine: “If confirmed will you insist upon equal accountability in any K-12 school or educational program that receives taxpayer funding whether public, public charter or private?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Equal accountability?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Is that a yes or a no?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Do you not want to answer my question?”
DeVos: “I support accountability.”
Kaine: “Let me ask you this. I think all schools that receive taxpayer funding should be equally accountable. Do you agree?”
DeVos: “Well they don’t, they are not today.”
Kaine: “Well, I think they should. Do you agree with me?
DeVos: “Well no . . . ”
Kaine, interrupting her, said: “You don’t agree with me.” And he moved on to another topic.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">- DeVos said she would review gainful employment regulations without committing to enforce them.
</span>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked DeVos how she planned to protect waste, fraud and abuse from for-profit universities, citing Trump University, which President-elect Donald Trump founded; he ultimately <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span> to settle lawsuits by students who said they were cheated. Trump said he paid the money so he could focus on getting ready to run the country.
DeVos said, “If confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant.” Warren persisted, “I’m asking how.” <span id=""3"" class=""red"">When DeVos said “individuals with whom” she will work in the department will ensure that federal money is properly used, Warren further dug in, and then explained to DeVos that there is actually a group of rules already on the books, the gainful employment regulations.</span> “All you have to do is enforce then,” Warren said, asking DeVos if she would do so. She wouldn’t commit.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The gainful employment regulations are meant to protect students and taxpayers by withholding federal student aid to career training programs that leave students buried in debt with few opportunities to repay.</span> Asked by Warren if she would enforce the regulations, DeVos said: “We will certainly review that rule, and see if it is actually achieving what the intentions are.”
Warren: “I don’t understand about reviewing it. We talked about this in my office. There are already rules in place to stop waste, fraud and abuse. . . . Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this.”
[What we learned about Betsy DeVos’s higher education positions … not much]
- DeVos appeared to have no idea what Franken was talking about when he referred to the accountability debate about whether to use test scores to measure student proficiency or student growth.
Franken noted that the subject had been debated in the education community for years, and said, when she didn’t weigh in and just looked at him without much of an expression on her face, “It surprises me that you don’t know this issue.”
- DeVos did not answer Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) when he asked her what she had learned about the failures of the Detroit traditional public and public charter schools that would inform her decision-making as the secretary of education.
Bennet, a big supporter of charter schools, made the point that school choice isn’t much of a choice when schools aren’t held accountable and families have lousy choices wherever they look. He noted that the Detroit public schools — one of the country’s most troubled systems — has low student achievement, and charter schools in Detroit score only minimally higher. He also cited a study that said charter schools across Michigan perform worse the traditional public schools do. But instead of answering his question, she told him she wanted to give him “context” about Detroit, to which he responded, “With respect, I’m not asking for a history of Detroit.” She also said, “I think there is a lot that has gone right” there, but she never answered his question.
- <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And here’s a bonus:
DeVos said her name should not have been included on tax forms for her mother’s foundation, which has contributed to controversial causes.</span> The forms say that she was vice president and a member of the board.
“That was a clerical error,” DeVos said. “I have never made decisions on my mother’s behalf.”

President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.
Mr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The president’s characterizations of the economy’s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.

The United States is not “rounding the corner” when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.
As case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 20,000.</span>

Mr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.
In the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested “regularly.” Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden’s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.

This is misleading.
Mr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.
In August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes — not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.
It’s unclear <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.

It is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control.

Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.
Mr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.
“There is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many — we <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.”
— Mr. Biden
Mostly true.
The former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron’s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a “cure,” has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.
The Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron’s <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.
Mr. Biden’s claim that the company <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=""82"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=""83"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.
“I’m very underleveraged. <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""33"" class=""red"">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared — in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.”
— Mr. Trump
This lacks evidence.
</span></span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""84"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump’s business empire.</span>"
29761,"<h3>Myanmar’s Fans of Right-Hand Cars Feel Wronged by State Ban</h3>Government says the cars are unsafe in a country where cars drive in the right lane; locals object to being steered toward left-hand-drive models

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 5</span>:33 am ET

YANGON, Myanmar—Driving a car here is like waiting for an accident to happen.

More than nine out <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 cars</span> in Myanmar are right-hand drive, as they are in Britain and Japan, but the cars drive on the right-hand side of the road as they do in the U.S. That combination occurs as in few other places.

Drivers are perched toward the curb, instead of the center of the road, and can’t easily judge when to overtake. Some corners are taken blind, while buses often unload passengers in the middle of the street.

“I have to use the horn so people around the other side know I’m coming,” said Aung Thu, a veteran Yangon cabbie.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">People here can’t get enough of them, though, and many are rushing to buy Japanese-made clunkers before a government ban on imports of right-hand-drive cars takes effect in the new year.

</span>The reason? Motorists prefer them to the left-hand-drive Chinese and Korean cars the government wants them to buy.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“They cost more and there are fewer spare parts,” said Thu Thu, who was kicking the tires during a recent visit to a used-car lot in Yangon with his wife and son.</span> One of the cars that caught his eye was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2013 Toyota</span> Corolla, right-hand drive, of course. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Since the government announced its import ban at the end of November, the price had risen <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $16,000 from</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10,000,</span> after including hefty import taxes.

</span>“It’s expensive <span id=""3"" class=""red"">but I fear prices could rise even more once the import ban takes effect,” said Mr. Thu Thu, polishing his wire-rimmed glasses on his green sarong.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Soe Tun, who heads the Myanmar Automobile Manufacturer and Distributor Association, said the sticker price on a car has gone up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20% on</span> average since the ban was announced and could ultimately double once the new rules kick in.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The unpredictability buyers face, he said, is symptomatic of how the economy is still largely guided by the heavy hand of the state five years after the military began ceding power to civilian leaders, including the current de facto head of government, the former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“How is anyone supposed to come up with a business plan when we don’t know how much it’s going to cost to move things around?”</span> Mr. Soe Tun said. “Nobody knows what’s going on,” he said, noting that the regulatory uncertainty is deterring foreign investors.

Official government statistics show foreign-direct investment <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell $650 million</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $3.29 billion</span> in April through November, compared <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $3.94 billion</span> in the same period a year earlier.

Once known as Burma, this country has long gone back and forth on what side of the road to drive on or where to place the steering wheel. Cars in the former British colony drove on the left until the 1970s, when then-dictator Ne Win decreed that henceforth everyone would drive on the right.

No one really knows why. Some of Ne Win’s other innovations, such as introducing bank notes in denominations of his lucky number, nine, were said to have been made on the advice of his astrologers.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Western sanctions during the years of military dictatorship, meanwhile, blocked Myanmar’s access to suitable left-hand-drive imports from Europe or the U.S., forcing the country to turn to Japan, which produces them in the right-hand-drive format.

</span>Other countries have wrestled with the question of where to place the steering wheel or which side to drive on.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In the early hours of Sept.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2009,</span> Samoa switched from driving on the right to driving on the left, as is the custom in its two biggest trading partners, New Zealand and Australia.

</span>The Japanese island of Okinawa, home to U.S. military bases, became right-hand drive during the American occupation after World War II and only joined the rest of the country in driving on the left <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1978.</span>

The U.S. was also confused for a while about what it wanted to do. Ford Motor Co., for instance, made right-hand-drive cars <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 1908.</span>

Some people in Myanmar sense ulterior motives for the government’s rule change. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">A few rows down from Mr. Thu Thu at the used-car lot, Aung Aung, a university student, speculated that while the government says the measure is to improve road safety, its true purpose is to push prices higher and slow the influx of new cars causing traffic jams on Yangon’s potholed streets.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">More <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500,000 cars</span> were imported from Japan over the past four years—most of which ended up in Yangon.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">For others, the new rules are an affront to their right to buy whatever they want after decades of military rule and economic sanctions.

</span>“We should have the freedom to choose, and if they choose a right-hand-drive car that’s fine,” said Tin Maung Hlaing, managing director at local car dealer Evergreen Autos, as he popped the hood on a red right-hand <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drive 2013 Honda</span> at his showroom. “People are used to them by now.”

18738,"<h3>Anatomy of a ‘smear’: How John Bolton became a target of the pro-Trump Internet</h3>The story quickly gained more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,000 interactions</span> on Facebook — meaning shares, likes or other user actions — as it spread across pages and groups devoted to defending Trump. Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The attacks, which unfolded vividly in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 24 hours</span> after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases — such as “Book Deal Bolton” — gained currency across the far-right firmament.</span> By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.
The vilification of Bolton — branding him as a traitor and member of the “deep state,” a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him — made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president’s impeachment trial as a “disgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.”
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a “Rejected Neocon” and the “Deep State’s Last Desperate Act.”
</span>That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories — which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency — remain fundamental to his hold on his base.
“It only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,” said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of “American Conspiracy Theories.” The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, “hitting back fairly strongly with a smear that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.”
The path traveled by the “Disobedient Media” entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles.</span> The name of his blog, he said, was based on a “joke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.”
The sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups — with a collective membership of more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 300,000.</span> One of them was a group called “Fox News Sean Hannity,” described as a forum for “all Sean Hannity fans.” The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group — which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host — for what they would hear when they tuned in that night.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton’s boosters, either.
</span>“Now the Republicans don’t like Bolton, so they’ll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,” he said. “But if the Democrats weren’t getting something useful out of him, they wouldn’t be fans either.”
Efforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, “Turned his ‘drug deal’ into a book deal” — a reference to Bolton’s description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia.
The blogger, Craig Weide, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 16,000 followers</span>, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 74,000 within</span> about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called “FOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,” an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network.
The idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee’s rapid response team. “How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,” wrote Steve Guest, the RNC’s rapid-response director. “What a joke.”
Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump’<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2016 campaign</span> and co-host of Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room: Impeachment” podcast, took to Twitter first thing Monday morning to brand the former national security adviser “Book Deal Bolton.” The nickname spread widely on social media during the day, amplified by pro-Trump influencers with tens of thousands of followers.
A joint statement from Bolton, along with his publisher and literary agency, denied any coordination with the media.
Conservative pundits were unconvinced, repackaging Twitter talking points for their prime-time audiences. The epithet “Book Deal Bolton” appeared on screen Monday night on Fox News behind Hannity.
“Good for John,” Hannity said. “He can sell all the books he wants.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">But few went further than Dobbs, the hard-line Fox Business host and Trump whisperer who announced Monday night that Bolton had been “reduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state.”
</span>The accusation of being a “tool for the radical Dems” has been leveled widely on social media in recent months, applied to individuals as disparate as Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and Univision’s Jorge Ramos. What they have in common is rebutting the president’s claims.
Using the same guilt-by-association logic supporting the blog entry in “Disobedient Media,” Dobbs claimed that major donors to Bolton’s super PAC were “never Trumpers.”
“Do you see the pattern here with Mr. Bolton?” Dobbs said, not stating the pattern but relying on his viewers to put together the pieces of the conspiratorial puzzle.
The notion that Bolton, a longtime bugbear of Democrats who has worked in four Republican administrations, was operating furtively within the White House to advance liberal objectives bemused some who have dealt with him. “I think it’s ridiculous, and if it wasn’t so serious, it’d be humorous,” said Chuck Hagel, the former defense secretary and Republican senator from Nebraska.
“It shows you once again that there’s very little honesty, decency or civility in Trump and the crowd around him,” added Hagel, who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Bolton’s nomination as U.N. ambassador foundered, leading to a recess appointment by President George W. Bush. “I had my differences with him, but I would say that John Bolton is anything but ‘deep state.’ ”
Bolton’s lawyer, Charles Cooper, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Of the effort to cast Bolton as a disgruntled government holdover, a former aide, Fred Fleitz, said, “He is an honorable man who had some significant achievements with President Trump in the National Security Council.” Fleitz on Monday published an op-ed urging the former White House official to postpone publication of his book until after the election. But he distanced himself from the more strident criticism, saying in an interview, “I’ve never called John Bolton part of the deep state.”
While lacking in evidence, the assertions made by Dobbs rested on a reliable scaffold of misleading claims bolted into place on Twitter over the course of the day.
An account that goes by the name Philip Schuyler — a Revolutionary-era general who went on to become a senator from New York — and describes itself simply as a “Supporter of President Trump” pointed implausibly to the “deep state.”
“Though a Republican, Bolton would’ve fit nicely into Obama’s ultra conceited deep state,” the user wrote Monday morning. By noon, the conservative columnist Todd Starnes, a former Fox News Radio host, was claiming without evidence or explanation that, “These Bolton allegations smell like Deep State swamp gas.”

Updated Sept.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 7</span>:03 am ET

The corruption scandal around an economic-development fund in Malaysia is spilling beyond the country’s borders, as officials at a United Arab Emirates state investment vehicle raise questions about more than a billion dollars in money that they said is missing.

</span>Abu Dhabi has long been a source of support for the fund, 1Malaysia Development Bhd., which was set up six years ago by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to develop new industries in the Southeast Asian country. Now, as 1MDB tries to fend off a cash crunch, its backers in Abu Dhabi are asking what happened to <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.4 billion</span></span> payment the fund said it made but which they never received, two people familiar with the matter said.

The dispute comes as Mr. Najib is battling a separate scandal linked to 1MDB. Malaysian investigators are examining the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into the prime minister’s alleged private bank accounts through entities linked to 1MDB. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The disclosures have sparked a political crisis and set off a handful of investigations around the world, destabilizing the government and damaging confidence in Malaysia’s economy.

</span>Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing and said he didn’t take money for personal gain.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The U.A.E. is trying to sever its ties to the fund and restructure the entity that provided it with financial support, the people said.

</span>The disputed payments are related to the purchase of power plants around the world by the Malaysian fund <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A state investment fund in Abu Dhabi, the International Petroleum Investment Co., or IPIC, guaranteed <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in bonds that 1MDB issued to finance the purchase, according to the bond offering documents.</span> In return, IPIC was to receive options to buy <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 49% stake</span> in the power plants as well as collateral for the bond.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">According to 1MDB’s financial statements, the Malaysian fund made a collateral payment <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.4 billion</span>.</span> A draft report into 1MDB’s activities by Malaysia’s auditor general, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, said the payment went to a subsidiary of IPIC called Aabar Investments PJS.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">IPIC’s consolidated financial statements, however, contain no reference to the receipt of the payment.</span> Two people familiar with the matter said IPIC and Aabar never received the money. It isn’t clear what happened to the funds. 1MDB didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">In a statement issued after this article was published, 1MDB said it stood by its audited financial accounts, which describe the collateral payment.</span> The auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, had made “specific and detailed” inquiries into the collateral transfer before signing off on the accounts, the Malaysian fund’s statement said.

A spokesman for Deloitte in Hong Kong didn't respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

The dealings between the two countries shines a rare light on the workings of sovereign-wealth funds, which have increased significantly in size and are backed by wealthy governments but often lack transparency. The interactions between the two funds also are attracting scrutiny in Malaysia.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“This relationship is beyond a normal business relationship,” said Tony Pua, a member of the Malaysian opposition Democratic Action Party who sits on a parliamentary committee that also is investigating 1MDB.

</span>Ibrahim Al Abed, a spokesman for the U.A.E., declined to comment, as did the country’s ambassador to the U.S. The office of Mr. Najib, who also is chairman of 1MDB’s board of advisers, didn’t respond to questions. IPIC and Aabar didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transfers.

The U.A.E.’s focus on its dealings with 1MDB is the latest in a series of inquiries into the Malaysian fund.

A Malaysian government probe found that <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $700 million</span> moved through banks, agencies and companies linked to 1MDB before being deposited into Mr. Najib’s alleged private bank accounts ahead of a close election <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> the Journal reported in July.

The source of the money is unclear, and the government investigation hasn’t detailed what happened to the funds that allegedly went into Mr. Najib’s personal accounts. Malaysia’s anticorruption body in August said the funds were a donation from the Middle East. The donor wasn’t specified.

The allegations drew tens of thousands of yellow-clad protesters into the streets of the capital last month. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Malaysia’s currency, the ringgit has fallen to a 17-year low in part due to concerns over the fund.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The 1MDB fund was created to spur economic development by investing in lucrative industries and attracting foreign partners to help finance projects.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The fund has rolled up <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $11 billion</span> in debt to fund purchases of assets, largely made up of power plants and real estate in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka and the U.A.E.

The 1MDB fund’s assets have failed to generate enough cash, and at times it has rescheduled debt payments.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">1MDB said it hopes to repay the debt by selling assets, which the fund’s management has said are valued at more than its borrowings.

</span>The U.A.E.’s rulers in April dismissed IPIC’s managing director for a number of reasons, including issues related to 1MDB, according to the people familiar with the matter, and replaced him with the emirate’s energy minister.

The new management team is investigating the previous managers’ actions and relationship with 1MDB, according to the people. They also are in the early stages of crafting a restructuring plan for IPIC, which itself has become heavily indebted, they added.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">To help shore up the Malaysian fund, IPIC’s new managers this year cut a deal with Malaysia’s finance ministry to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inject $1 billion</span> into 1MDB to cover a maturing bank loan and agreed to take over <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3.5 billion</span></span> in power-plant bonds it had guaranteed.</span> In return, the Malaysian government will transfer an equal value of assets to IPIC.

In the beginning, Malaysia touted ambitious goals for the fund. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Najib sought to use 1MDB to raise Malaysia’s economic development and standing in the world by going beyond its dependence on exports of raw materials such as natural gas, palm oil and rubber.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Mr. Najib early on turned to the Middle East, a region with which Malaysia has strong ties based on trade and a shared religion in Islam.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Over the next few years, the U.A.E. pledged to invest billions of dollars in projects through 1MDB, including a plan to turn Kuala Lumpur into a global financial center named after Mr. Najib’s father, Malaysia’s second prime minister.

</span>Little of that money ever flowed. Instead, IPIC agreed to back the Malaysian fund’s power-plant bonds, leading to the payments that are the focus of IPIC’s inquiries.

Aabar, the IPIC subsidiary, also helped 1MDB during a disputed audit. According to the Malaysia auditor general’s draft report, 1MDB fired KPMG LLP as its auditor in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2013 after</span> the firm declined to sign off on 1MDB’s accounts unless it received more details <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $2.32 billion</span> the fund said was invested in a Cayman Islands account.

Aabar stepped in and guaranteed the Cayman Islands funds, an official for Deloitte, which took over as 1MDB’s auditor, told a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary committee probing 1MDB, according to a transcript of the proceedings reviewed by the Journal. This guarantee was never made public. Deloitte later signed off on the fund’s accounts. KPMG and Deloitte declined to comment.

Malaysia’s auditor general plans to issue a full report on 1MDB later this year. The central bank last month said it had completed another report into 1MDB, but details haven’t been made public. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission also is probing allegations that cash flowed into Mr. Najib’s alleged accounts.

Two of the transfers into Mr. Najib’s alleged bank accounts <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $681 million</span> came from unknown sources via an account held by a British Virgin Islands-based company at Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss bank owned by Aabar, the U.A.E. fund, according to Malaysian investigation documents reviewed by the Journal. Falcon Bank declined to comment.

Swiss authorities said in August that they have opened a criminal probe into what they called suspicious transactions between Switzerland’s banking system and 1MDB. On Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span> they said they had frozen funds valued at tens of millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts linked to the fund on suspicions of corruption and money laundering.

89359,"<h3>Enabling of Ad Blocking in Apple’s iOS 9 Prompts Backlash</h3>For years, people have longed for ways to stop advertising from popping up on their iPhones and iPads. Now, software to block ads on these gadgets has arrived — and the harsh realities of the practice are causing second thoughts.
Just two days after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps through its new mobile operating system, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">iOS 9,</span> users are embracing the new technology after long complaining that the ads track them, slow down web browsers and are just plain annoying. In less <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 48 hours</span>, several ad-blocking apps with names like Peace, Purify and Crystal soared to the top of Apple’s App Store chart.
Yet some web publishers are now fretting that ads on their sites can’t be viewed because of the blockers, which could threaten these publishers’ livelihoods. On Friday, the maker of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 ad</span>-blocking app Peace, Marco Arment, removed his program from the App Store and offered refunds, saying that while stopping ads does “benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve to be hit.”
This about-face highlights the complexities around the ethics of ad blocking. Advertising underlies much of the Internet, making it possible for people to make a living off the Internet and create the content that users consume. By limiting ads, that implicit contract was violated, some publishers and advertisers said. More distinctions now need to be made around what qualifies as “good” online advertising versus “bad” ads that should be blocked, they said — though they were less clear on who would decide what constitutes a good or bad ad.
“When ad blockers became the most downloaded apps in the App Store, it forced publishers and advertisers to rethink the role that advertising plays on the web,” said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design.
An Apple spokeswoman said that Apple enabled ad blocking in the new version of its mobile software to give customers the option to block content “for an improved mobile browsing experience.”
Ad blocking is not new; people have been able to use ad-blockers on their desktop web browsers for some time. But the number of people installing ad blockers has increased with the arrival of blockers on mobile devices because so much computing has now moved to those devices.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">That means the potential for ad blocking to dent revenue for websites and advertisers is increasing.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 16 percent</span> of those who use the Internet in the United States, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 45 million</span> people, have already installed an ad blocker, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 48 percent</span> over the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 12 months</span>, said Sean Blanchfield, who runs PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad blocking. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a report last month, Adobe and PageFair calculated that blockers would cost publishers <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $22 billion</span> in revenue <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span>
</span>The potential toll of ad blocking has become particularly apparent over the last few days, when several website publishers got caught in the dragnet after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps. John Gruber, a technology blogger who publishes on his site Daring Fireball, posted on Twitter that “it’s wrong” if an ad blocker stops all types of ads.
""The ad network I’m a part of, the Deck, only serves ads that are fast to load and don’t track you,"" Mr. Gruber said. “In my opinion, they’re good-looking ads for high-quality products and services. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Why block that?""
Michael Macher, publisher of the online publication The Awl, said in an article that ran on his site <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 75 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 85 percent</span> of the site’s revenue could be blocked by ad blockers.
</span>Mr. Macher did not respond to requests for comment.
“This will be hard on small publishers,” said David Jacobs, chief executive of 29th Street Publishing, which helps publishers create apps. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“There are definitely some small publishers out there that <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make 50 percent</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 75 percent</span> of their revenue from ads, and they have margins of <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span>.”
</span>He added that some “publishers will really need another way to make money” and that readers should think about what’s happening and how they get a lot of content free. “I think that people have also underestimated how much has to change between the reader and publishers,” he said.
The reaction by publishers has created blowback for some makers of ad-blocking software. Mr. Arment’s app Peace, for instance, faced criticism because it treated all ads the same by blocking all of them. Blocking all ads is an approach that “is too blunt,” Mr. Arment wrote in a blog post. “Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. If we’re going to effect positive change over all, a more nuanced, complex approach is required.”
Mr. Arment did not respond to a request for comment.
Over time, the kinds of ad blockers on mobile devices may change, said Mr. Carroll of the Parsons School of Design. While many ad-blocking apps are now basically cudgels that obstruct all ads, he said he expected there would later be “customizable, free ad blockers with a feature that offers a whitelist for some ads.” Whitelists are a list of approved ads that could get past the blocker.
Others in the online ad industry say they see the explosion of ad blocking as an opportunity to fix a broken system of intrusive, data-heavy ads that slow down the browsing experience.
“It’s the beginning of a new conversation about creating a quality environment for consumers, particularly on mobile devices,” said John Montgomery, chairman of WPP’s GroupM Connect in North America. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I think we should all look at it as an area of concern and deep interest.”
Ad-technology companies like Rubicon Project said they were now working to make the technology behind ads better and less burdensome.
</span>“In ad tech, we tend to look at this as an opportunity to address the core issue, which is making the user experience better,” Neal Richter, Rubicon’s chief technology officer, said in a recent interview."

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:52 pm ET

""BOHEMIAN."" The word comes up when discussing the French designer Isabel Marant. She grudgingly accepts the inescapable. ""I hate to be put in a box,"" she says. ""It's difficult to accept, but it's not a bad tag. I'm bohemian in spirit.""

Although it accurately describes Marant's iconoclastic, freewheeling approach to life, as well as many of her enormously popular creations, from lace minidresses to fringe boots, it minimizes the scope of Marant's designs and her puritanical work ethic. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Her attitude toward the business of fashion, however, is distinctly laissez-faire.

</span>""I never dreamed of being a big designer,"" Marant,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> says. ""I don't care about being known all over the world.""

Despite her ambivalence, she has become a runaway fashion success story, born on the back of her trademark look, which can be described as equal parts rock 'n' roll, California surfer girl and insouciant Parisienne. Her line caters to those who aspire to passions beyond clothes but have the means to buy—and buy a lot. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Since the inception of her namesake label <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994,</span></span> sales have increased at a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">steady 30 percent</span> each year—even during the economic downturn—allowing her to prosper as an independent label in an era of behemoths like LVMH, Prada Group and Kering.</span> There <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 13 of</span> her sparely designed Isabel Marant boutiques in countries from South Korea to Lebanon, and both of her lines (there is also a diffusion label, Isabel Marant Étoile) are carried <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 800 retailers</span> worldwide. This November, she will join the ranks of Stella McCartney, Versace, Lanvin and Karl Lagerfeld as the next designer to collaborate with global mass retailer H&M, where she will also debut a men's collection.

It's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. ""I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,"" she says. ""It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=""2"" class=""red"">""

Today,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> ""We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,"" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. ""They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.""

Marant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. ""I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,"" she says. ""It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.""

ON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with ""Mister Freedom"" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.

""I always wear my own clothes,"" she says. ""My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe."" She laughs and adds, ""I get a good discount. She's very nice to me."" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. ""I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?""

""It's about the women surrounding me,"" she continues. ""I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse—that's a fantasy.""

It's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe—and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: ""You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?""

Following her instincts has generally served Marant well. ""Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,"" she says. ""It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so."" She continues, ""During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare—when it happens your heart is beating."" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)

She begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. ""This takes time,"" she says. ""Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less."" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. ""I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],"" she says. ""It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.""

In person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. ""I think sometimes I should dye it,"" she says. ""And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' "" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.

Her low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. ""I'm not this goddess of fashion—I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,"" she says. ""I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.""

Her eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean émigrée.

""Everybody is linked,"" Marant says of her large family. ""I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.""

Their differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. ""My mother is quite German,"" she says, ""Very bio-ecologique—very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.""

Marant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. ""They became my family,"" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. ""They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit."" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)

As a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself. She'd leave the house dressed demurely, ""but I had a plastic bag of stuff and I would go to the next building and change,"" she says. After high school, she attended the Studio Berçot fashion school in Paris. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She started an accessories line <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> followed by launching a self-financed womenswear line in a tiny studio <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994,</span></span> when she was <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 26 years</span> old.

</span>Several years later, she fell in love with accessories designer Jérôme Dreyfuss, who now has stores next to hers in Paris's 6th arrondissement and in New York's Soho. She says the two regard work as a separate endeavor, and don't swap ideas. ""It's very restful,"" she says. ""My previous boyfriends all said, 'You spend all the time at the office and don't love me.' I never have to justify myself to Jérôme, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.""

Marant is quite content to have those conversations with herself. In recent years, she has mined Americana for her collections—surf, cowgirl, Elvis, Navajo theme, with studs and grommets galore—but her fall/<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winter 2013 collection</span> was a staid departure. What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. ""I had a kind of sadness,"" she says. ""I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.""

Tomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: ""I <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,"" she says. ""I love cooking—all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans."" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: ""If you have a nice house outside of Paris,"" she explains, ""you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""

She is still seeking to find that balance in her business—although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> ""I don't want to be on every corner. If I open everywhere, then it becomes common. I don't want to overflow the world with Isabel Marant.""
