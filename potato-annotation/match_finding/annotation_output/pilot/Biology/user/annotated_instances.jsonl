Under the influence of osanetant, mice could still learn to become afraid of a sound paired with a shock, but the mice did not freeze as much in response to the sound a day later, even if the drug was given an hour after training. Thus, the trauma and its circumstances are remembered but the consolidation of fear memories is impaired, which could decrease the likelihood of developing fear-related disorders,  Andero says.\">Under the influence of osanetant, mice could still learn to become afraid of a sound paired with a shock, but the mice did not freeze as much in response to the sound a day later, even if the drug was given an hour after training.</span> </div><div name=\"instance_text\" style=\"float:left;width:50%;padding:5px;\" class=\"column\"> <legend> Paper </legend> <span data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Finally, one of the most interesting aspects of our data is the potential use of the Nk3R antagonist osanetant as a pharmacological agent to block fear memory consolidation shortly after exposure to a trauma. Additionally, we found that osanetant prevented the upregulation of the Adcyap1r1 gene, which encodes the PAC1 receptor. All this could be relevant in PTSD prevention since it has previously been found that osanetant is safe in humans, although additional preclinical studies, such as those described herein, are needed first to establish the mechanisms involved.\">Additionally, we found that osanetant prevented the upregulation of the Adcyap1r1 gene, which encodes the PAC1 receptor.</span> </div> </div>", "label_annotations": {"The information conveyed in the findings is": {"Completely different": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 2s "}}
