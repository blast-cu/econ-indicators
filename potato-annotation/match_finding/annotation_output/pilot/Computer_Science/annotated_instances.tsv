Other key findings from the study:

Charging for the first or second checked bag improved on-time departure performance for all major airlines--including Southwest Airlines, which does not charge for the first two bags--because it creates savings due to a cultural shift among US passengers to travel with less baggage. This shift resulted in a lower demand for airport labor-intensive, back-end operations such as baggage handling and security checks, which are shared resources across airlines."">Other key findings from the study:

We also identify the differential impact of baggage fees on 'low-cost' versus 'legacy' carriers: the departure performance of the low-cost airlines became worse while it improved for the legacy carriers when charging for one checked bag. When the airlines began charging for two checked bags, we find no significant change in departure performance of legacy carriers, but a degradation of departure performance of low-cost carriers."">We also identify the differential impact of baggage fees on 'low-cost' versus 'legacy' carriers: the departure performance of the low-cost airlines became worse while it improved for the legacy carriers when charging for one checked bag.</span> </div> </div>"					2

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that on very small scales there is actually a whole family of 'second laws', which can lead to unexpected and counterintuitive phenomena.  Even while individual parts of a system may become more ordered, the overall entropy of the total system (a measure of disorder) increases.

Interpreted strictly, the Clausius statement of the second law, applies to situations which never occur in nature. The same holds true for other versions of the second law, such as the Kelvin-Planck statement, where one also talks about cyclic processes, in which all other objects beside the system of interest are returned back to their original state."">Interpreted strictly, the Clausius statement of the second law, applies to situations which never occur in nature.</span> </div> </div>"			4
