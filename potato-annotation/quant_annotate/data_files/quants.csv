96827_36,"EU officials say that if the U.K. settles on an agreement before the extension ends, it could leave the EU at an earlier date. Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com, Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com  87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8  Appeared in the March 15,<span> 2019,</span> print edition as 'U.K. Parliament Postpones Brexit'."
96827_34,"If the agreement has by then been rejected a third time, then a much longer extension could follow. Donald Tusk, who as president of the European Council presides over EU summits, tweeted on Thursday that he would push leaders to consider a long extension “if the U.K. finds it necessary to rethink its #Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.”  The formal argument for a long extension—possibly one of more <span>than 12 months</span>—is that it would give U.K. politicians time to build a firm consensus on Brexit and allow both sides more time to prepare for Britain’s departure. Mr. Tusk is also aware, officials say, that such a lengthy extension could open up new approaches, heightening the pressure on the strongly pro-Brexit wing of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party to accept the deal at hand."
96827_31,"An amendment to allow lawmakers to take control over the Brexit process from the government failed by just two votes on Thursday. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn repeated his demand for a second Brexit referendum, calling for “a public vote, not as political point-scoring but as a realistic option to break the deadlock.”  With that, Mr. Barclay countered, Mr. Corbyn was “shredding the votes <span>of 17.4 million</span> people in this country,” a reference to the slim majority of Britons who expressed support for Brexit in the June 2016 referendum. Mrs. May’s hope is that the threat of a long delay will encourage several dozen hard-line anti-EU lawmakers to swallow their objections and support it."
96827_30,"With Parliament imposing serial defeats on the prime minister, she is struggling to keep her lawmakers and even some members of her cabinet on her side. The greatest share of those opposing the motion to delay—188 <span>of 202 votes</span>—were members of her own party. An amendment to allow lawmakers to take control over the Brexit process from the government failed by just two votes on Thursday."
96827_29,"“It is time to act in the national interest.”  The government’s motion to delay Brexit by at least three months passed on Thursday by 412 votes to 202. The <span>other 27 EU</span> governments must unanimously agree to any extension, a matter they will consider at a summit in Brussels that starts next Thursday. Mrs. May’s room for maneuver is shrinking fast."
