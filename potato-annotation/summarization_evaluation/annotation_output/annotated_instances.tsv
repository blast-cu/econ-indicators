user	1	"<strong>Document: </strong>KYIV, Ukraine — Russia blasted the Ukrainian capital with a deadly wave of “kamikaze” drones Monday, in a renewed attack that set apartments ablaze as soldiers fired into the air.

The drones, carrying explosives and their distinctive buzz, terrorized Kyiv just a week after the Kremlin’s forces unleashed a deadly barrage against civilian and infrastructure targets across the country.

Ukraine said the attacks included Iranian-made drones, which it has accused Moscow of increasingly deploying as it runs low on precision missiles, and appealed again for Western allies to provide aerial defensive help.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has escalated his strikes on Ukrainian cities in the wake of a series of battlefield setbacks that have weakened his military’s grip on territory Moscow claims to have annexed, as well as the Kremlin’s hold over the mood at home.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said ""kamikaze"" drones caused five explosions that rocked the city in the early morning hours Monday. One of them hit a residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, he said.
