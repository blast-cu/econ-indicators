If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.\n\nThere were more than 505,000 apprentices in training in fiscal year 2016, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level on record back to 2001, but only about 20,000 higher than the previous peak in 2003.

Rather, the president\u2019s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common. But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.\n\nOf the more than 8,000 active apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry and 20% are in manufacturing. However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.\n\nApprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration.
