84464,"The president, who hosted NBC’s reality television show ‘The Apprentice,’ will announce an expansion of apprenticeship programs

June 10, 2017 2:00 pm ET

President Donald Trump next week will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.

Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. Nine in 10 Americans who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary is $60,000 a year, according to the Labor Department.

The administration is committed to “supporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,” Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and assistant, said Friday. “There has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.""

White House officials discussing the president’s goals on Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress. They said Mr. Trump is likely to offer more specifics in the coming days. He plans to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer, which federal or state governments certify. Workers are trained for skills businesses need and provided hands-on experience. Since workers are paid while they learn, programs can attract younger Americans seeking to avoid student debt and displaced older workers who need new skills but can’t attend years of college.

Such programs could also address an emerging shortage of skilled workers. There were more than six million job openings in April, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end of 2000. At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.

“Closing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,” Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday. If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they’re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.

There were more than 505,000 apprentices in training in fiscal year 2016, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level on record back to 2001, but only about 20,000 higher than the previous peak in 2003. And the figure is much smaller than the 13.3 million students enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Before running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC’s reality television show “The Apprentice.” A senior White House official said the show didn’t inspire the policy push. Rather, the president’s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common. But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.

Of the more than 8,000 active apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry and 20% are in manufacturing. However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.

Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. The Labor Department distributed $90 million in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion. The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they’re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.

Mr. Trump’s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by nearly 40%.

“Continuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,” said Seth Harris, the deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama. “Those cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.”

Many large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.

Defense firm Northrop Grumman has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive Wes Bush said businesses need the government’s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don’t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.

“Our nation’s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today’s workers,” he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday. “Unfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.”

15014,"Political experts weigh economy's impact on midterm elections amid 'bad economic policies'
The US inflation rate hit 8.6% in May, a new 40-year high
The economy has taken a massive tumble in recent months and some political experts are questioning just how much it will impact the upcoming midterm elections in November as inflation soars to its highest rate in four decades and gas prices reach record highs.
The U.S. inflation rate of 8.3% was among the highest in the developed world in April and May, far out-pacing Japan, France, Germany, the U.K., Italy and Canada. President Biden's administration has scrambled to find an answer to inflation and spiking gas prices, which remain near $5 per gallon nationally.
To better understand how the economy will impact the elections, or whether it will at all, Fox News Digital contacted four political experts to get their assessment.
GROCERY SHOPPERS MAKING ‘DRAMATIC SHIFT’ AWAY FROM NATIONAL BRANDS AMID INFLATION, SUPERMARKET CHAIN SAYS
Tulsi Gabbard, former U.S. congresswoman from Hawaii and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate:
""I think the most important thing is that Americans across the country are looking for solutions. People are already struggling right now, tremendously, because of inflation, because of rising gas prices. People don't feel safe in their own communities. You know, the value of the dollar is dropping as things get more and more expensive and people are having a hard time making ends meet. I think what they're looking for, regardless of political party, are leaders who are going to bring solutions and actually take action to start to address these problems.
""I'm sitting here in Washington, D.C., right now and very cognizant of the reality about how disconnected most of our political leaders are from that struggle and that frustration reality that Americans across the country are already facing. … When people hear messages coming from the White House like ‘We may be entering a recession, but it’s really not gonna be that bad,' things are already bad. Things are already difficult for a lot of people and it just further increases their lack of faith and confidence that people in Washington even know what they're going through when they hear statements like that. People want solutions, so that is what they'll be looking for now, and as we go forward.
""There is way too much focus on quote-unquote messaging, or changing the messaging, or improving the messaging, or the narrative. What does that have to do with reality? You can say things are gonna be different or better, but unless people are actually seeing action, unless people are actually seeing steps forward towards progress and solving these challenges, all they will continue to hear is a lot of lip service…""
Kellyanne Conway, former presidential campaign manager and former White House counselor to President Trump:
""When it comes to the economy, Democrats want you to believe not what you see, but what they say. You see skyrocketing prices; they say 'I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle'; it's ‘transitory’ and a ‘high class problem’ that is ‘caused by’ COVID and ‘has everything to do with the supply chain.’
""Inflation and fears of recession have battered household finances and threatened overall stability and personal savings. U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in early June and fell to the lowest level on record, matched by the highest inflation numbers in 40 years. Recent polls from Fox News and CNN tell the same tale of woe: well over three-quarters of Americans rate the economy as somewhat or very poor; that includes 81% of Independents and 76% of women. Biden blames Putin for American inflation; Americans blame Biden.
""The contrast of the Trump economy and Biden economy couldn't be more stark. Inflation was low, wages were high, infant formula was on the grocery store shelves and gas was cheap. There is a way out. A growing number of nervous voters know it was much better not that long ago and they want that back.
""Republican leaders and candidates and other influencers must articulate and present policies that benefit the job creator, the job seeker and the job holder. These include unleashing energy independence, lowering tax burdens, ending the regulatory assault on American businesses and workers, enforcing fair and reciprocal trade deals, and building supply chains that put Americans to work-and put America first.""
CONSUMER'S DRIVE TO KEEP ‘MARCHING FORWARD’ WILL SOON BE ‘QUITE DIFFICULT’: FORMER ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR
Brandon Arnold, executive vice president at the National Taxpayers Union (NTU):
""Regardless of what Secretary Yellen claims, we are heading toward a recession. The real question is not if it will happen but how severe it will be. It’s a similar situation for Democrats in the upcoming election. It’s not a question of whether or not they are going to lose, it’s a question of how severe their losses will be.
""Obviously, these situations are highly interrelated. Bad economic policies from Congressional Democrats and President Biden have turned tough economic circumstances into an absolute disaster that will manifest itself at the ballot box in November. If Democrats are able to salvage any positives – like holding onto the Senate – they are going to need unforced errors by GOP candidates and a very shallow recession.
""Meanwhile, Republicans only need to keep the focus on economic issues while avoiding any major gaffes.""
Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary for George W. Bush & Fox News contributor:
""The Democrats are in big trouble, with or without a recession. But if there is a recession, many Democrats in safe seats will lose. Recessions are devastating to the public, but they’re even more devastating to politicians, especially those in the party in power.""
