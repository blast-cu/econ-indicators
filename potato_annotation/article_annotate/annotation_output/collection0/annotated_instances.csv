Republicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene. A top House Democrat announced the chamber will vote Thursday to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments.
The House will vote on stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee roles as G.O.P. weighs her future.
The House will vote Thursday on whether to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, a top Democrat announced, forcing congressional Republicans to take a public stand on the Georgia freshman who endorsed conspiracy theories and calls to execute Democratic politicians before she was elected.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 Democrat</span>, said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, and that “it is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Representative Greene from her committee assignments.”
House Democrats, incensed by a series of social media posts made by Ms. Greene before she won her seat in November, threatened earlier this week that they would take the unusual step of moving unilaterally to remove Ms. Greene from the education and budget committees if Republicans themselves did not take action.</span> Party leaders generally have authority over who represents them on committees.
The vote will make Republicans go on the record for the first time on whether Ms. Greene should be rebuked for her past comments.
While most Republican lawmakers have privately been horrified by her rhetoric, some have argued that members of Congress should not face punishment for remarks they made before they were elected, and that allowing one party (in this case, Democrats) to take unilateral action against a lawmaker in another party would set a dangerous precedent. Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene’s side.
Mr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference’s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.
A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer’s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would “address this with members later today.”
Mr. Hoyer’s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber. They are also expected to discuss the turmoil around Ms. Greene.
Supporters of Mr. Trump want to strip Ms. Cheney of her leadership post as payback for her vote to impeach the former president. And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.
Ms. Greene’s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.
Ms. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to “rush an emergency donation” to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $160,000 in</span> one day.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Biden says he won’t drop his ‘promise’ <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1,400 stimulus</span> checks, but is open to further targeting them.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">President Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he would not agree to scale back <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,400 direct</span> payments to many Americans that are a centerpiece of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $1.9 trillion</span> stimulus package, but would consider restricting them to lower-income individuals as Republicans have proposed.
</span>“We can’t walk away from an <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $1,400 in</span> direct checks, because people need it,” Mr. Biden told the lawmakers on a private conference call, according to two people who participated. “I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to people.”
But he added: “We can better target the number — I’m OK with that.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden’s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president’s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.
</span>“We need to act fast,” Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. “It’s about who the hell we are as a country.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some Republicans have argued that the next round of stimulus checks should go to Americans most in need.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Biden’s plan, the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">full $1,400 payment</span> would be limited to individuals earning no more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75,000 a</span> year, but those with higher incomes would receive smaller checks.
</span>The president’s signal that he was open to compromise on the matter came a couple of days after he met at the White House <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 10 Republican</span> senators who are seeking <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $618 billion</span> package they said could win bipartisan backing. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their proposal calls for checks of up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,000 that</span> would go only to individuals earning less <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $50,000 a</span> year, with the full payment limited to those whose annual income <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $40,000 or</span> below.
</span>Later, Mr. Biden met separately at the White House with Senate Democrats and again discussed narrowing eligibility for the checks.
“We did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they’re targeted,” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">On the call with House Democrats, Mr. Biden said he was “not married to a particular, absolute number” on the overall stimulus package.
</span>“We can make compromises on several of the programs,” he told them, adding, “we have to take care of the people who are hurting.”
As for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call that that was “not in the cards.”

Senate Democrats will assume chairmanships of committees under a power-sharing deal with Republicans.
Senate Democrats will take control of the chamber’s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.
The lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden’s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.
“I’m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,” Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Senate’s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell’s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.
</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided. It will allow equal party representation on committees but in the cases of tie votes, legislation or nominees will still advance to the floor for consideration.
Though the Senate is split 50-50, Democrats are in control by virtue of the power of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. The formal organizing resolution is expected to be considered later Wednesday.
Brian Sicknick, the officer who died from the Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span>, is honored in a ceremony at the Capitol he helped protect.
In the same room that rioters stormed last month, lawmakers gathered in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday for a memorial service to honor Brian D. Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the Jan.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 attack</span>.
Mr. Sicknick is the fifth person to lie in honor in the Capitol, a distinction reserved for private citizens, while government officials, like former presidents, lie in state.
“Blessed are the peacekeepers like Brian,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said during the ceremony. “Let us be the peacekeepers now in his memory.”
Mr. Sicknick’s family, lawmakers and other top officials attended the ceremony, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who also spoke; the Republican leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California; Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington. Before the service, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also paid their respects.
Mr. Sicknick’s remains were delivered to the Capitol on Tuesday evening, passing through a set of doors still shattered from the events of Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Officers from his unit, some on mountain bikes, lined up near the steps outside.
Minutes later, President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, departed the White House to pay their respects.
“We must be vigilant, as what President Lincoln referred to as the harsh artillery of time, we will never forget,” Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday during the ceremony near a table where Mr. Sicknick’s remains and an American flag were placed. “Each day when members enter the Capitol, this temple of democracy, we will remember his sacrifice and then others that day who fought so hard to protect the Capitol and the Congress.”
Walking out of the rotunda after the service, Representatives Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, and Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, paid their final respects side by side.
At <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 14 other</span> Capitol Police officers were injured in the attack, according to a memo issued by the F.B.I. Two police officers who responded to the siege have since died by suicide.
“Knowing our personal tragedy and loss is shared by our nation brings hope for healing,” Mr. Sicknick’s partner, Sandra Garza, and his family said in a statement.
As he left the Capitol for the final time, Mr. Sicknick was met by rows of officers, saluting the hearse that drove his remains to Arlington National Cemetery.

The Justice Dept. drops a lawsuit accusing Yale of discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants.
The Justice Department on Wednesday withdrew a lawsuit against Yale that charged the university with discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants for admission, another reversal by the new administration of a Trump-era policy.
The Trump administration had made race-based college admissions a target, and today’s action suggests the Biden administration may be prepared to retreat from that policy.
Supporters of the Trump administration’s lawsuit assert that Asian-Americans and whites are being held to higher admissions standards at a number of elite colleges. <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> a federal judge rejected claims that Harvard had intentionally discriminated against Asian-American applicants, but the plaintiffs are expected to file a petition to the Supreme Court.
“Yale is gratified that the U.S. Justice Department has dropped its lawsuit challenging Yale College’s admissions practices,” Karen N. Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Our admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.”
The “notice of voluntary dismissal” of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department’s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.
In a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit “in light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,” including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard’s admissions practices.
But the department said that it would continue an “underlying investigation” to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.
The Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.
“It is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,” said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. “Using race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.”
The lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The government said that race was the “determinative factor” in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that “for the great majority of applicants,” Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.
Violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.
Yale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration’s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.
Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.
She and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump’s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
If Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for “incitement of insurrection.”
At home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It’s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere — beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.
At least one conservative state lawmaker — who described the impeachment vote as “an ice pick in the back” by Republicans who supported it — has printed “Impeach Liz Cheney!” yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.
People close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country’s electoral system.
As she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called “the big lie,” Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump’s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.
Her allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.
“The beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,” said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. “So the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it’s only helping Democrats.”
Some Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden’s immigration policies.
After a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden’s order to pause deportations <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president’s new tone.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.
“This is not what the Biden administration stands for,” Henry Hollithron, the man’s lawyer, said in an interview. “That is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.”
President Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a “deep state” inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws.
Mr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.
Videos celebrating Mr. Trump’s “big, beautiful” border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump’s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol’s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents — whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump — has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration’s reversals of his policies.
Those agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump’s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The day before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE’s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.
</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden’s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.

WASHINGTON — More <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators — in some cases their own bosses — to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent “attack on our workplace” that threatened the peaceful transition of power.
In a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who “smashed” their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his “baseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">“As congressional employees, we don’t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,” they wrote.</span> “And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.”
A copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate’s impeachment trial.
The letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump’s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the “incitement of insurrection” he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials’ behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views — much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.
The House <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.
The House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.
The provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.
“Given the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,” Ms. Pelosi said. “It is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span>”
The vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.
During a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.
“These words and actions raise serious safety concerns,” Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors “a basic safety measure.”
Ms. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines “unconstitutional.”

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 6</span>:59 pm ET

The Biden administration is moving forward on a plan to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a policy that would upend <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $95 billion</span> U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions of people to quit smoking.

The plan, unveiled Tuesday as part of the administration’s agenda of regulatory actions, likely wouldn’t take effect for several years. The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2023,</span> though the agency cautioned that date could change. Then the agency would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue, which could further delay the policy’s implementation.

“Nicotine is powerfully addictive,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement Tuesday. “Lowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit.”

The move would be the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998,</span> when tobacco companies agreed to pay more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 billion</span> to help states pay for healthcare. As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to various marketing restrictions, including a ban on free product samples and advertising on billboards.

The cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 when</span> the pandemic hit. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 12.5% of</span> adults in the U.S., <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 30.8 million</span> people, were cigarette smokers <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. cigarette sales are expected to drop this year to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $95 billion</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $99 billion</span> last year, according to Euromonitor International.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The policy would apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S. Imports of traditional cigarettes would be barred but multinational tobacco companies could continue to sell full-nicotine cigarettes in other countries.</span> New Zealand’s Ministry of Health also has proposed a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes to very low levels as part of a broader plan to curb smoking.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The FDA’s planned rule could sharply decrease U.S. cigarette sales, and tobacco companies intend to fight it.</span> The largest U.S. cigarette makers—Altria Group Inc. <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MO 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle and Reynolds American Inc.—sell alternative products such as nicotine pouches, but revenue for both companies comes predominantly from cigarettes.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Altria shares at market close Tuesday had fallen <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 7% since</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10,</span> when The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration planned to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes.

</span>Reynolds and Altria said Tuesday that encouraging smokers to switch to less harmful options was a better approach to improving public health than reducing nicotine in cigarettes.

“We do actually support the overarching goal here, which is to transition smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free products,” said Murray Garnick, Altria’s general counsel. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We just think that the better way is to create a robust market of FDA-authorized smoke-free products.”

Mr. Garnick said that the policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels wasn’t achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year.</span> If the policy were effective, he said, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.

Nicotine is the addictive chemical that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn’t cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.

The FDA’s nicotine-reduction plan is based on more than a decade of government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Smokers of these cigarettes were more likely to quit or seek their nicotine fix from less-harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes or gum compared with smokers who continued using regular cigarettes.

Cigarette smoking is the most dangerous way to consume nicotine, according to public health officials. While very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive, researchers say, their smoke still contains most of the same carcinogenic compounds as regular cigarette smoke.

According to an FDA study published <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> such a rule would prompt an <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 13 million</span> adult smokers to quit within five years of implementation.

Smoking is linked to more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 480,000 deaths</span> in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And tobacco use costs <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $300 billion</span> a year in direct healthcare and lost productivity, the FDA says.

</span>Cigarette industry executives say the science on low-nicotine cigarettes isn’t conclusive. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">They say that such a rule would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and could lead to consumer confusion around the health risks of very low-nicotine cigarettes.</span> There is widespread misunderstanding in the U.S. about the health risks of nicotine. An FDA study <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 found</span> that <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75% of</span> people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine caused cancer.

Big cigarette companies also say it would take years for them to develop a very low-nicotine cigarette and that it wouldn’t be feasible to manufacture at scale. In the past, tobacco companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. In anticipation of a federal nicotine-reduction rule, Altria and Reynolds have experimented with other ways, including tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.

22nd Century Group Inc., <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">XXII 3.33</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical tobacco plant for a cigarette brand called VLN. The product is currently available for sale in Chicago. Through a federal contract, 22nd Century has also supplied more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 million</span> cigarettes at varying nicotine levels for scientific research.

22nd Century is willing to partner with other cigarette companies to provide tobacco seeds, Chief Executive James Mish said. “It’s immediately scalable,” he said.

Lowering nicotine in cigarettes has been a subject of discussion inside the FDA since the 1990s. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the agency the authority to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes, but only if the policy was based on scientific evidence, a caveat that slowed the process for years. The law stipulated that the FDA couldn’t eliminate nicotine in cigarettes entirely.

Scott Gottlieb, who served as an FDA commissioner during the Trump administration, pursued a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes as part of a broader tobacco policy he proposed <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> But after he left the agency <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> Trump administration officials shelved the plan.

The Biden administration decided to embrace the policy as part of President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative, which aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 50% over</span> the <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 25 years</span>. His administration is also pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which account for more than a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The FDA published a proposed rule on menthols in April and is now soliciting public comments. That ban also likely wouldn’t take effect for several years.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Separately, the FDA is conducting a review of all e-cigarettes on the market and weighing whether their potential benefit as a less-harmful alternative for adult cigarette smokers outweighs the products’ risk to young people.

Health officials are learning more about the deadly pathogen behind the continuing pandemic
Scientists and public-health officials are learning more about the new coronavirus behind a continuing pandemic. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.
What are the symptoms of Covid-19?
The virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.
The Latest on the Coronavirus
- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 114,000
</span>- U.S. cases <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">passes 22,000
</span>- What we know about the coronavirus
Some people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don’t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:
• Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath
• Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
• Bluish lips or face
What should I do if I develop symptoms?
If you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.
Isolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.
How worried should I be?
Most people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But “mild” can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you’ll have to be isolated or quarantined.
By not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.
<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.
Public-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn’t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren’t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.
I’m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?
The new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.
Is taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?
Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn’t a cure and won’t prevent you from infecting others.
I’ve heard I shouldn’t take ibuprofen. Is that true?
There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn’t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn’t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.
Is there a test?
Yes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.
Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.
What if I have to self-isolate?
If you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.’s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don’t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.
Don’t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.
Are there drugs to treat coronaviruses?
There aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.’s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.
Two clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.
How do I keep from getting Covid-19?
Schools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending—and in some cases, requiring—that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.
Who is most at risk?
Adults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8% in</span> people <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 70 to</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 79,</span> compared with <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.
Are my children at risk?
Few children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 and</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.
How at risk is someone in the U.S.?
Covid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.
The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.
Public-health officials hope to “flatten the curve” of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That’s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.

How is the virus spread among humans?
It transmits through “respiratory droplets” when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, according to the WHO. The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person’s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.
Respiratory droplets are heavy and don’t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.
Scientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.
How long can the virus survive on surfaces?
It can last up <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.
The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.
Wipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.
Can face masks protect you?
Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings—even a bandanna or scarf will do—in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.
Cloth masks or coverings don’t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren’t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn’t be used on children <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.
What else can I do to protect myself?
The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth—viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.
Is it safe to travel internationally?
The State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.
Can I donate blood?
The CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. “Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,” said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.
To minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.
Going back to basics: What is a coronavirus?
This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.
Seven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
This new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)
How deadly is it?
The overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span> <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won’t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.
The mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.
The overall mortality rate may be less <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.
That is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.1%.</span>
Covid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen—SARS, which erupted in China <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.
But this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.
How Effective Are Masks?
The World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.

How easily does the virus spread?
Disease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.5 and</span><span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 to</span><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 other</span> people.
Public-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
Experts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.
What is the incubation period?
People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 11.5 days</span>.
Can you get infected after you have already had the disease?
That isn’t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.
Can you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?
Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance—6 feet or more—from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.
Where did the new coronavirus come from?
The new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.

By Natalie Sherman
Business reporter, New York
- Published
The US central bank has pushed interest rates to the highest level in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 15 years</span> as it fights to rein in soaring prices in the world's largest economy.
</span>The Federal Reserve announced it was raising its key rate by <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 0.75 percentage</span> points, lifting the target range <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.25%.</span>
Borrowing costs are expected to climb more - and remain high, the bank said.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The move comes despite mounting concern that the cost of controlling inflation could be a harsh economic downturn.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the rate rises were necessary to slow demand, easing the pressures putting up prices and avoiding long-term damage to the economy.</span> But he conceded that they will take a toll.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">""We have got to get inflation behind us,"" he said.</span> ""I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""
Banks in nearly every country - with the big exceptions of Japan and China - are facing similar trade-offs as they raise rates to combat their own inflation problems.
</span>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce its seventh consecutive rate rise at its meeting on Thursday, while Indonesia and the Philippines are among the other countries also poised for increases.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Analysts are starting to worry that the global sweep of the rate hikes, which ripple out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, loans and credit card debt, could lead to greater economic slowdown than policymakers expect.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Even if it avoids the two quarters of contraction that typically define a recession, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2023 world</span> economy is expected to be at its weakest in more than a decade, excepting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 pandemic</span> year, said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">""What has become clear is that if given the choice between allowing inflation to remain high for a sustained period .... or pushing the economy into a recession, [central bank leaders] would rather push the economy into recession and get inflation back towards target,"" he said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">How much will interest rates go up?
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the US, the Fed is raising rates at one of the fastest paces in its modern history, a sharp reversal after years of low borrowing costs, responding to inflation that is running at a 40-year high.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed initially hoped that the problems would fade as supply chain issues tied to the coronavirus pandemic abated.</span> But the war in Ukraine, which disrupted oil and good supplies, added to the problem.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while oil prices have since come down, inflation pressures are now bubbling across the economy, with the most recent data showing inflation <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3% in</span> August, with big increases in housing, health care and education costs.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Wages, while rising, have not kept pace, hurting household budgets.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Wednesday's rate increase - the fifth in a row - lifts the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow from near zero at the start of the year <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% for</span> the first time since <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect it to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 4.4% by</span> the end of the year - and rise further <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023,</span> sharply higher than its prior forecasts.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">""What is striking is the speed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.</span> ""They're having to move very quickly ... and it means it's more likely to be a surprise to firms and households.<span id=""16"" class=""red"">""
Uncertainty weighs heavily
New Yorker Sean V said he felt lucky that he bought a two-bedroom condo last year, before borrowing costs started their climb, locking in a mortgage rate <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2.6%.</span>
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">But the 30-year-old works in the home loan industry, which has seen business plunge as mortgage rates <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cross 6% for</span> the first time <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">He said he feared losing his job ""every single day"" and was cutting back spending and scrapping holiday plans amid the uncertainty.
</span>""I don't know <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what 2023 is</span> going to bring,"" he said. ""All of that weighs heavily - not just on me, on everybody.<span id=""19"" class=""red"">""
""I don't know how stalling the economy is helping anyone.</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">""
How do higher interest rates reduce inflation?
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Some inflation is seen as healthy, but sudden, sharp price spikes make it hard for households and businesses to plan and reduce spending power, hurting economic growth and eroding living standards over time.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">By raising borrowing costs for businesses and households, central banks intend to reduce demand for big-ticket items like cars, homes or business expansions, which should ease the pressures pushing up prices.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But it also means less economic activity, which typically leads to job losses and other economic pain.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">In the US, where the economy contracted in the first half of the year, home sales have slumped and growing numbers of firms have instituted job cuts or hiring freezes, warning of rising costs and slowdown ahead.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">For now, the US jobs market has shown few signs of slowdown, helping to keep consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - resilient.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But pressure has been rising on the Fed.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, prominent progressive senator, Elizabeth Warren, called the Fed's moves ""extreme"".
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I've been warning that Chair Powell's Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work - and I fear he's already on the path to doing so,"" she wrote on Twitter.
</span>Will rate rises lead to a recession?
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed show policymakers expect growth in the US to slow to a crawl this year, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.2%.</span></span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">They see growth picking up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.2% next</span> year, but predict the unemployment rate will rise <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.4%.</span>
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The forecasts do not show inflation returning to the bank'<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2025.</span>
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr Powell said doing less could lead to even more economic damage.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">""Higher interest rates, slower growth and a softening labour market are all painful for the public that we serve but they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and and do it down the road again,"" he said.

DENVER—The Federal Reserve will soon increase its purchases of short-term Treasury securities to avoid a recurrence of the unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Fed officials stopped shrinking the assets on their balance sheet in August but never said when they would allow the balance sheet to grow again.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">As a result, a crucial liability on the balance sheet—bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves—has continued declining.

Stresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn’t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“That time is now upon us,” Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell didn’t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Reserves dropped to less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates—and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2008 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.

</span>“This is not QE,” Mr. Powell said. “In no sense is this QE.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed’s plan hasn’t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials’</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the “repo” market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16 and</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">With more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions—if allowed to fester—could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September’s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Market analysts said Mr. Powell’s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed’s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“This was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,” said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Fed’s next policy meeting is several weeks away “and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,” Mr. Powell said.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Despite the Fed’s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.

</span>“It’s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn’t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,” he said.

65d3958a8a5c879c9f684b9d,87390,"<h3>Fixed mortgage rates are back down to February lows after sharp decline in bond yields and removal of unpopular refinance fee</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 80 lenders</span> nationwide to come up with weekly national averages.</span> It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with high credit scores and large down payments. Because of the criteria, these rates are not available to every borrower.
The survey is based on home purchase mortgages. Rates for refinances may be different.
The 15-year fixed-rate average decreased <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.12 percent</span> with an <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 0.7 point</span>. It <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 2.22 percent</span> a week ago <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.54 percent</span> a year ago.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Mortgage rates fell sharply this week to their lowest level in months,” said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist.</span> “Less than a year after initially announcing it, the organization that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said last week that they would remove a policy that places an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 50 basis</span> point fee on mortgages that are being refinanced,” he added. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The program was intended to protect mortgage lenders from pandemic-driven losses, but it ultimately made it more expensive for homeowners to refinance their home loan and artificially increased the average mortgage rate.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rates immediately fell sharply on the announcement, a move that was extended later in the week as mounting concerns about the delta variant of covid-19 and its potential impact on expected economic growth led many investors to sell off stocks and seek the safe haven of bonds.”
</span>Borrowers wanting to refinance their mortgages received good news late last week. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that it was doing away with the adverse market refinance fee as of Aug.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span> The unpopular surcharge on refinances was announced last summer but not put in place until December. It was intended to offset covid-related losses suffered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The adjustment, which applied only to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinances, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.5 percent</span> of the loan amount. That added <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,500 to</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $300,000 loan</span>. According to FHFA data,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72 percent</span> of refinances were acquired by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2018 through</span> the first half <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“With less <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> of GSE loans in forbearance and continued home price appreciation resulting in significant borrower equity, there is no need for the fee,” said Bob Broeksmit, president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, suggested that borrowers would be wise to call several lenders before refinancing.
</span>“Lenders may use this as an opportunity to pad their own margins that have been squeezed by low rates and heated competition, so it is important for homeowners to seek out the lenders offering the best terms,” he said.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Monday’s dramatic stock market sell-off had investors fleeing to the safety of bonds, pushing prices up and yields down.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which started the month at<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>48 percent, plummeted to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>19 percent on Monday.</span> It rebounded to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>3 percent on Wednesday, back nearly to where it was on Friday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“A declining stock market, foreign demand for U.S. debt and the need for portfolio rebalancing by institutional players have all come together to bid up the price of 10-year Treasurys,” said Ken H. Johnson, a real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“This increased demand has pushed down 10-year yields significantly to levels that no one anticipated.”
Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that more than two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to go down in the coming week.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“Interest rates should ease lower with the lifting late last week of the adverse market fee and the drop in the 10-year Treasury after the Fed once again reinforced inflation as transitory,” said Gordon Miller, owner of Miller Lending Group.</span> “New concerns about the covid variant globally have also raised concerns of continued growth being slower than expected, so a return to the lows for the year [is] quite possible in the weeks ahead.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, mortgage applications slumped last week.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">decreased 4 percent</span> from a week earlier.</span> The refinance index <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3 percent</span>, while the purchase index <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 6 percent</span>. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 64.9 percent</span> of applications.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“On a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the July 4th holiday week, mortgage applications were lower across the board, with purchase applications back to near their lowest levels since <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2020,</span>” Joel Kan, an MBA economist, said in a statement.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Limited inventory and higher prices are keeping some prospective home buyers out of the market.</span> Refinance activity fell over the week, but because rates have stayed relatively low, the pace of applications was close to its highest level since early May.”

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon’s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.
Given a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? “It seemed kind of rude,” Hirasuna said. “Like, ‘Hey, here I am!’ ” A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. “It was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,” he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity — to do work he might actually like — in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.
Offices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.
And then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision — hover outside the boss’s office? don’t hover? — poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“When it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,” said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> “It’s moving in the dark without a flashlight.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show “Survivor.”</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as “autistic.” Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as “on the spectrum” or as “a person with autism.” “Just don’t call me late for dinner,” said one who did not have a preference.)
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues’ needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.
</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, “essentially to see if I can break it,” as Hirasuna put it.
<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children’s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, “that they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon’s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist’s start-up.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon’s marketing material names “pattern recognition” and “uncompromised honesty” as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations — even stereotypes — in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon’s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. “I realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don’t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,” he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? “ ‘That’s autism!’ ” Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. “ ‘O.K. — that’s what we expected!’ ”
One morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon’s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. “Oh, it drives my husband crazy, too,” she assured him. “But it helps me concentrate.” <span id=""20"" class=""red"">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)
</span>Musayaf’s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. “O.K.,” he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.
Later, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. “I knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,” she wrote. “We understand and respect each other.”
Musayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague’s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.
Musayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla’s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. “Look,” he said, “there is no correct way, or incorrect.” He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.
A culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam’s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.
</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But before she was put in charge of Auticon’s United States business in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2018,</span> she hadn’t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.
That Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening — they had been told to clear their desks — but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.
Another co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark’s founder), who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair would later prove popular — some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them — but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man’s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam’s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it’s pizza).
“People with my type of disorder, it’s not that we don’t have emotion,” Gadson said. “It’s that we have too much emotion. We can’t push that stuff back.”
Beam, as she started to understand the office’s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees’ boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems — a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum — call in to explain, in great detail, why they won’t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“You know, some employers would say to someone like that, ‘I’m done,’ ”</span> Beam said. “But I’m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.”
Beam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> “It was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious — I could see it — that he wasn’t able to process what it was he was being told,” she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">“I kind of like it here,” Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn’t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: “They accept me as I am.”
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.
</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. “Horus,” said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: “Halberd.” <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett’s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.
</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party — once. “It felt really claustrophobic,” he said. “I was like, O.K., I think I’ve had enough.” He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work — fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world’s worst meeting — interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.
The next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague — the one who had bristled in the meeting — that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: “I prefer this number:<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.87298334621.</span>” The note made her laugh, even though she wasn’t sure what it meant. “It’s the square root <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15,</span>” he told her. She burst out laughing again.
The conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. ”Don’t they look miserable?” Beam said. Kayla was indignant. “You know that at least some of them are introverts,” she said. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">It was almost as if they didn’t think their employees had feelings.

So what’s the deal? Will it ever happen?
That’s a very definite maybe.
In <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2014,</span> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the expanded playoffs to take effect in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>.
“I do believe it will be approved for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>[season],” Goodell said then.
[From May 2014: Roger Goodell expects the NFL to expand its playoffs beginning in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>]
He also said at that point: “I think we want to see one more year of, ‘Will it impact the regular season in a positive way from a competitive standpoint? Will it create more excitement, more races towards the end about who’s going to qualify for the playoffs?’ And we also want to absorb the additional inventory into the marketplace from an advertising standpoint. We’ll be able to do that. … So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that’s how we’re going to approach it.”
But then it didn’t happen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest.</span> And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.
[From February 2015: Support erodes for expanded NFL playoffs]
That doesn’t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It’s been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league’s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 CBA</span>.</span> The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players’ approval.
But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.
Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.
But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allowing 44 percent</span> of the league into the postseason rather than the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 38 percent</span>. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.
Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn’t mean that.
At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">either 17 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 games</span>, could be reconsidered, although the players’ approval remains the obvious obstacle there. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the expanded postseason could be reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The current labor deal runs <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2020,</span> and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.

1.</span></span> Seahawks say no to Kaepernick … The Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They’d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.
[Kaepernick-to-the-Seahawks made a lot of sense]<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
2.</span> Next for Kaepernick?… It now becomes a waiting game for Kaepernick. Teams are into their offseason programs and there is no catalyst, it seems, to prompt a signing sooner rather than later. It now appears likely that it will be at least into training camp before a team reconsiders its quarterback options and Kaepernick becomes an alternative somewhere.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span></span> What about RGIII?<span id=""4"" class=""red"">… If Kaepernick can’t get a job, are there any prospects for Robert Griffin III?</span> Could a team justify passing up Kaepernick, coming off a 16-touchdown, four-interception season in San Francisco, in favor of Griffin, coming off a two-touchdown, three-interception season in Cleveland?
Of course, teams justified signing quarterbacks such as Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Fitzpatrick instead of Kaepernick. So perhaps signing Griffin wouldn’t be too much of a stretch.<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Seahawks’ strife … The Seahawks have done their best to try to dismiss the report by ESPN The Magazine about internal strife stemming from cornerback Richard Sherman’s inability to let go of the ill-fated play call on the goal line that led to Wilson’s Super Bowl-losing interception against the New England Patriots. Fine. It probably won’t be an issue if the Seahawks have a successful season. But if things don’t go so well, it won’t be as easy for them to put this aside.
[Yes, it was the worst play call in Super Bowl history]<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
5.</span> Ravens’ OTA injuries … Injuries obviously are part of football. But nothing is worse than injuries occurring in offseason practices. The Baltimore Ravens have been particularly hard hit this offseason with the torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered by cornerback Tavon Young and the hip injury, reportedly career threatening, suffered by tight end Dennis Pitta. Little to nothing is won in the NFL during the offseason. But plenty can be lost.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">6. Offseason restrictions … Keep such injuries in mind the next time NFL coaches talk about the need to roll back some of the restrictions on offseason practices put in place in the last labor deal.</span> The NFL Players Association is very, very unlikely to agree to any rollbacks of those restrictions.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
7.</span> On Norman … Josh Norman’s recent comments to Bleacher Report about Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr. were relatively tame, by his standards. Norman can say what he wants. But, really, has he played well enough since moving from the Carolina Panthers to the Washington Redskins to justify such inflammatory remarks? Not really taking a stand on that. Just wondering.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
8.</span> On Cruz … Norman’s comments came nowhere close to those made recently by Victor Cruz, however, after the veteran wide receiver signed with the Chicago Bears.

This was a team that was starved for offensive production after a successful remake of its defense. If Cruz really believes that, he is deluding himself badly.

A Flying Elephant, a Teacher’s Hugs:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience
The virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.
As much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience — of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.
BRAZIL
“I am yearning for your hug. . .”
. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.
They had <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.
Students with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.
But the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.
Ms. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.
Her first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves — but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.
Then she came up with the idea of a pandemic “hugging kit” — disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.
The response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?
She rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.
“Distance can’t destroy what we have built,” Ms. Silva,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. “I needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I’m not able to hold them every morning.”
The kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon’s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.
Yasmim Vitória de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.
“She’s playful and she lets us have fun,” the 9-year-old said.
Ms. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.
“In a moment of tragedy, we’ve been able to share moments of love,” Ms. Silva said. “That is very powerful — Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni
INDIA
When India’s lockdown hit . . .
. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.
For years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India’s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.
When all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.
So Mr. Sahu,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn’t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.
“My mental condition was one of a mad person,” Mr. Sahu said. “When I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, ‘We have not eaten in days.’ It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.”
A spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.
When asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.
“Who else would take care of them?” he said. — Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj
ITALY
When an Italian bookstore appealed . . .
. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.
“We wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,” said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.
The idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers — and with luck a few volunteers — would read to people for <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. “We were thinking small,” she said.
But the response was overwhelming.
After the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.
Ms. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.
Ms. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she’d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.
In France, Paméla Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. “We managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,” Ms. Boittiaux said.
Ms. Romanese’s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.
“In a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,” she said. — Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden
BELARUS
When I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .
. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.
How he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country’s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk’s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.
</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. “All in all, I’m healthy and I’m free, which by today’s standards is quite something,” he said.
The doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.
Their authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.
But even as the president wouldn’t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing — a “people’s quarantine,” some called it.
One tech company, on Dr. Vitushka’s advice, bought <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.
After the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.
“All these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,” Dr. Vitushka told me. “And here we all came together in the face of a threat.”
For now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year’s pain — both for him and for his country — has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.
“We’re living through an intense coming-of-age period,” he said. “If I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.” — Anton Troianovski
CHINA
He has fostered more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .
. . . <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua’s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.
On Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.
Earlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week’s worth of food and water for their cats at home.
Please, they begged, could he help?
It was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city’s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.
But Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or “Old Cat,” did not hesitate.
“I just knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything,” he recalled. “It’s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.”
Almost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.
He wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.
<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats — and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.
“It was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,” Mr. Shuai said. “Looking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.”

Iran
The teacher had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .
. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.
For good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">children<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.
Some of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.
But Mr. Asadi,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> has <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.
“They told me, ‘You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher’s salary,’” Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. “But for me seeing the sweet smile on the children’s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.”
Overnight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.
He has also inspired others to act.
State-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.
</span>“Creating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,” Mr. Asadi said. — Farnaz Fassihi
BOLIVIA
The women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .
. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.
For months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women’s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn’t have to. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.
</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.
Sometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.
The death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.
“I wasn’t afraid to die,” she said. “Dying for me is a blessing, because I’m on the Lord’s path.” — Julie Turkewitz
CAMBODIA
When an elephant has to travel by plane. . .
. . . a lot of preparation is required.
It is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don’t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.
Now try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.
But on Nov.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.
Sent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.
Elephants are social creatures, and Kavaan’s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.
The trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.
Days before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.
Luckily, Kavaan’s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.
“2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,” said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, “and releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.” — Hannah Beech
KENYA
The calls and messages just kept coming . . .
. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi’s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food — or much of anything, really.
For many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.
Since it began, the project has raised more <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.
Ms. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.
“It changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,” Ms. Jaffar,<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. “There was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.”
But some parts of the story have been slower to change.
In April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.
“They didn’t stop until I said we were actually giving out food — ‘I am a community worker,’” she recalled.
Ms. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.
“We learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,” she said. — Abdi Latif Dahir
CHINA
She moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .
. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.
In late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.
Thousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hands 20 to</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.
Then, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor’s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor’s door.
That gave Ms. Guo an idea.
With friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.
She named her fledgling campaign “little vaccines against domestic violence,” and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.
Within hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag “little vaccines against domestic violence” has been viewed more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.
People across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.
The outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.
“Many people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,” Ms. Guo said, “but also because we’re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.”
Wuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.
</span>“It’s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,” she said. “So the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?” — Vivian Wang
<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MEXICO
2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .
. . . for Lucía Riojas Martínez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.
An outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.
But then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. “Remember what you have to do tomorrow,” she told herself.
At the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.
But lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country’s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.
And so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.
Ms. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn’t enough, that there was a “mental and emotional health crisis in the community,” she said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.
“More than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,” Ms. Riojas said.
Run largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
“Every day we know that the road gets harder, but we can’t take a step backward,” she said. “It’s forward — and it’s together.” — Oscar Lopez
BRITAIN
At <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .
. . . but now comes the reward.
In recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.
Then, the coronavirus came to Britain.
With older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard’s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.
For a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.
“It is frustrating because I live alone,” he said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“And you get fed up with your own company.”
</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.
Then, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.
“I was most surprised,” he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">day 1 of</span> Britain’s mass inoculation program. “I’ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.”
Mr. Pollard’s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. “Honestly, he’s my hero, nobody believes he’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 90,</span>” she said. “He’s just genuinely so kindhearted.”
Now, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy — to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family
“The worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,” Mr. Pollard said.
Now, at least for him, it has. — Megan Specia

</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government’s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation

WASHINGTON—The government accuses the company’s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film “Casablanca.” The company likens the government’s case to a shaved Persian cat, “pale and thin.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.
It could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as
Alphabet Inc.’s
Google and
Facebook Inc.
Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.
</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren’t head-to-head competitors. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They want to combine AT&T’s video-distribution network with Time Warner’s content—from HBO’s “Game of Thrones” to the NCAA basketball tournament—in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.
</span>“This will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,” said Wayne State University law professor
Stephen Calkins,
“and what the court says will be terribly important.”

The case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss
Randall Stephenson
and U.S. antitrust chief
Makan Delrahim.
Mr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.
Mr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal—the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,
Amazon.com Inc.,
Hulu and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube. Younger customers increasingly watch video on phones, tablets and laptops.
The upheaval has left the pay-TV industry scrambling. Mr. Stephenson made <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $49 billion</span> play for video distribution by acquiring DirecTV, the top U.S. pay-TV satellite service, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> He’s now trying to make the company’s wireless and video bundles more attractive to viewers and investors by adding Time Warner news, sports and entertainment assets to the package.
Given Mr. Delrahim’s objections, the deal has been pending <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 17 months</span>, creating something of an industry chessboard frozen in time, with competitors uncertain of their next play. Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.’s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with
Walt Disney Co.
instead. (Journal parent company News Corp and
21st Century Fox
share common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as
Comcast
and
Verizon Communications Inc.
and clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.

Question of competition
The case raises this central question: If AT&T buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.
Mr. Delrahim’s team says yes. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and “American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.”
</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren’t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner’s content, especially the Turner networks—including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV—are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner’s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.

On the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn’t be so willing under AT&T. “With the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,” it says in filings.
AT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast’s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of “behavioral” conditions.
AT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone’s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. “AT&T and Time Warner aren’t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,” the companies say.
AT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn’t remedy the merger’s harms to competition.
Where Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T’s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers’ interests and preferences.

</span>Bad blood
High-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.
Mr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim’s motives and cited a television interview <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn’t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.
The two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President
Donald Trump,
as a carrot to win Justice Department approval.
Mr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.
The Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson’s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film “Casablanca,” quoting his famous line, “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”
People close to AT&T’s management say the department’s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable statements.
AT&T, in its own brief, said the department’s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: “Now, what remains of the government’s case, ‘like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,’ ” borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 case</span>.
That choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 19.</span> This isn’t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger’s fate.
The Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.
AT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO
Jeff Bewkes,
about what they see as the deal’s benefits.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor
Carl Shapiro,

There is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump’s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the “elephant in the room” when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.
Mr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn’t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump’s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T’s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn’t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.
Judge Leon’s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.
The AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company—and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $4 billion</span>.
</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department’s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump’s comments about the deal.
The Justice Department has been riding a decade’s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.
Mr. Delrahim’s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

Want more stories about how health-care policy affects you? Read Paige Winfield Cunningham.
Americans are flocking to Healthcare.gov in greater numbers than ever before in a development that runs precisely contrary to the doom-and-gloom everyone had predicted for this enrollment season.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">I think it’s safe to say that last year, the Obama administration would have pretty much killed for the shockingly brisk pace of Obamacare signups in the first four days the federal health insurance website opened for business.
</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced yesterday that more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600,000 people</span> selected plans from Nov.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 through</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.</span> Those figures appear quite a bit higher than last year, when just over a million people selected plans in the first dozen days (the best comparison available at this point). More than one in five of those people —<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 137,322 </span>— were new enrollees.
That’s despite the Trump administration’s much cooler attitude toward Healthcare.gov and Obamacare more generally. It seems certain the administration was trying to undercut enrollment figures by halting TV and radio advertising for the open enrollment season, chopping off navigator fund for groups that help people sign up and doing only the bare minimum to let people know they can start shopping.

In the face of suppressed outreach from Trump...
I should emphasize that it’s still just the very beginning of the six-week signup period -- and way too early to know how this year will turn out in comparison to years past. But the initial trajectory is one that virtually no one predicted.
Let’s explore a few reasons why this might be:<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> More Americans can get more generous subsidies this year.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">This is a phenomenon stemming from Trump’s decision to cut off extra payments to insurers for cost-sharing reductions they must offer.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">We elaborated on this effect in Monday’s The <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202,</span></span> but here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: To make up for losing the payments, many insurers hiked prices for their mid-grade “silver plans.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And because premium subsidies are based on silver plan prices, the subsidies are going up too, making bronze and gold plans even cheaper for many low-income people.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I really believe the availability of these very low-cost plans could be a game changer,” said Josh Peck, who served as Healthcare.gov’s chief marketing officer under Obama and now heads up the group Get America Covered.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Enrollees eligible for subsidies will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $555 on</span> average to offset the cost of their plans, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 45 percent</span> from this year’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $382 average</span> tax credit, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
</span>Point 2: It would be even <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">better 4 ppl</span> of all incomes & geos if Trump hadn't created uncertainty, repressed competition/enrollment, etc. 7/— Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>2</span>. People with a Healthcare.gov account are still getting reminder emails.
I know this because I created an account several years ago. I’ve received at least four reminder emails in the last week, telling me I should visit the website to search for a plan. So have others:
NYT's Margot Sanger-Katz:
https://t.co/FKjaESoJ24 is sending signup reminders, with details on the open enrollment period. I just got this one. pic.twitter.com/gIGSS2R9U5— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>Over</span> the last four years, the Obama administration created a large database of email addresses for past and current enrollees. Even though it appears the Trump administration isn’t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past – like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around – email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span> Maybe brokers are kicking butt.
Before the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they’d helped enroll an <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 40 to</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50 percent</span> of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 43 percent</span> of new enrollments on the state’s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment.
The Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration’s refusal to promote the law.
EHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span>, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage.
“Web-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,” the company’s CEO Scott Flanders told me. “So it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.”<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it.
If the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won’t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that’s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn’t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said.
“Outreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,” Peck said.

AHH: There’s an expensive big fight brewing between two powerful lobbies -- hospitals and drug makers -- around an obscure drug discount program called 340B, Politico's David Pittman reports. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The program is supposed to help rural and charity hospitals by offsetting the cost of medicines for these low-income providers with discounted drugs.</span> But 340B has grown exponentially, now <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprising $16 billion</span> worth of medications dispensed in hospitals every year.
""Drug companies have gone on offense,"" David writes. ""In paid advertising, messaging through an army of lobbyists and on-the-record briefing of reporters, the pharmaceutical industry has crafted a message that hospitals are taking <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $6 billion</span> in drug discounts and using it to enrich themselves rather than help poor patients. They say the 340B cash has even played a role in hospitals buying up doctors’ offices, causing a rise in health care costs that more than cancels out any benefit of the drug discounts.""
“It seems to be a perversion of this program that patients might be paying more today than they would have prior,” Lori Reilly, PhRMA executive vice president, told reporters recently. “The goal of 340B was to lower costs to patients, not increase them.”
""Hospitals deny that characterization,"" David continues. ""But it’s caught the attention of at least some on the Hill. Congressional offices are drafting bills that would more tightly limit how hospitals use the discounts...The lobbying has escalated fast. <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 160 organizations</span>, almost all drug companies, hospitals and community health centers, reported lobbying on 340B last quarter, spending a <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined $41.8 million</span>, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms.""
OOF: A provision in the annual defense authorization bill has sparked a fiery debate over whether the Pentagon should be allowed to authorize the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices for combat soldiers, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
Under existing law, the FDA is the only agency that can authorize the use of medical products -- but the Defense Department can request that the FDA grant approval if there's a threat of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent on the battlefield. The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order “to reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.”
The two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.
OUCH: ""God only knows"" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is “exploiting” human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a “social-validation feedback loop,” Parker said, adding that it is “exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.”
Parker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself ""something of a conscientious objector,"" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. “I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=""7"" class=""red"">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,” Parker said.
</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month. Parker said that when he was helping Facebook get off the ground <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> he and others involved thought: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?”
“And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,"" he said. ""And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you . . . more likes and comments.”
--President Trump, who has blamed China for Americans' increased access to fentanyl, said yesterday he discussed reducing the flow of drugs into the United States with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said that he and the president would be ""focusing on it very strongly,"" without elaborating further.
“Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” Trump said standing alongside Xi, Reuters reported. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,"" the president said.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He added that a ‘special emphasis” would be placed on fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50 to</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 times</span> more addictive than heroin.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later added that Xi ""committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information.""</span> But last week, China’s drug control agency denied Trump’s claim that most fentanyl is produced in China.
-- Meanwhile, the DEA announced yesterday it's taking steps to make it easier to prosecute fentanyl traffickers by temporarily scheduling all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis. That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.
Late last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.
--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare. Starting today, the company will host events to help drivers sign up for marketplace plans in more than two dozen cities from Los Angeles to Indianapolis, Reuters reported.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The company, which employs <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 600,000 U</span>.S. drivers, said <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 150,000 drivers</span> had looked <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2017 insurance</span> plans through its partnership with the consultant group Stride Health.</span> ""This year we’re doubling down on that,” Uber spokeswoman Meghan Joyce told Reuters. The company heavily relies on freelance and contract workers -- a key target population for marketplace enrollments.
--Jimmy Kimmel facetiously celebrated the huge Healthcare.gov enrollment figures for finally allowing him and the president to agree on something.
""I have taken issue with a great many things Donald Trump has done as president but I have to admit, it hasn’t all been bad. In fact, yesterday I was looking at the White House website, healthcare.gov specifically, and I have to admit the health care plan there isn't bad. It's actually pretty good,” Kimmel said on his show Wednesday night.
Kimmel cited The Post’s coverage of record sign ups for what he dubbed ""Trumpcare"" and read out loud messages on social media thanking him for bring “on Trump’s side for once.” Of course, the Trumpcare Kimmel is referring to is still President Obama's Affordable Care Act that Trump keeps promising to repeal.
“If you care about health care, go to Donald Trump’s website, Healthcare.gov,"" Kimmel added.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">--Health and Taxes: The Senate version of a tax bill, which Republicans rolled out yesterday, preserves the popular medical expense deduction that its House counterpart would ditch, the Hill reports.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The deduction allows people with hefty medical costs, who spend more <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> of their gross income on care, to deduct certain qualified expenses like surgery, dentists, eye care, addiction treatment programs or transportation used primarily for or essential to medical care.
</span>""There’s always a sense that it’s a good thing to continue,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The House tax bill has gotten pushback for getting rid of the tax break, which largely benefits low-income families.</span> The Joint Committee on Taxation has said <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 70 percent</span> of the people who claim the deduction make less <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75,000 a</span></span> year.

This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities,"" Doug Stafford said in a statement. ""As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years.""
Stafford added that Paul spoke with his attacker only after his ribs were broken. ""This was not a 'fight,' it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention,"" Stafford said.
Earlier this week, Stafford and Paul both tweeted a link to a Breitbart story that cast a doubt on a report by the New York Times that pointed to landscaping issues as the origin of the altercation:

As Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers
A wide-ranging presidential order helped block a railroad merger and tackle supply-chain problems, and it is planting the seeds for bigger actions.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — As rising inflation threatens his presidency, President Biden is turning to the federal government’s antitrust authorities to try to tame red-hot price increases that his administration believes are partly driven by a lack of corporate competition.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has prodded the Agriculture Department to investigate large meatpackers that control a significant share of poultry and pork markets, accusing them of raising prices, underpaying farmers — and tripling their profit margins during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As gas prices surged, he publicly encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate accusations that large oil companies had artificially inflated prices, behavior that the administration says continued even after global oil prices began to fall in recent weeks.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The push has extended to little-known agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission, which the president has urged to search for price gouging by large shipping companies at the heart of the supply chain.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The turn to antitrust levers stems from Mr. Biden’s belief that rising levels of corporate concentration in the U.S. economy have empowered a few large players in each industry to raise prices higher than a more competitive market would allow.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Corporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.
</span>White House officials concede that their antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately. The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden’s competition agenda.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year’s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.

-</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Psychology of Inflation: Americans are flush with cash and jobs, but they also think the economy is awful.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The administration’s focus on increasing competition “will spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,” said Brian Deese, who heads the White House’s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And, he added, it “will deliver lower prices for Americans right away.”
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The president’s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,” Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">“Did they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden’s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.
</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were “harming competition in the U.S. economy.”
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration’s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation’s ports and to highlight the companies’ promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.
Overall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden’s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.
</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">Inflation F.A.Q.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">What is inflation?</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world’s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">The commission’s analysis determined that market forces — particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out — are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> “I think it has upped our credibility” with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.
Perhaps the administration’s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">“We’re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,” the report said.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">“Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.”
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“The White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,” said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute’s president.
</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and “Big Meat” has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack’s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.
Mr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden’s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.
“These markets have been concentrated for a long time,” said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. “He didn’t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he’s going to fix it now?”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency’s new “Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program” that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.
</span>“The Biden administration understands this and knows this,” said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, “I would like to see more.”",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,
65d3958a8a5c879c9f684b9d,15267,"<h3>Elizabeth Warren: The Federal Reserve Is Trying ‘To Get More People Fired’</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is coming under increasing political pressure to stop raising interest rates as aggressively as it has done so this year.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced another rate hike Wednesday as Democrats worry Powell’s monetary policy will cause a recession.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He’s pushing hard to get more people fired because he thinks that is one way to help bring down inflation,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“But it’s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.
</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Powell has openly admitted that there’s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But the members of the Fed’s board of governors said they think they’ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed’s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year ― still historically high but down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.2% in</span> September.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Powell described the current strength of the labor market as an obstacle to reducing inflation on Wednesday.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Job growth is very high, wages are very high, vacancies are quite elevated and really there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand,” Powell told reporters.</span> “So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Fed can’t do anything about supply problems caused by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, as Powell has repeatedly admitted.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The only thing the Fed can affect through interest rates is aggregate demand in the economy, and it will take an unknown number of months for consumers to feel the impact.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">At a hearing earlier this year, Warren questioned Powell about whether higher interest rates would reduce prices for food or fuel, and he said they would not.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“The chairman of the Fed has admitted to me in a hearing that those rate hikes will not affect the price of groceries, will not bring down the cost of energy, because of the other forces that have driven up prices,” Warren said.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“The moderation in inflation is one more reminder that we need a lot of data about where prices are moving, and we need it over a longer period of time before the Fed hauls off and takes yet again extremist actions to raise interest rates.”</span>",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 5,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET

WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Fears that the El Niño weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.

</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Niño is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Niño will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yields for Australian wheat—which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprise 14% of</span> the world’s exports—could fall as much <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.

El Niño occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Niño event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.

</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">El Niño caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.

</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be. Of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 26 El</span> Niño weather patterns observed <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1900,</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 17 resulted</span> in widespread droughts in Australia, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology.

“Every El Niño is different, including its duration and intensity, as is its impact on agricultural production,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They said the price impact could be deepest for robusta coffee—used in instant coffee—raw sugar and wheat, crops grown in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil that are likely to be affected by El Niño.

</span>Garry Hansen, a farmer who grows wheat as well as raises cattle and sheep on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8,000</span>-hectare farm in Coomandook in southern Australia, is already concerned about the area’s dryness. The region has had little rain over the last two years.

“We don’t have a lot of moisture in the bank and we are a little bit worried about the forecast. We could do with the rain,” said Mr. Hansen, who added June’s rainfall was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20% of</span> its normal level. He said making sure there were no weeds taking water away from the wheat crop was one of the few things he could do to combat El Niño.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“You have to manage the business like it is going to rain but you also have to maximize water efficiency,” said Mr. Hansen.

Wheat exported from Brisbane on Australia’s eastern coast, near to farmland that could be most affected by El Niño, is already trading at a premium of more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% to</span> wheat shipped from Adelaide in South Australia, said Rob Imray, managing director at commodity marketing firm Farmarco Australia.

</span>It may take a few months before El Niño’s impact is felt in other agricultural commodities. Palm-oil harvests will be affected by drier weather, but the extent won’t be visible until six months after El Niño occurs, Singapore-based Golden Agri-Resources, the second-largest producer of the commodity, said in an email.

“As El Niño has just started, it is currently too early to estimate production output <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2016,</span>” the company said. It said palm-oil farmers could apply fertilizer to their land earlier than normal to help counter any worsening of weather conditions.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">El Niño could boost trading firms that act as middlemen between buyers and sellers of food.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such firms tend to profit more when commodity prices are volatile—provided they read weather and market conditions correctly.

</span>“We are watching [the situation] like a hawk and we will see what happens,” Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Singapore-based trader Olam, said earlier this year. He said El Niño could lead to shortages of wheat, corn and sugar in some Southern Hemisphere countries, although higher rainfall could help crops elsewhere.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Market fears about the impact of El Niño have eased due to a good start to the monsoon season in India and Bangladesh, said Aurelia Britsch, senior commodities analyst at BMI Research.</span> The monsoon season has brought more rain than normal despite earlier forecasts that India’s rainfall would be down <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 12%,</span> while the weather in northern parts of Asia has been broadly in line with historical averages.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Any upward pressure on food prices from El Niño could also be offset by ample stocks of several commodities, particularly of rice, palm oil and sugar, some analysts say.

</span>And while dry conditions could weigh on crop yields in Asia, wetter weather caused by El Niño in South America could boost crops of soybeans, corn and sugar there.

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET

U.S. stocks’</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.

Assets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $50.3 billion</span> in September. The ETF has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">advanced 5.1% over</span> the past month.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Value stocks, often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth, saw the largest divergence in performance from their growth-focused counterparts this decade, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study that looked at the first half of September.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors have pared positions in technology stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns in recent years.

</span>Funds tracking momentum stocks, those that investors are purchasing because they have been rising, recorded last week their first significant outflows since March of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And one of the biggest momentum-focused ETFs has edged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.4% over</span> the past month, underperforming the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> which has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 4.2%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves are the latest sign of how a jumble of contradictory data has investors grappling with two divergent paths for the U.S. economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A recovery from a soft patch in growth would, in theory, boost companies such as financials and energy companies, whose shares have underperformed broader markets over the years.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But an economy weakened by protracted trade conflicts and slowing growth abroad would likely push the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy, providing a tailwind for Treasurys and growth stocks.

</span>Many investors are opting for a nuanced approach. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Hugo Rogers, who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $5 billion</span> as chief investment strategist at Deltec International Group, said his fund this month trimmed positions in Treasurys and gold and picked up shares of oil drillers, including Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. Shares of the S&P 500’s energy sector have zipped past the broader index in the past month, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 8.5%.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We are trading what we think are the early stages of a reversal, and watching out for a bigger reversal that can last for many years,” he said.

</span>A confluence of factors is driving the most recent shift. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many are worried that the world’s biggest central banks are unlikely to loosen monetary policy much further.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Rates in Europe and Japan are already at or near historic lows, while the Fed has signaled that its latest rate cuts are unlikely to be followed by a long easing cycle.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That could spell bad news for the big, momentum-driven technology stocks, which have been a key engine for the market’s gains in recent years.</span> Some of the largest tech stocks have lost steam. Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2016.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 shed</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.8%.</span>

</span>Momentum stocks haven’t been as widely held as they are now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.

</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.

</span>Momentum trades “worked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,” Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span>

Still, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.

</span>“It’s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. “It’s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.”

Yet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn’t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2001.</span>

</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. “A lot of people don’t understand that value cannot die,” she said.

Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world
Bank reserves are normally obscure, even to bankers and professional investors.</span> But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs—known as the overnight repo rate—to spike. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a worry, because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> but it shot up almost as high <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% on</span> Tuesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market.</span> That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">To settle markets down, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has dipped into this market, conducting three auctions this week where banks could swap Treasurys (or bonds from institutions like Fannie Mae ) for new reserves.</span> It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $75 billion</span> in repos.
Here’s is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they’ve come to matter.
What are reserves?
Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.
Central bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called “reserves.” The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.
There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.
What are reserves for?
The main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.
But that’s not what really happens. In fact, the first person’s bank reduces the amount in the person’s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person’s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don’t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.
</span>Where do reserves come from?
One way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Whether it wants to pay government workers’ wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government’s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.
Where does QE come in?
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of QE—quantitative easing—was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.
</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.
</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer’s bank account disappears.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.
</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?
This is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn’t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.
Newsletter Sign-up
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">If banks don’t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn’t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn’t yet been identified.

The upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.
The final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.
The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.
In the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC’s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.
Kickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time — 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there’s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl’s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.
Outside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L’Équipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).
After the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year’s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.
Local sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.
Now, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.
“When you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,” Demoff said.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“You get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.”
Temperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.
It’s been <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.
Across the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.
SoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.
Here are where temperature records were broken in 2021:
A common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, has been that this year’s Super Bowl is “just another game.”
“Obviously it’s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,” Burrow said after Friday’s practice, the last of the season.
Their opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year’s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.
But despite the Bengals’ relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
He said that he and Duke Tobin, the team’s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.
“They certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments — they have proven that over the last two months,” Taylor said. “It’s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we’ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.”
Nine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.
When Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.
Miller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.
Blocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals’ offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.
Burrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams’ pass rush if the Bengals can’t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ticket prices for this year’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.
The Bengals play in one of the league’s smallest markets, but their fans haven’t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).
While the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.
All fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.
Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor “mega” events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.
Away from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.
“You’re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,” Sikka said. “You should test to go to your Super Bowl party.”",,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinton attacks the GOP on climate change. But her plan has a glaring gap.
HILLARY CLINTON has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago — and it has a glaring gap.
Ms. Clinton’s proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn’t taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy.</span> On this, Ms. Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.
Ms. Clinton’s strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Obama’s greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Mr. Obama’s promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 26 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 28 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> increase renewables <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> of the power grid <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2030.</span> Ms. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2027,</span> with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.
To get there, Ms. Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions, a concept that resembles Mr. Obama’s Race to the Top education initiative. She would invest in more energy research and development. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She would also use the tax code to subsidize investment in or electricity production from renewable energy sources, extending and reforming the renewables tax subsidies already on the books.
</span>Yet it’s curious that Ms. Clinton didn’t offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them. Others could include nuclear power or careful use of natural gas in the medium term. What matters is not how the country slashes its emissions but that it does so — and as cheaply as possible.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country’s complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions.</span> This wouldn’t tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Market behavior would therefore become much more rational: Businesses and consumers would use electricity more carefully; the market appeal of low-carbon energy technologies would reflect their real value; government planners would have less influence over the country’s energy future.
</span>The drawbacks are all political. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The term “carbon tax” doesn’t play well.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Cap and trade” has been smeared.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet Ms. Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.</span> Giving the policy its due would hardly be the most politically unrealistic campaign proposal a candidate has offered. Yet it would be among the most reasonable.
Clinton grandee John Podesta assures that “these proposals are only the first steps in an ambitious climate and energy strategy.” We hope so.",,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

65d3958a8a5c879c9f684b9d,28210,"<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball’s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 111 losses</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.
Everywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like “leadership,” “trust” and “desire” filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.
It was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise’s first World Series <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span>
But on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport’s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.
The shock waves have been seismic. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets — all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers’ signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.
</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing “to determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.”
For some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers — whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— tweeted on Thursday: “I would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.”
Wood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.
“The word that keeps popping into my mind is ‘unfathomable,’” said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. “Maybe that’s me being naïve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.”
Suspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.
On Oct.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.
Yet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.
In the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros’ acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.
Taubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.
Houston’s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team’s hierarchy and demoted Ryan’s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.
</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team’s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher’s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.
Over the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s investigators <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.
Even before The Athletic’s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers’ subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.
But they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston’s hitters but sensed something shady.
“When you’d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,” Vogt said. “As a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn’t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.”
It was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While power hitters generally strike out frequently — a trade-off for swinging aggressively — the Astros’ lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 1910 through</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> only two teams — <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians — led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">both 2017 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span>
“I don’t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,” said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros’ hitting coach, explaining the team’s philosophy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: “If you go in with that mind-set, you’re not going to miss your pitch as often.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros’ scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have — possibly costing players money and jobs.
</span>“Now you’re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down” to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, “because they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?”
The Astros’ players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.
“It’s time for the players involved to step forward,” the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. “Take your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there’s some integrity still in you somewhere.”
The ‘model organization’ created a firestorm.
The Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros’ owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.
Some in the Astros’ organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Luhnow, who has a master’s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team’s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team’s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“One of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,” he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> “Depth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.”
Luhnow — who did not respond to an interview request for this article — inherited a team with the majors’ worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.
“The players couldn’t understand why the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">best 25 guys</span> weren’t breaking camp with us,” said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014.</span> “We tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we’d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.”
Even before the N.B.A.’s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word “process” as a euphemism for tanking — a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston’s attendance sank <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team’s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball’s analytical and technological revolution.
“To me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,” said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros’ radio play-by-play voice <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2006 through</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012.</span> “They brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.”
The results began revealing themselves <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros’ database had been hacked by the Cardinals’ scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.
Correa eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.
In hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa — who declined an interview request — could not resist commenting. “Guess who isn’t surprised?” he tweeted.
Baseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros’ explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before — as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.
In the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington’s wins came at the Astros’ park in Houston.
Sign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology. M.L.B. officers monitor video replay rooms now — they did not do so <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and the league will most likely reinforce its rules with prominent signage in clubhouses.
But the Astros’ scandal has brought the issue to a crossroads: Should baseball run from technology to crack down on cheating, or lean into it? League officials are considering a ban on players’ looking at live video during games, yet they are also working on prototypes of electronic signs between catchers and pitchers, though nothing is considered close to game-ready.
Those will not be the only efforts to beat back the Astros’ influence. The M.L.B. players’ union hopes to discourage tanking in the next collective bargaining agreement, and the Astros’ model may already be losing its appeal. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most imitators have not seen the same results, and this winter’s robust free-agent market — after two slow off-seasons — seems to indicate that more teams are trying to be competitive.
</span>The Astros should still be a force on the field this season, if their talent can overcome the organizational upheaval, the public skepticism over their achievements and the newfound awkwardness of their place within the players’ fraternity. In any case, the scandal has disgraced the dominant team of this era — and threatens to swallow up the game.
“None of us, if we looked ourselves in the mirror, would have said, ‘Wow, these guys are morally corrupt, these guys are cheaters,’” said one general manager, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss another team. “Let’s not kid ourselves, they were the model organization. But we know more now.”

Moscow insisted that it would not sell oil that is subject to a price limit agreed upon by the Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span>, even if it means cutting production, adding to questions over whether the plan, which goes into effect on Monday, will succeed in slowing Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span> on Friday agreed to cap the price of Russian crude <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $60 a</span> barrel, putting into place a complex, U.S.-backed plan to limit what Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, can charge for its oil exports.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin’s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules.</span> He said that Russia was “working on mechanisms” to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,” he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union’s embargo on Russian crude imports.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production — which would also harm Russia’s economy — questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression.</span> Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan’s architects were “trying to avoid hard decisions.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $70 a</span> barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $30 a</span> barrel to significantly slash Russia’s revenue.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,
Mr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“The logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $60 instead</span> of, for example,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $30,</span> which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $100 billion</span> a year,” Mr. Zelensky said.
</span>“This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia’s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,” he continued. “This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions.”
The United States had led the push for an agreement along the lines of what was ultimately negotiated. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">After the deal was announced, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen praised the plan.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">It helped “achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,” she said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Western sanctions have so far failed to weaken Moscow’s energy exports: Russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sales than <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">E.U. diplomats have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 countries</span> and allies.
</span>OPEC and its allies, including Russia, said on Sunday that they would leave their quotas for oil production unchanged. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The group, known as OPEC Plus, appears to have decided during a teleconference that there was no reason to alter policy amid the many uncertainties in the oil market.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">On Monday, the European Union will begin an embargo on Russian oil, while the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 industrialized</span> nations and their allies are imposing a price cap <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $60 a</span> barrel on Russian crude.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The looming embargo and the price cap were the chief reasons for the producers’ group to hold its fire.</span> What the outcome of these initiatives will be for oil markets is still to be determined, but they could affect millions of barrels a day of Russian oil. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">OPEC may have decided that it was better off keeping its collective head down rather than risk being blamed if, for instance, prices jump in the coming days.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The coming weeks may see an interplay between the growing difficulties that Russia is likely to have in selling its oil and the effects of a slowing global economy.</span> China will be a key factor. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Lockdowns there are reducing demand for imports.</span> But widespread protests against those restrictions have been followed by some easing of the “zero Covid” rules, offering some hope of a gradual easing and a bounce back in consumption of fuel.
At the moment the oil markets are betting that these momentous shifts can be handled smoothly. But they may be wrong.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">The State of the War
- Russian Oil Price Cap: The E.U. agreed on a $60-a-barrel limit for Russian oil, the latest effort by Western allies to try to deprive Moscow of revenue to finance its war in Ukraine.</span> Here’s how it will work.
- A Pivotal Point: Ukraine is on the offensive, but with about one-fifth of its territory still occupied by Russian forces, there is still a long way to go — and the onset of winter will bring new difficulties.
- Ukraine’s Power Grid: As many Ukrainians head into winter without power or water, crews are racing to restore Ukraine’s battered energy infrastructure, but Russian airstrikes threaten to undo such efforts.
Ukrainian soldiers have raised the national flag at a location on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region, according to a video published by a Ukrainian military unit, an apparent sign of Kyiv’s intent to press its counteroffensive in the south.
The video, released on Saturday, did not indicate that Ukraine had established a permanent military presence on the east bank, which is controlled by Russian forces. Nor did it indicate any concerted effort by Ukrainian forces who recently reclaimed Kherson city to push across the river and attack Russian defensive positions.
But analysts said the video, posted on Telegram by a detachment of the Ukrainian military’s “Carlson” air intelligence unit, signaled Ukraine’s desire to show it would continue its southern counteroffensive even as falling temperatures make fighting more challenging, and as Russian forces continue to fire from their eastern positions toward Kherson city.
The video, set to swelling music and apparently filmed with the intention of sending a message, shows soldiers on three speedboats crossing the river, which is hundreds of yards wide, and docking at an abandoned wooden jetty on an island where small civilian boats were moored. Aerial footage shows the Ukrainian flag draped from high on a crane in the wharf, which the video says is in Olezhky, a district opposite Kherson city. The timing and authenticity of the footage could not be independently confirmed.
“This flag was raised by the fighters of the ‘Carlson’ special unit. It will become a bridgehead for the de-occupation of the left bank of the Kherson region,” an unidentified man in military fatigues said. The left bank refers to the river’s eastern bank.
The area on which the troops landed appeared to be empty, which is consistent with previous Ukrainian and other military reports that Russian forces had largely pulled back from the shoreline northeast of the city of Kherson. The location appeared to be a low-lying, swampy area with few roads, which analysts say Russian forces were unlikely to defend — and which was not a logical starting point for a Ukrainian military push.
Still, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said that if confirmed, the “limited Ukrainian incursion onto the east bank could open avenues for Ukrainian forces to begin to operate on the east bank.”
When Ukraine entered Kherson city three weeks ago after Russian forces withdrew — a watershed moment in the nine-month war — its troops secured the whole of the western bank of the river in the region. The next phase of their counteroffensive in the south would likely involve pushing across the river and trying to reclaim land that stretches south to the coast and leads to Crimea, the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
On Saturday, Ukrainian officials issued an urgent call for civilians to leave Russian-occupied areas on the eastern bank because of “the possible intensification of hostilities in this area.”
Several factors, however, have made further progress uncertain for Ukraine. The river presents a formidable barrier, and the main bridge across, the Antonivsky, is destroyed. Analysts also say that Russian forces withdrew largely intact from Kherson and have spent weeks digging defensive barriers on the eastern side of the Dnipro. The onset of winter, too, has made military operations more difficult, both in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are defending territory they have seized in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
“We’re seeing kind of a reduced tempo, already, of the conflict,” Avril D. Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday. She said that the pace of Ukrainian operations would likely pick up in the spring.
Small units of Ukrainian troops have, for weeks, been running sabotage operations on the river’s eastern bank, laying mines and staging ambushes. At the same time, Russia has been lobbing shells across the river at the city of Kherson and at villages to the north.
On Saturday, one person was killed and two others were injured in a barrage of Russian shelling, said the head of Kherson’s regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, on the Telegram social messaging app.
PARIS — An “essential point” in any peace talks on the war in Ukraine should be how to provide security “guarantees to Russia,” given Moscow’s concerns over NATO, President Emmanuel Macron of France has said.
Mr. Macron’s remarks, in a television interview broadcast on Saturday, picked up a theme he has pursued since before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> but has not repeated of late. “We need to prepare what we are ready to do, how we protect our allies and member states, and how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table,” Mr. Macron said.
“One of the essential points we must address — as President Putin has always said — is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,” he said.
The interview with TF1, a French television network, appeared sympathetic to the concerns of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.
Mr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.
During his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.
There was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron’s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.
David Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron’s proposal on Telegram.
He said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was “leave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.”
The last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span> Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine’s “independence and sovereignty in the existing borders” in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.
<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2019,</span> when he declared the need for the reinvention of “an architecture of security” between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new “stability order” in Europe.
Although he has condemned Mr. Putin’s “imperial” invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.
Responding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron’s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: “Devastating.”
Dr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer’s tweet, saying: “You know you’re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin’s state propaganda praises you. It seems that no matter how brutal Putin is, Macron can’t let go of his flawed vision.”
There is deep suspicion of Mr. Macron’s approach to Russia in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and other states in the European Union and NATO that were once under the Soviet totalitarian yoke. This has undermined his aspirations to European leadership.
On Feb.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> shortly before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Putin set out three demands at a joint news conference with Mr. Macron in Moscow. These were: an end to NATO enlargement; no missile deployments near Russia’s borders; and a reduction of NATO’s military infrastructure in Europe to its levels <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> before the Baltic and central European states previously controlled by Moscow joined the alliance.
The United States dismissed the Russian demands as “non-starters” at the time, but Mr. Macron appears to have a more nuanced view.",,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:19 pm ET

An October surge in the U.S. dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets’ vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 10 trading</span> days, hitting a high last seen in the spring.</span> It has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 2.4% this</span> month. China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday, while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, Mexico declined against the dollar.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The dollar’s strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields, reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December, and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose by <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.02 percentage</span> point <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.778%,</span> its highest close since early June, while Nymex crude closed <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $50 for</span> a third consecutive day.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The increases in the dollar and U.S. bond yields so far have been modest, while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 15.54 points</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18144.20.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis, by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging markets.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Clearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed,’’ said Gemma Wright-Casparius, senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard Group.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">A stronger dollar is generally good for the U.S. economy, boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflation.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But a rising dollar also stands to hit U.S. corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It also threatens to hamstring policy makers’ efforts to generate modest inflation gains.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“This Fed is more market dependent than data dependent,’’ said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting, he said, “the Fed is very unlikely to raise rates.”

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates “relatively soon,” according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon, although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate move.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Federal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 70% probability</span> of a rate increase by the Fed’s meeting in December, according to data from CME Group.</span> The odds were <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 50% a</span> month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit vote.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Eurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the U.S. hit a two-year high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.255 trillion</span> for the week ended Oct.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> according to data from TD Securities.

Rising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear decline.

</span>The yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month, while the 10-year U.K. gilt yield <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 1% Wednesday</span>.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Some analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlook.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As a result, some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The so-called 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.65 percentage</span> point late Wednesday, a five-month high, according to Tradeweb.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The figure suggests investors expect annual U.S. inflation <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.65% in</span> the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 10 years</span>.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">To be sure, few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Fed’s favored inflation measure has been below the central bank’s targets for more than four years.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Skeptics point to continuing challenges, such as rising debt and slowing growth in China.

</span>The People’s Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.7258 on</span> Wednesday, marking <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.24% decline</span> in the yuan from Tuesday’s midpoint. Wednesday’s fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2010.</span>

The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken. Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan, and that the People’s Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan moves.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Eric Stein, co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management, said markets “seem far less sensitive” to the yuan’s weakness this time than they were in the market declines of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2015 and</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2016.</span>

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“I don’t think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks,’’ he said.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">”But if financial conditions broadly tighten, that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them” to emphasize they don’t expect long-term rates to rise sharply.

Declines in major U.S. benchmarks follow disappointing sales from major tech firms
A tumultuous week for markets around the world ended with a rocky Friday session, putting the S&<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 on</span> the cusp of correction territory as investors continued an October retreat from risky assets.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">As stocks tumbled in early trading, the benchmark stock index fell <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3% to</span> breach the level that would place <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">it 10% below</span> last month’s record.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But as was the case for much of a whirlwind week marked by intraday dips and sharp rebounds, stocks stabilized—before slipping again in the final hour of trading.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Worries about corporate revenue peaking and a slowdown in China and Europe potentially spilling over into the U.S. economy have sent stocks into a tailspin.</span> Fast-growing internet firms have been some of the hardest hit during the turmoil, leading analysts to question whether companies that previously seemed immune to global growth fears can continue surging ahead.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Quarterly sales from Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet disappointed investors, sending the two stocks sharply lower Friday and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its worst week since March.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Once you start seeing a slowdown in revenue, it makes sense that those stocks could fall, but what’s been upsetting is you see everything coming down,” said Craig Hodges, portfolio manager for Hodges Funds.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I’m really amazed at some of the prices I see.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Hodges said he has been buying shares of materials stocks and home builders that have been engulfed by this week’s selling and are among the market’s worst performers this year.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">With Amazon’s drop, the e-commerce company’s market value fell to <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $800 billion</span>, putting it behind Microsoft as the second-largest U.S. company after Apple.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">After Amazon hit <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1 trillion</span> market cap in early September, some analysts had anticipated it would soon overtake Apple as the world’s largest publicly traded company.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But investors have said weaker-than-expected revenue has stoked fears about softening global demand.

</span>“We’ve had a couple of days of pullbacks, and now we’re getting calls asking, ‘Is this the time to go to cash?’” she said. “We’re trying to walk them through why they need to sit tight.”
Some analysts said they are waiting until after next month’s midterm elections, typically a boon for stocks, to decide how to react to the recent volatility. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Many companies will resume sizable stock buybacks following corporate earnings reports, and trade discussions between the U.S. and China are continuing.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">But other investors’ anxieties have already reached a fever pitch, as the swiftness of this week’s pullback has rekindled fears of <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis and the dot-com bubble <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span>

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 30,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 1</span>:37 pm ET

Mortgage rates dropped <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 4% for</span> the first time since early last year, adding to hopes for a revival in the housing market.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The average rate this week on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.99%,</span> mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Thursday.</span> That marks a fall of nearly a full percentage point from the highs of November. Some lenders have been offering rates well below that.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Lower rates stand to make mortgages more affordable for buyers, and the sharp fall so far <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 has</span> lifted optimism for a market that has cooled after years of torrid home price growth around the country.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Lower rates should “give a boost to the housing market, which has been on the upswing,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, citing home-sales data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The drop in mortgage rates tracks a decline in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which was recently at its lowest <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Yields have fallen amid concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for a protracted trade dispute with China.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economy has remained relatively strong during the first three months of the year.</span> It grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1%,</span> according to data released Thursday. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Still, concerns about an economic slowdown could weigh on the housing market, particularly after a mini boom earlier in the year.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Unlike earlier this year, there is no backlog of buyers waiting to enter the market, and a slowing economy is preventing homebuying sentiment from rising from 10-year lows,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Housing data have been mixed.</span> The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that the number of previously owned houses going into contract <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.5% from</span> the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the measure has been down <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 consecutive</span> months. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">But purchase applications have been trending higher, and new-home sales have mostly been climbing this year.

Millions of workers are doing their day jobs from makeshift set-ups in their living rooms and kitchens, while those in England who can't work from home are now encouraged to go back in if they can do so safely.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">But how exposed to coronavirus might you be in your job?</span> And how does that compare to others?
Data from the UK's Office for National Statistics, based on a US survey, puts into context the risk of exposure to disease, as well as the amount of close human contact workers had before social distancing and other safety measures were introduced.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">See how your job ranks by using the search below.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">While most jobs require people to work relatively closely to others - somewhere in the range between arm's length and a shared office environment - there are very few that typically involve exposure to disease more than once a year.
</span>It's important to note that the data on both exposure to disease at work and how close people are to others is based on interviews that took place with US workers before the pandemic broke out and social distancing recommendations were introduced.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some jobs may find it easier to adjust than others and there may be slightly different working practices and conditions in the US for certain occupations.</span> The results can be expected to be broadly the same in most developed countries.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Almost all the jobs that have a high exposure to both disease and other people are healthcare professions, while those who scored low on both measures include artists, lawyers and those in more typical office jobs like marketing, HR and financial advisers.
</span>Cleaners, prison officers and undertakers are among those who have relatively high exposure to disease without so much close interaction with other people.
But the people who might be most at risk to a new infectious disease like Covid-19, are those who have lots of close contact with people, but aren't used to being exposed to disease.
Bar staff, hairdressers and actors fall into this category, as well as taxi drivers and bricklayers.

Other figures released by the ONS this week showed that deaths in the healthcare sector in the UK are no higher on average than those in the wider community, although social care workers were dying at higher rates. Given that these healthcare occupations are so exposed to both disease and other people, why have there not been more deaths?
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">This could be because workers in these jobs are more likely to be using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves, says Ben Humberstone, deputy director for health analysis at the ONS.</span> They also follow regular hygiene measures like washing hands.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">One of the jobs which had many more coronavirus deaths than the average was taxi drivers.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That's a job which scores highly in terms of closeness to other people, particularly among those jobs which are still actually possible to do at the moment.</span> Bar staff, hairdressers and fitness instructors all score higher, but with bars, gyms and hair salons shut, most of these people will be isolating.
As taxi drivers are less exposed to disease in normal times, there may not be an existing culture of regular hand-washing and wearing PPE. Some firms are trialling partition screens and distributing gloves and masks to protect their drivers and customers.
Methodology
The data in the look-up comes from this release by the ONS.
The figures on proximity to others and exposure to disease come from a survey carried out by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) in which they asked respondents in the US to place themselves on a 1-5 scale for the following two questions.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job?
</span>2. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">How often does your current job require you to be exposed to diseases or infection?
</span>For exposure to disease, a score of one means they are never exposed, while a score of five means they are exposed daily. It's referring to any disease, not coronavirus specifically.
For the physical closeness question, one means the respondent works more than 100ft away from the nearest other person, while five means they need to touch or be near to touching other people at work. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The survey was carried out before social distancing measures were introduced and workers in certain jobs will of course find it easier to adjust than others.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The responses for people in the same jobs were averaged together and extrapolated to form a score <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">We've looked at these scores out of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100 and</span> given each job a ranking.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">If any two jobs had the same score we've given them a tied ranking.

65d3958a8a5c879c9f684b9d,77623,"<h3>Four nursing home residents have died at an evacuation facility, Louisiana officials say.</h3>Extreme Weather and Climate UpdatesSept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> 8:13 p.m. ET
Four Louisiana nursing home residents who were evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ida have died at facility where state inspectors were prevented from conducting a full assessment this week, state officials said on Thursday.
Three of the fatalities have been classified as storm-related by the coroner, though definitive causes of death have not yet been confirmed, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
The deaths occurred at a facility in Tangipahoa Parish, north of New Orleans. Inspectors “promptly visited the site but were expelled from the property,” state officials said in a written statement. “We have significant concerns about conditions in this facility.”
More <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800 residents</span> from seven different nursing homes had been moved to the Tangipahoa Parish facility, and state officials said they are working to find safe placements for them, beginning with the most vulnerable.
As of Thursday morning,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 721 had</span> been moved. A dozen of those required hospitalization.
“We will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement,” the State Department of Health said.
“It’s very disheartening,” said Robby Miller, the Tangipahoa Parish president.
Mr. Miller called the incident is a cautionary tale for others with family members in nursing homes in Louisiana: The conditions and quality of care at an evacuation facility may not be as good as in a typical nursing home.
Some of the nursing home residents have now been moved to a state facility run by Louisiana State University in Alexandria, Mr. Miller said.
The news came as officials in New Orleans announced on Thursday that they were organizing a voluntary evacuation option for residents hoping to get out of the city, which remains largely without electricity.
Details of that plan are still in the works, but it would allow residents to be taken to a state-run shelter outside the city, said Collin Arnold, the New Orleans director of homeland security.
The city would give priority to elderly and disabled residents and then make the option available to the general public, he said.
Across Louisiana, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 594,000 customers</span> remained without power on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the electric utility Entergy. By early afternoon,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,000 power</span> customers in New Orleans had their electricity restored, said Ramsey Green, the city’s deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Entergy hoped to restore full power to the French Quarter and central business district by late Thursday, he said.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 27 electric</span> substations in New Orleans, Mr. Green said,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 are</span> back online.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell, speaking at an afternoon briefing, noted that in addition to electricity, access to fuel continues to be a challenge for city residents. “We just have not received adequate fueling sources to the general public.” Ms. Cantrell promised that “when we get more we shall share more.”
The storm that ripped through southeastern Louisiana on Sunday left a still-untold number of people without homes and wreaked havoc on other essential services. Hundreds of thousands of people found themselves in places where water infrastructure was badly damaged by the storm and pumps and treatment plants were left without power.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, who is expected to visit the state on Friday, said the flash floods that inundated New York City and the powerful winds that knocked out power in Louisiana were a sign that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here” and that the storms and fires creating life-or-death situations across the country constituted “one of the great challenges of our time.”
“Hurricane Ida didn’t care if you were a Democrat or Republican, rural or urban,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, urging Congress to pass his economic agenda when it returned from its recess later this month, in order to provide critical investments in electrical infrastructure.</span> “This destruction is everywhere. And it’s a matter of life and death, and we’re all in this together.”
In the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.
In Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.
“This has become basic-level subsistence,” said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.
This was life, upended, in much of the region — an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.
At a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was “a broken community” that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.
“I had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,” she said. “It looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.”
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — There were several flare-ups during a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.
It was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.
“I feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what’s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,” said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.
She added, “I’m just worried sick.”
On Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.
Conditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.
“This is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it’s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire’s edge now,” he said.
Other firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.
Firefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.
After the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.
“The weather has been working in our favor,” said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. “Look at the Dixie fire.”
Firefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake’s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.
The blaze, which <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and “squirrelly winds” in the Kirkwood area.
But so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.

The Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.
More <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews — sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain — build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.
“It becomes ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing — Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.
By Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.
Southeast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties — the town of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.
“The fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,” said David Hammond,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.
Mr. Hammond’s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, “in case we’ve got to go.”
In other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire’s wrath in challenging terrain.
More <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.
Several towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.
“We would hope that we’re on the downhill slide,” Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. “But after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,” he added, “it’s just hard to venture a guess.”
PHILADELPHIA — As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87,</span> was in his <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.
By late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back. Still, it could be worse.
“I feel so bad for the people who lost property,” he said.
Those people were all over the region on Thursday, as residents of Mid-Atlantic States awoke to a trail of destruction left behind by remnants of Ida, which struck Louisiana as a hurricane days before. Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns — and were still rising.
Officials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.
Tens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.
“Al Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,” said Frank Feingold,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.
The Schuylkill had reached the “major” flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.
“We are still doing water rescues across the city; we’ve done that for the <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 15 hours</span> now continually,” Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. “We know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 100 years</span>,” he added. “And potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.”
The mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. “Extreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,” he said. “They are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.”
In Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L’angolo. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.
“It was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,” he said. “It came halfway up the windows.”
Some of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that “the size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,” with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.
“After last night’s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,” said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “Both waterways have already surpassed all-time records.”
In Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.
The Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">got 10 inches</span> of rain. “I don’t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,” Mr. DiGirolamo said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.
One of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.
</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.
“For me it was just like a flash,” said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. “We tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.”
When he came outside, he found his neighbor’s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink. It wasn’t his.

In the aftermath of a ferocious storm caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida that killed more than three dozen people in four states, national and local leaders acknowledged Thursday that extreme weather events posed an urgent and ongoing threat.
The storm killed at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 people</span> in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut and left more <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150,000 homes</span> without power. States of emergency remained in effect across the region by midday Thursday, as officials sought to get a handle on the damage.
Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm
More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 people</span> were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred.
Speaking from the White House, President Biden said the damage indicated that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” constituting what he called “one of the great challenges of our time.”
At a news conference in Queens on Thursday morning, Gov. Kathy C. Hochul of New York said she had received a call from Mr. Biden, who she said “offered any assistance” as the state assessed the damage from Ida, a storm that she said represented a new normal.
“We need to foresee these in advance, and be prepared,” she said.
The deluge of rain on Wednesday — more than half a foot fell in just a few hours — turned streets and subway platforms into rivers. Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 150 miles</span> per hour. Some rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were still rising.
Ida’s remnants brought historic hourly rainfall to New York and New Jersey.
Each bar represents one recorded hour of precipitation in Newark.
The rain broke records set <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 days</span> before by Tropical Storm Henri, underscoring warnings from climate scientists of a new normal on a warmed planet: Hotter air holds more water and allows storms to gather strength more quickly and grow ever larger.
Many of New York City’s subway lines remained suspended into the evening on Thursday. Airports were open but hundreds of flights had been canceled.
In New York City, the dead ranged in age from a 2-year-old boy to an 86-year-old woman, the police said. Some drowned in basement apartments in Queens, where a system of makeshift and mostly illegally converted living spaces has sprung up.
On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that at <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 23 people</span> in the state had died. They included four people found dead in an apartment complex in Elizabeth and two people were killed in Hillsborough, N.J. after they became trapped in their vehicles, a spokeswoman for the town said. Another death occurred in Passaic, N.J., where the Passaic River breached its banks and fish flopped in the streets.
Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced that the state would lower flags to half-staff to honor Brian Mohl, a state police sergeant whose car was swept away by the floodwaters.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 3.15 inches</span> of rain that fell in Central Park in one hour on Wednesday eclipsed the record-breaking one-hour rainfall <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.94 inches</span> on Aug.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span> The National Weather Service, struggling to depict the level of danger, declared a flash flood emergency in New York City for the first time.
In Bergen County, New Jersey’s most populous county, County Executive James Tedesco, a former firefighter, said on Thursday: “We have not complete devastation but close to it. This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.”

Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue, feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by Hurricane Ida and its aftermath. Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.
Before you give, do your research.
Natural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.
</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.
Donations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.
If you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.
Here are some local organizations in the storm area.
All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.
The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.
Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.
AirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.
SBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.
A number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana’s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.
Bayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.
Louisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.
National organizations are lending a hand.
AmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.
Mercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida’s wake and is accepting donations.
GoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.
Project HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.
The Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 90999.</span>
The Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.

Republicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene. A top House Democrat announced the chamber will vote Thursday to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments.
The House will vote on stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee roles as G.O.P. weighs her future.
The House will vote Thursday on whether to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, a top Democrat announced, forcing congressional Republicans to take a public stand on the Georgia freshman who endorsed conspiracy theories and calls to execute Democratic politicians before she was elected.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 Democrat</span>, said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, and that “it is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Representative Greene from her committee assignments.”
House Democrats, incensed by a series of social media posts made by Ms. Greene before she won her seat in November, threatened earlier this week that they would take the unusual step of moving unilaterally to remove Ms. Greene from the education and budget committees if Republicans themselves did not take action.</span> Party leaders generally have authority over who represents them on committees.
The vote will make Republicans go on the record for the first time on whether Ms. Greene should be rebuked for her past comments.
While most Republican lawmakers have privately been horrified by her rhetoric, some have argued that members of Congress should not face punishment for remarks they made before they were elected, and that allowing one party (in this case, Democrats) to take unilateral action against a lawmaker in another party would set a dangerous precedent. Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene’s side.
Mr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference’s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.
A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer’s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would “address this with members later today.”
Mr. Hoyer’s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber. They are also expected to discuss the turmoil around Ms. Greene.
Supporters of Mr. Trump want to strip Ms. Cheney of her leadership post as payback for her vote to impeach the former president. And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.
Ms. Greene’s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.
Ms. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to “rush an emergency donation” to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $160,000 in</span> one day.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Biden says he won’t drop his ‘promise’ <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1,400 stimulus</span> checks, but is open to further targeting them.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">President Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he would not agree to scale back <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,400 direct</span> payments to many Americans that are a centerpiece of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $1.9 trillion</span> stimulus package, but would consider restricting them to lower-income individuals as Republicans have proposed.
</span>“We can’t walk away from an <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $1,400 in</span> direct checks, because people need it,” Mr. Biden told the lawmakers on a private conference call, according to two people who participated. “I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to people.”
But he added: “We can better target the number — I’m OK with that.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden’s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president’s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.
</span>“We need to act fast,” Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. “It’s about who the hell we are as a country.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some Republicans have argued that the next round of stimulus checks should go to Americans most in need.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Biden’s plan, the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">full $1,400 payment</span> would be limited to individuals earning no more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75,000 a</span> year, but those with higher incomes would receive smaller checks.
</span>The president’s signal that he was open to compromise on the matter came a couple of days after he met at the White House <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 10 Republican</span> senators who are seeking <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $618 billion</span> package they said could win bipartisan backing. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their proposal calls for checks of up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,000 that</span> would go only to individuals earning less <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $50,000 a</span> year, with the full payment limited to those whose annual income <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $40,000 or</span> below.
</span>Later, Mr. Biden met separately at the White House with Senate Democrats and again discussed narrowing eligibility for the checks.
“We did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they’re targeted,” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">On the call with House Democrats, Mr. Biden said he was “not married to a particular, absolute number” on the overall stimulus package.
</span>“We can make compromises on several of the programs,” he told them, adding, “we have to take care of the people who are hurting.”
As for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call that that was “not in the cards.”

Senate Democrats will assume chairmanships of committees under a power-sharing deal with Republicans.
Senate Democrats will take control of the chamber’s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.
The lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden’s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.
“I’m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,” Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Senate’s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell’s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.
</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided. It will allow equal party representation on committees but in the cases of tie votes, legislation or nominees will still advance to the floor for consideration.
Though the Senate is split 50-50, Democrats are in control by virtue of the power of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. The formal organizing resolution is expected to be considered later Wednesday.
Brian Sicknick, the officer who died from the Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span>, is honored in a ceremony at the Capitol he helped protect.
In the same room that rioters stormed last month, lawmakers gathered in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday for a memorial service to honor Brian D. Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the Jan.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 attack</span>.
Mr. Sicknick is the fifth person to lie in honor in the Capitol, a distinction reserved for private citizens, while government officials, like former presidents, lie in state.
“Blessed are the peacekeepers like Brian,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said during the ceremony. “Let us be the peacekeepers now in his memory.”
Mr. Sicknick’s family, lawmakers and other top officials attended the ceremony, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who also spoke; the Republican leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California; Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington. Before the service, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also paid their respects.
Mr. Sicknick’s remains were delivered to the Capitol on Tuesday evening, passing through a set of doors still shattered from the events of Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Officers from his unit, some on mountain bikes, lined up near the steps outside.
Minutes later, President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, departed the White House to pay their respects.
“We must be vigilant, as what President Lincoln referred to as the harsh artillery of time, we will never forget,” Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday during the ceremony near a table where Mr. Sicknick’s remains and an American flag were placed. “Each day when members enter the Capitol, this temple of democracy, we will remember his sacrifice and then others that day who fought so hard to protect the Capitol and the Congress.”
Walking out of the rotunda after the service, Representatives Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, and Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, paid their final respects side by side.
At <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 14 other</span> Capitol Police officers were injured in the attack, according to a memo issued by the F.B.I. Two police officers who responded to the siege have since died by suicide.
“Knowing our personal tragedy and loss is shared by our nation brings hope for healing,” Mr. Sicknick’s partner, Sandra Garza, and his family said in a statement.
As he left the Capitol for the final time, Mr. Sicknick was met by rows of officers, saluting the hearse that drove his remains to Arlington National Cemetery.

The Justice Dept. drops a lawsuit accusing Yale of discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants.
The Justice Department on Wednesday withdrew a lawsuit against Yale that charged the university with discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants for admission, another reversal by the new administration of a Trump-era policy.
The Trump administration had made race-based college admissions a target, and today’s action suggests the Biden administration may be prepared to retreat from that policy.
Supporters of the Trump administration’s lawsuit assert that Asian-Americans and whites are being held to higher admissions standards at a number of elite colleges. <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> a federal judge rejected claims that Harvard had intentionally discriminated against Asian-American applicants, but the plaintiffs are expected to file a petition to the Supreme Court.
“Yale is gratified that the U.S. Justice Department has dropped its lawsuit challenging Yale College’s admissions practices,” Karen N. Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Our admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.”
The “notice of voluntary dismissal” of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department’s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.
In a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit “in light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,” including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard’s admissions practices.
But the department said that it would continue an “underlying investigation” to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.
The Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.
“It is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,” said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. “Using race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.”
The lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The government said that race was the “determinative factor” in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that “for the great majority of applicants,” Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.
Violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.
Yale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration’s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.
Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.
She and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump’s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
If Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for “incitement of insurrection.”
At home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It’s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere — beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.
At least one conservative state lawmaker — who described the impeachment vote as “an ice pick in the back” by Republicans who supported it — has printed “Impeach Liz Cheney!” yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.
People close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country’s electoral system.
As she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called “the big lie,” Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump’s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.
Her allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.
“The beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,” said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. “So the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it’s only helping Democrats.”
Some Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden’s immigration policies.
After a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden’s order to pause deportations <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president’s new tone.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.
“This is not what the Biden administration stands for,” Henry Hollithron, the man’s lawyer, said in an interview. “That is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.”
President Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a “deep state” inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws.
Mr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.
Videos celebrating Mr. Trump’s “big, beautiful” border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump’s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol’s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents — whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump — has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration’s reversals of his policies.
Those agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump’s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The day before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE’s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.
</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden’s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.

WASHINGTON — More <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators — in some cases their own bosses — to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent “attack on our workplace” that threatened the peaceful transition of power.
In a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who “smashed” their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his “baseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">“As congressional employees, we don’t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,” they wrote.</span> “And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.”
A copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate’s impeachment trial.
The letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump’s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the “incitement of insurrection” he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials’ behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views — much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.
The House <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.
The House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.
The provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.
“Given the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,” Ms. Pelosi said. “It is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span>”
The vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.
During a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.
“These words and actions raise serious safety concerns,” Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors “a basic safety measure.”
Ms. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines “unconstitutional.”

65d572b0bd09b873303e5916,83514,"<h3>Stand With Us!</h3>Plan draws on research suggesting very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive; tobacco companies say science isn’t conclusive

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 6</span>:59 pm ET

The Biden administration is moving forward on a plan to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a policy that would upend <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $95 billion</span> U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions of people to quit smoking.

The plan, unveiled Tuesday as part of the administration’s agenda of regulatory actions, likely wouldn’t take effect for several years. The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2023,</span> though the agency cautioned that date could change. Then the agency would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue, which could further delay the policy’s implementation.

“Nicotine is powerfully addictive,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement Tuesday. “Lowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit.”

The move would be the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998,</span> when tobacco companies agreed to pay more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 billion</span> to help states pay for healthcare. As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to various marketing restrictions, including a ban on free product samples and advertising on billboards.

The cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 when</span> the pandemic hit. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 12.5% of</span> adults in the U.S., <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 30.8 million</span> people, were cigarette smokers <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. cigarette sales are expected to drop this year to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $95 billion</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $99 billion</span> last year, according to Euromonitor International.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The policy would apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S. Imports of traditional cigarettes would be barred but multinational tobacco companies could continue to sell full-nicotine cigarettes in other countries.</span> New Zealand’s Ministry of Health also has proposed a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes to very low levels as part of a broader plan to curb smoking.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The FDA’s planned rule could sharply decrease U.S. cigarette sales, and tobacco companies intend to fight it.</span> The largest U.S. cigarette makers—Altria Group Inc. <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MO 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle and Reynolds American Inc.—sell alternative products such as nicotine pouches, but revenue for both companies comes predominantly from cigarettes.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Altria shares at market close Tuesday had fallen <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 7% since</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10,</span> when The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration planned to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes.

</span>Reynolds and Altria said Tuesday that encouraging smokers to switch to less harmful options was a better approach to improving public health than reducing nicotine in cigarettes.

“We do actually support the overarching goal here, which is to transition smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free products,” said Murray Garnick, Altria’s general counsel. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We just think that the better way is to create a robust market of FDA-authorized smoke-free products.”

Mr. Garnick said that the policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels wasn’t achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year.</span> If the policy were effective, he said, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.

Nicotine is the addictive chemical that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn’t cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.

The FDA’s nicotine-reduction plan is based on more than a decade of government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Smokers of these cigarettes were more likely to quit or seek their nicotine fix from less-harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes or gum compared with smokers who continued using regular cigarettes.

Cigarette smoking is the most dangerous way to consume nicotine, according to public health officials. While very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive, researchers say, their smoke still contains most of the same carcinogenic compounds as regular cigarette smoke.

According to an FDA study published <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> such a rule would prompt an <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 13 million</span> adult smokers to quit within five years of implementation.

Smoking is linked to more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 480,000 deaths</span> in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And tobacco use costs <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $300 billion</span> a year in direct healthcare and lost productivity, the FDA says.

</span>Cigarette industry executives say the science on low-nicotine cigarettes isn’t conclusive. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">They say that such a rule would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and could lead to consumer confusion around the health risks of very low-nicotine cigarettes.</span> There is widespread misunderstanding in the U.S. about the health risks of nicotine. An FDA study <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 found</span> that <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75% of</span> people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine caused cancer.

Big cigarette companies also say it would take years for them to develop a very low-nicotine cigarette and that it wouldn’t be feasible to manufacture at scale. In the past, tobacco companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. In anticipation of a federal nicotine-reduction rule, Altria and Reynolds have experimented with other ways, including tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.

22nd Century Group Inc., <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">XXII 3.33</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical tobacco plant for a cigarette brand called VLN. The product is currently available for sale in Chicago. Through a federal contract, 22nd Century has also supplied more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 million</span> cigarettes at varying nicotine levels for scientific research.

22nd Century is willing to partner with other cigarette companies to provide tobacco seeds, Chief Executive James Mish said. “It’s immediately scalable,” he said.

Lowering nicotine in cigarettes has been a subject of discussion inside the FDA since the 1990s. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the agency the authority to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes, but only if the policy was based on scientific evidence, a caveat that slowed the process for years. The law stipulated that the FDA couldn’t eliminate nicotine in cigarettes entirely.

Scott Gottlieb, who served as an FDA commissioner during the Trump administration, pursued a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes as part of a broader tobacco policy he proposed <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> But after he left the agency <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> Trump administration officials shelved the plan.

The Biden administration decided to embrace the policy as part of President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative, which aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 50% over</span> the <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 25 years</span>. His administration is also pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which account for more than a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The FDA published a proposed rule on menthols in April and is now soliciting public comments. That ban also likely wouldn’t take effect for several years.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Separately, the FDA is conducting a review of all e-cigarettes on the market and weighing whether their potential benefit as a less-harmful alternative for adult cigarette smokers outweighs the products’ risk to young people.

Health officials are learning more about the deadly pathogen behind the continuing pandemic
Scientists and public-health officials are learning more about the new coronavirus behind a continuing pandemic. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.
What are the symptoms of Covid-19?
The virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.

</span>- What we know about the coronavirus
Some people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don’t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:
• Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath
• Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
• Bluish lips or face
What should I do if I develop symptoms?
If you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.
Isolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.
How worried should I be?
Most people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But “mild” can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you’ll have to be isolated or quarantined.
By not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.
<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.
Public-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn’t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren’t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.
I’m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?
The new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.
Is taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?
Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn’t a cure and won’t prevent you from infecting others.
I’ve heard I shouldn’t take ibuprofen. Is that true?
There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn’t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn’t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.
Is there a test?
Yes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.
Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.
What if I have to self-isolate?
If you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.’s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don’t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.
Don’t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.
Are there drugs to treat coronaviruses?
There aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.’s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.
Two clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.
How do I keep from getting Covid-19?
Schools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending—and in some cases, requiring—that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.
Who is most at risk?
Adults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8% in</span> people <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 70 to</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 79,</span> compared with <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.
Are my children at risk?
Few children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 and</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.
How at risk is someone in the U.S.?
Covid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.
The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.
Public-health officials hope to “flatten the curve” of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That’s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.

How is the virus spread among humans?
It transmits through “respiratory droplets” when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, according to the WHO. The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person’s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.
Respiratory droplets are heavy and don’t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.
Scientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.
How long can the virus survive on surfaces?
It can last up <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.
The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.
Wipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.
Can face masks protect you?
Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings—even a bandanna or scarf will do—in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.
Cloth masks or coverings don’t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren’t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn’t be used on children <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.
What else can I do to protect myself?
The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth—viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.
Is it safe to travel internationally?
The State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.
Can I donate blood?
The CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. “Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,” said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.
To minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.
Going back to basics: What is a coronavirus?
This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.
Seven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
This new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)
How deadly is it?
The overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span> <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won’t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.
The mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.
The overall mortality rate may be less <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.
That is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.1%.</span>
Covid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen—SARS, which erupted in China <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.
But this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.

How easily does the virus spread?
Disease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.5 and</span><span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 to</span><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 other</span> people.
Public-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
Experts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.
What is the incubation period?
People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 11.5 days</span>.
Can you get infected after you have already had the disease?
That isn’t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.
Can you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?
Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance—6 feet or more—from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.
Where did the new coronavirus come from?
The new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">""We have got to get inflation behind us,"" he said.</span> ""I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""
Banks in nearly every country - with the big exceptions of Japan and China - are facing similar trade-offs as they raise rates to combat their own inflation problems.
</span>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce its seventh consecutive rate rise at its meeting on Thursday, while Indonesia and the Philippines are among the other countries also poised for increases.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Analysts are starting to worry that the global sweep of the rate hikes, which ripple out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, loans and credit card debt, could lead to greater economic slowdown than policymakers expect.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Even if it avoids the two quarters of contraction that typically define a recession, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2023 world</span> economy is expected to be at its weakest in more than a decade, excepting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 pandemic</span> year, said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">""What has become clear is that if given the choice between allowing inflation to remain high for a sustained period .... or pushing the economy into a recession, [central bank leaders] would rather push the economy into recession and get inflation back towards target,"" he said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">How much will interest rates go up?
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the US, the Fed is raising rates at one of the fastest paces in its modern history, a sharp reversal after years of low borrowing costs, responding to inflation that is running at a 40-year high.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed initially hoped that the problems would fade as supply chain issues tied to the coronavirus pandemic abated.</span> But the war in Ukraine, which disrupted oil and good supplies, added to the problem.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while oil prices have since come down, inflation pressures are now bubbling across the economy, with the most recent data showing inflation <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3% in</span> August, with big increases in housing, health care and education costs.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Wages, while rising, have not kept pace, hurting household budgets.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Wednesday's rate increase - the fifth in a row - lifts the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow from near zero at the start of the year <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% for</span> the first time since <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect it to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 4.4% by</span> the end of the year - and rise further <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023,</span> sharply higher than its prior forecasts.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">""What is striking is the speed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.</span> ""They're having to move very quickly ... and it means it's more likely to be a surprise to firms and households.<span id=""16"" class=""red"">""
Uncertainty weighs heavily
New Yorker Sean V said he felt lucky that he bought a two-bedroom condo last year, before borrowing costs started their climb, locking in a mortgage rate <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2.6%.</span>
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">But the 30-year-old works in the home loan industry, which has seen business plunge as mortgage rates <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cross 6% for</span> the first time <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">He said he feared losing his job ""every single day"" and was cutting back spending and scrapping holiday plans amid the uncertainty.
</span>""I don't know <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what 2023 is</span> going to bring,"" he said. ""All of that weighs heavily - not just on me, on everybody.<span id=""19"" class=""red"">""
""I don't know how stalling the economy is helping anyone.</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">""
How do higher interest rates reduce inflation?
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Some inflation is seen as healthy, but sudden, sharp price spikes make it hard for households and businesses to plan and reduce spending power, hurting economic growth and eroding living standards over time.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">By raising borrowing costs for businesses and households, central banks intend to reduce demand for big-ticket items like cars, homes or business expansions, which should ease the pressures pushing up prices.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But it also means less economic activity, which typically leads to job losses and other economic pain.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">In the US, where the economy contracted in the first half of the year, home sales have slumped and growing numbers of firms have instituted job cuts or hiring freezes, warning of rising costs and slowdown ahead.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">For now, the US jobs market has shown few signs of slowdown, helping to keep consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - resilient.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But pressure has been rising on the Fed.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, prominent progressive senator, Elizabeth Warren, called the Fed's moves ""extreme"".
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I've been warning that Chair Powell's Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work - and I fear he's already on the path to doing so,"" she wrote on Twitter.
</span>Will rate rises lead to a recession?
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed show policymakers expect growth in the US to slow to a crawl this year, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.2%.</span></span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">They see growth picking up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.2% next</span> year, but predict the unemployment rate will rise <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.4%.</span>
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The forecasts do not show inflation returning to the bank'<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2025.</span>
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr Powell said doing less could lead to even more economic damage.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">""Higher interest rates, slower growth and a softening labour market are all painful for the public that we serve but they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and and do it down the road again,"" he said.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Many analysts are forecasting a recession in the US next year but remain hopeful it will be relatively mild, noting that household finances are in better shape than in prior downturns.
</span>But the war in Ukraine and concerns about energy supplies raise the risks, JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon warned lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.
""There's a chance - not a big chance - a small chance, of a soft landing, there is a chance of a mild recession, a chance of a harder recession. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">And because of the war in Ukraine... and the uncertainty that causes in the global energy supply and food supply, there's a chance could be worse,"" he said.</span> ""I think policymakers should be prepared for the worst.""",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Stresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn’t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“That time is now upon us,” Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell didn’t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Reserves dropped to less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates—and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2008 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.

</span>“This is not QE,” Mr. Powell said. “In no sense is this QE.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed’s plan hasn’t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials’</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the “repo” market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16 and</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">With more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions—if allowed to fester—could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September’s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Market analysts said Mr. Powell’s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed’s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“This was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,” said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Fed’s next policy meeting is several weeks away “and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,” Mr. Powell said.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.

65d572b0bd09b873303e5916,87390,"<h3>Fixed mortgage rates are back down to February lows after sharp decline in bond yields and removal of unpopular refinance fee</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 80 lenders</span> nationwide to come up with weekly national averages.</span> It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with high credit scores and large down payments. Because of the criteria, these rates are not available to every borrower.
The survey is based on home purchase mortgages. Rates for refinances may be different.
The 15-year fixed-rate average decreased <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.12 percent</span> with an <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 0.7 point</span>. It <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 2.22 percent</span> a week ago <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.54 percent</span> a year ago. The five-year adjustable-rate average rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.49 percent</span> with an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 0.4 point</span>. It <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 2.47 percent</span> a week ago <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 3.09 percent</span> a year ago.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Mortgage rates fell sharply this week to their lowest level in months,” said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist.</span> “Less than a year after initially announcing it, the organization that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said last week that they would remove a policy that places an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 50 basis</span> point fee on mortgages that are being refinanced,” he added. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The program was intended to protect mortgage lenders from pandemic-driven losses, but it ultimately made it more expensive for homeowners to refinance their home loan and artificially increased the average mortgage rate.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rates immediately fell sharply on the announcement, a move that was extended later in the week as mounting concerns about the delta variant of covid-19 and its potential impact on expected economic growth led many investors to sell off stocks and seek the safe haven of bonds.”
</span>Borrowers wanting to refinance their mortgages received good news late last week. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that it was doing away with the adverse market refinance fee as of Aug.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span> The unpopular surcharge on refinances was announced last summer but not put in place until December. It was intended to offset covid-related losses suffered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The adjustment, which applied only to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinances, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.5 percent</span> of the loan amount. That added <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,500 to</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $300,000 loan</span>. According to FHFA data,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72 percent</span> of refinances were acquired by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2018 through</span> the first half <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“With less <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> of GSE loans in forbearance and continued home price appreciation resulting in significant borrower equity, there is no need for the fee,” said Bob Broeksmit, president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, suggested that borrowers would be wise to call several lenders before refinancing.
</span>“Lenders may use this as an opportunity to pad their own margins that have been squeezed by low rates and heated competition, so it is important for homeowners to seek out the lenders offering the best terms,” he said.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Monday’s dramatic stock market sell-off had investors fleeing to the safety of bonds, pushing prices up and yields down.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which started the month at<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>48 percent, plummeted to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>19 percent on Monday.</span> It rebounded to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>3 percent on Wednesday, back nearly to where it was on Friday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“A declining stock market, foreign demand for U.S. debt and the need for portfolio rebalancing by institutional players have all come together to bid up the price of 10-year Treasurys,” said Ken H. Johnson, a real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“This increased demand has pushed down 10-year yields significantly to levels that no one anticipated.”
Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that more than two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to go down in the coming week.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“Interest rates should ease lower with the lifting late last week of the adverse market fee and the drop in the 10-year Treasury after the Fed once again reinforced inflation as transitory,” said Gordon Miller, owner of Miller Lending Group.</span> “New concerns about the covid variant globally have also raised concerns of continued growth being slower than expected, so a return to the lows for the year [is] quite possible in the weeks ahead.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, mortgage applications slumped last week.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">decreased 4 percent</span> from a week earlier.</span> The refinance index <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3 percent</span>, while the purchase index <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 6 percent</span>. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 64.9 percent</span> of applications.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“On a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the July 4th holiday week, mortgage applications were lower across the board, with purchase applications back to near their lowest levels since <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2020,</span>” Joel Kan, an MBA economist, said in a statement.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Limited inventory and higher prices are keeping some prospective home buyers out of the market.</span> Refinance activity fell over the week, but because rates have stayed relatively low, the pace of applications was close to its highest level since early May.”

WeWorking Class America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful and Miserable The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers’ Rights</span> Why Aren’t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?
What happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents’ home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big — it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job — any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald’s, if it came to that.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon’s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.
Given a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? “It seemed kind of rude,” Hirasuna said. “Like, ‘Hey, here I am!’ ” A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. “It was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,” he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity — to do work he might actually like — in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.
Offices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.
And then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision — hover outside the boss’s office? don’t hover? — poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“When it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,” said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> “It’s moving in the dark without a flashlight.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show “Survivor.”</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as “autistic.” Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as “on the spectrum” or as “a person with autism.” “Just don’t call me late for dinner,” said one who did not have a preference.)
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues’ needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.
</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, “essentially to see if I can break it,” as Hirasuna put it.
<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children’s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, “that they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon’s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist’s start-up.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon’s marketing material names “pattern recognition” and “uncompromised honesty” as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations — even stereotypes — in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon’s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. “I realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don’t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,” he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? “ ‘That’s autism!’ ” Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. “ ‘O.K. — that’s what we expected!’ ”
One morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon’s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. “Oh, it drives my husband crazy, too,” she assured him. “But it helps me concentrate.” <span id=""20"" class=""red"">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)
</span>Musayaf’s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. “O.K.,” he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.
Later, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. “I knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,” she wrote. “We understand and respect each other.”
Musayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague’s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.
Musayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla’s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. “Look,” he said, “there is no correct way, or incorrect.” He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.
A culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam’s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.
</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But before she was put in charge of Auticon’s United States business in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2018,</span> she hadn’t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.
That Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening — they had been told to clear their desks — but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.
Another co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark’s founder), who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair would later prove popular — some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them — but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man’s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam’s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it’s pizza).
“People with my type of disorder, it’s not that we don’t have emotion,” Gadson said. “It’s that we have too much emotion. We can’t push that stuff back.”
Beam, as she started to understand the office’s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees’ boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems — a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum — call in to explain, in great detail, why they won’t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“You know, some employers would say to someone like that, ‘I’m done,’ ”</span> Beam said. “But I’m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.”
Beam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> “It was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious — I could see it — that he wasn’t able to process what it was he was being told,” she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">“I kind of like it here,” Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn’t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: “They accept me as I am.”
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.
</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. “Horus,” said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: “Halberd.” <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett’s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.
</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party — once. “It felt really claustrophobic,” he said. “I was like, O.K., I think I’ve had enough.” He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work — fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world’s worst meeting — interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.
The next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague — the one who had bristled in the meeting — that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: “I prefer this number:<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.87298334621.</span>” The note made her laugh, even though she wasn’t sure what it meant. “It’s the square root <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15,</span>” he told her. She burst out laughing again.
The conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. ”Don’t they look miserable?” Beam said. Kayla was indignant. “You know that at least some of them are introverts,” she said. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">It was almost as if they didn’t think their employees had feelings.

There was a time, not all that long ago, when the NFL seemed on the verge of expanding its playoff field <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 12 to</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14 teams</span>.
Then it didn’t happen. Not then. Not now.
Or at least not yet.
So what’s the deal? Will it ever happen?
That’s a very definite maybe.
In <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2014,</span> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the expanded playoffs to take effect in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>.
“I do believe it will be approved for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>[season],” Goodell said then.
[From May 2014: Roger Goodell expects the NFL to expand its playoffs beginning in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>]
He also said at that point: “I think we want to see one more year of, ‘Will it impact the regular season in a positive way from a competitive standpoint? Will it create more excitement, more races towards the end about who’s going to qualify for the playoffs?’ And we also want to absorb the additional inventory into the marketplace from an advertising standpoint. We’ll be able to do that. … So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that’s how we’re going to approach it.”
But then it didn’t happen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest.</span> And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.
[From February 2015: Support erodes for expanded NFL playoffs]
That doesn’t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It’s been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league’s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 CBA</span>.</span> The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players’ approval.
But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.
Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.
But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allowing 44 percent</span> of the league into the postseason rather than the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 38 percent</span>. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.
Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn’t mean that.
At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">either 17 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 games</span>, could be reconsidered, although the players’ approval remains the obvious obstacle there. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the expanded postseason could be reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The current labor deal runs <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2020,</span> and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.
… AND TEN<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span></span> Seahawks say no to Kaepernick … The Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They’d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.
[Kaepernick-to-the-Seahawks made a lot of sense]<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
2.</span> Next for Kaepernick?… It now becomes a waiting game for Kaepernick. Teams are into their offseason programs and there is no catalyst, it seems, to prompt a signing sooner rather than later. It now appears likely that it will be at least into training camp before a team reconsiders its quarterback options and Kaepernick becomes an alternative somewhere.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span></span> What about RGIII?<span id=""4"" class=""red"">… If Kaepernick can’t get a job, are there any prospects for Robert Griffin III?</span> Could a team justify passing up Kaepernick, coming off a 16-touchdown, four-interception season in San Francisco, in favor of Griffin, coming off a two-touchdown, three-interception season in Cleveland?
Of course, teams justified signing quarterbacks such as Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Fitzpatrick instead of Kaepernick. So perhaps signing Griffin wouldn’t be too much of a stretch.<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Seahawks’ strife … The Seahawks have done their best to try to dismiss the report by ESPN The Magazine about internal strife stemming from cornerback Richard Sherman’s inability to let go of the ill-fated play call on the goal line that led to Wilson’s Super Bowl-losing interception against the New England Patriots. Fine. It probably won’t be an issue if the Seahawks have a successful season. But if things don’t go so well, it won’t be as easy for them to put this aside.
[Yes, it was the worst play call in Super Bowl history]<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
5.</span> Ravens’ OTA injuries … Injuries obviously are part of football. But nothing is worse than injuries occurring in offseason practices. The Baltimore Ravens have been particularly hard hit this offseason with the torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered by cornerback Tavon Young and the hip injury, reportedly career threatening, suffered by tight end Dennis Pitta. Little to nothing is won in the NFL during the offseason. But plenty can be lost.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">6. Offseason restrictions … Keep such injuries in mind the next time NFL coaches talk about the need to roll back some of the restrictions on offseason practices put in place in the last labor deal.</span> The NFL Players Association is very, very unlikely to agree to any rollbacks of those restrictions.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
7.</span> On Norman … Josh Norman’s recent comments to Bleacher Report about Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr. were relatively tame, by his standards. Norman can say what he wants. But, really, has he played well enough since moving from the Carolina Panthers to the Washington Redskins to justify such inflammatory remarks? Not really taking a stand on that. Just wondering.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
8.</span> On Cruz … Norman’s comments came nowhere close to those made recently by Victor Cruz, however, after the veteran wide receiver signed with the Chicago Bears. Does Cruz really believe that the New York Giants purposefully suppressed his pass-catching numbers to make it easier to release him? This was a team that was starved for offensive production after a successful remake of its defense. If Cruz really believes that, he is deluding himself badly.
[Victor Cruz felt Giants intentionally kept <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2016 production</span> down. Former coach disagrees.]<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

A Flying Elephant, a Teacher’s Hugs:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience
The virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.
As much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience — of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.
BRAZIL
“I am yearning for your hug. . .”
. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.
They had <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.
Students with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.
But the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.
Ms. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.
Her first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves — but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.
Then she came up with the idea of a pandemic “hugging kit” — disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.
The response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?
She rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.
“Distance can’t destroy what we have built,” Ms. Silva,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. “I needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I’m not able to hold them every morning.”
The kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon’s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.
Yasmim Vitória de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.
“She’s playful and she lets us have fun,” the 9-year-old said.
Ms. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.
“In a moment of tragedy, we’ve been able to share moments of love,” Ms. Silva said. “That is very powerful — Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni
INDIA
When India’s lockdown hit . . .
. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.
For years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India’s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.
When all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.
So Mr. Sahu,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn’t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.
“My mental condition was one of a mad person,” Mr. Sahu said. “When I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, ‘We have not eaten in days.’ It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.”
A spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.
When asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.
“Who else would take care of them?” he said. — Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj
ITALY
When an Italian bookstore appealed . . .
. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.
“We wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,” said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.
The idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers — and with luck a few volunteers — would read to people for <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. “We were thinking small,” she said.
But the response was overwhelming.
After the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.
Ms. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.
Ms. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she’d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.
In France, Paméla Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. “We managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,” Ms. Boittiaux said.
Ms. Romanese’s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.
“In a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,” she said. — Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden
BELARUS
When I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .
. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.
How he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country’s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk’s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.
</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. “All in all, I’m healthy and I’m free, which by today’s standards is quite something,” he said.
The doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.
Their authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.
But even as the president wouldn’t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing — a “people’s quarantine,” some called it.
One tech company, on Dr. Vitushka’s advice, bought <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.
After the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.
“All these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,” Dr. Vitushka told me. “And here we all came together in the face of a threat.”
For now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year’s pain — both for him and for his country — has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.
“We’re living through an intense coming-of-age period,” he said. “If I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.” — Anton Troianovski
CHINA
He has fostered more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .
. . . <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua’s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.
On Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.
Earlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week’s worth of food and water for their cats at home.
Please, they begged, could he help?
It was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city’s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.
But Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or “Old Cat,” did not hesitate.
“I just knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything,” he recalled. “It’s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.”
Almost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.
He wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.
<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats — and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.
“It was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,” Mr. Shuai said. “Looking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.”

Iran
The teacher had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .
. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.
For good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">children<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.
Some of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.
But Mr. Asadi,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> has <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.
“They told me, ‘You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher’s salary,’” Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. “But for me seeing the sweet smile on the children’s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.”
Overnight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.
He has also inspired others to act.
State-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.
</span>“Creating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,” Mr. Asadi said. — Farnaz Fassihi
BOLIVIA
The women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .
. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.
For months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women’s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn’t have to. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.
</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.
Sometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.
The death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.
“I wasn’t afraid to die,” she said. “Dying for me is a blessing, because I’m on the Lord’s path.” — Julie Turkewitz
CAMBODIA
When an elephant has to travel by plane. . .
. . . a lot of preparation is required.
It is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don’t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.
Now try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.
But on Nov.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.
Sent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.
Elephants are social creatures, and Kavaan’s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.
The trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.
Days before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.
Luckily, Kavaan’s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.
“2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,” said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, “and releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.” — Hannah Beech
KENYA
The calls and messages just kept coming . . .
. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi’s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food — or much of anything, really.
For many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.
Since it began, the project has raised more <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.
Ms. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.
“It changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,” Ms. Jaffar,<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. “There was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.”
But some parts of the story have been slower to change.
In April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.
“They didn’t stop until I said we were actually giving out food — ‘I am a community worker,’” she recalled.
Ms. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.
“We learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,” she said. — Abdi Latif Dahir
CHINA
She moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .
. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.
In late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.
Thousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hands 20 to</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.
Then, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor’s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor’s door.
That gave Ms. Guo an idea.
With friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.
She named her fledgling campaign “little vaccines against domestic violence,” and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.
Within hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag “little vaccines against domestic violence” has been viewed more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.
People across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.
The outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.
“Many people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,” Ms. Guo said, “but also because we’re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.”
Wuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.
</span>“It’s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,” she said. “So the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?” — Vivian Wang
<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MEXICO
2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .
. . . for Lucía Riojas Martínez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.
An outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.
But then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. “Remember what you have to do tomorrow,” she told herself.
At the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.
But lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country’s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.
And so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.
Ms. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn’t enough, that there was a “mental and emotional health crisis in the community,” she said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.
“More than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,” Ms. Riojas said.
Run largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
“Every day we know that the road gets harder, but we can’t take a step backward,” she said. “It’s forward — and it’s together.” — Oscar Lopez
BRITAIN
At <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .
. . . but now comes the reward.
In recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.
Then, the coronavirus came to Britain.
With older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard’s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.
For a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.
“It is frustrating because I live alone,” he said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“And you get fed up with your own company.”
</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.
Then, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.
“I was most surprised,” he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">day 1 of</span> Britain’s mass inoculation program. “I’ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.”
Mr. Pollard’s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. “Honestly, he’s my hero, nobody believes he’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 90,</span>” she said. “He’s just genuinely so kindhearted.”
Now, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy — to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family
“The worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,” Mr. Pollard said.
Now, at least for him, it has. — Megan Specia

</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government’s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation

WASHINGTON—The government accuses the company’s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film “Casablanca.” The company likens the government’s case to a shaved Persian cat, “pale and thin.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.
It could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as
Alphabet Inc.’s
Google and
Facebook Inc.
Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.
</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren’t head-to-head competitors. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They want to combine AT&T’s video-distribution network with Time Warner’s content—from HBO’s “Game of Thrones” to the NCAA basketball tournament—in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.
</span>“This will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,” said Wayne State University law professor
Stephen Calkins,
“and what the court says will be terribly important.”

The case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss
Randall Stephenson
and U.S. antitrust chief
Makan Delrahim.
Mr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.
Mr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal—the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,
Amazon.com Inc.,
Hulu and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube. Younger customers increasingly watch video on phones, tablets and laptops.
The upheaval has left the pay-TV industry scrambling. Mr. Stephenson made <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $49 billion</span> play for video distribution by acquiring DirecTV, the top U.S. pay-TV satellite service, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> He’s now trying to make the company’s wireless and video bundles more attractive to viewers and investors by adding Time Warner news, sports and entertainment assets to the package.
Given Mr. Delrahim’s objections, the deal has been pending <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 17 months</span>, creating something of an industry chessboard frozen in time, with competitors uncertain of their next play. Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.’s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with
Walt Disney Co.
instead. (Journal parent company News Corp and
21st Century Fox
share common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as
Comcast
and
Verizon Communications Inc.
and clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.

Question of competition
The case raises this central question: If AT&T buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.
Mr. Delrahim’s team says yes. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and “American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.”
</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren’t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner’s content, especially the Turner networks—including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV—are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner’s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.

On the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn’t be so willing under AT&T. “With the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,” it says in filings.
AT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast’s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of “behavioral” conditions.
AT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone’s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. “AT&T and Time Warner aren’t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,” the companies say.
AT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn’t remedy the merger’s harms to competition.
Where Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T’s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers’ interests and preferences.

</span>Bad blood
High-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.
Mr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim’s motives and cited a television interview <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn’t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.
The two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President
Donald Trump,
as a carrot to win Justice Department approval.
Mr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.
The Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson’s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film “Casablanca,” quoting his famous line, “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”
People close to AT&T’s management say the department’s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable statements.
AT&T, in its own brief, said the department’s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: “Now, what remains of the government’s case, ‘like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,’ ” borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 case</span>.
That choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 19.</span> This isn’t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger’s fate.
The Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.
AT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO
Jeff Bewkes,
about what they see as the deal’s benefits.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor
Carl Shapiro,
who served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>.
</span>Judge Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, is expected to rule in the next few months. The companies extended their merger agreement from <span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 22 to</span> <span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 21 to</span> give him more time.
Mr. Trump’s comments hang over the case. After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn’t comment on the litigation, then added: “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.”

There is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump’s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the “elephant in the room” when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.
Mr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn’t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump’s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T’s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn’t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.
Judge Leon’s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.
The AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company—and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $4 billion</span>.
</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department’s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump’s comments about the deal.
The Justice Department has been riding a decade’s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.
Mr. Delrahim’s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,

Want more stories about how health-care policy affects you? Read Paige Winfield Cunningham.
Americans are flocking to Healthcare.gov in greater numbers than ever before in a development that runs precisely contrary to the doom-and-gloom everyone had predicted for this enrollment season.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">I think it’s safe to say that last year, the Obama administration would have pretty much killed for the shockingly brisk pace of Obamacare signups in the first four days the federal health insurance website opened for business.
</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced yesterday that more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600,000 people</span> selected plans from Nov.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 through</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.</span> Those figures appear quite a bit higher than last year, when just over a million people selected plans in the first dozen days (the best comparison available at this point). More than one in five of those people —<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 137,322 </span>— were new enrollees.
That’s despite the Trump administration’s much cooler attitude toward Healthcare.gov and Obamacare more generally. It seems certain the administration was trying to undercut enrollment figures by halting TV and radio advertising for the open enrollment season, chopping off navigator fund for groups that help people sign up and doing only the bare minimum to let people know they can start shopping.

In the face of suppressed outreach from Trump...
I should emphasize that it’s still just the very beginning of the six-week signup period -- and way too early to know how this year will turn out in comparison to years past. But the initial trajectory is one that virtually no one predicted.
Let’s explore a few reasons why this might be:<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> More Americans can get more generous subsidies this year.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">This is a phenomenon stemming from Trump’s decision to cut off extra payments to insurers for cost-sharing reductions they must offer.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">We elaborated on this effect in Monday’s The <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202,</span></span> but here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: To make up for losing the payments, many insurers hiked prices for their mid-grade “silver plans.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And because premium subsidies are based on silver plan prices, the subsidies are going up too, making bronze and gold plans even cheaper for many low-income people.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I really believe the availability of these very low-cost plans could be a game changer,” said Josh Peck, who served as Healthcare.gov’s chief marketing officer under Obama and now heads up the group Get America Covered.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Enrollees eligible for subsidies will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $555 on</span> average to offset the cost of their plans, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 45 percent</span> from this year’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $382 average</span> tax credit, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
</span>Point 2: It would be even <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">better 4 ppl</span> of all incomes & geos if Trump hadn't created uncertainty, repressed competition/enrollment, etc. 7/— Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>2</span>. People with a Healthcare.gov account are still getting reminder emails.
I know this because I created an account several years ago. I’ve received at least four reminder emails in the last week, telling me I should visit the website to search for a plan. So have others:
NYT's Margot Sanger-Katz:
https://t.co/FKjaESoJ24 is sending signup reminders, with details on the open enrollment period. I just got this one. pic.twitter.com/gIGSS2R9U5— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>Over</span> the last four years, the Obama administration created a large database of email addresses for past and current enrollees. Even though it appears the Trump administration isn’t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past – like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around – email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span> Maybe brokers are kicking butt.
Before the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they’d helped enroll an <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 40 to</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50 percent</span> of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 43 percent</span> of new enrollments on the state’s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment.
The Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration’s refusal to promote the law.
EHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span>, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage.
“Web-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,” the company’s CEO Scott Flanders told me. “So it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.”<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it.
If the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won’t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that’s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn’t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said.
“Outreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,” Peck said.

AHH: There’s an expensive big fight brewing between two powerful lobbies -- hospitals and drug makers -- around an obscure drug discount program called 340B, Politico's David Pittman reports. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The program is supposed to help rural and charity hospitals by offsetting the cost of medicines for these low-income providers with discounted drugs.</span> But 340B has grown exponentially, now <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprising $16 billion</span> worth of medications dispensed in hospitals every year.
""Drug companies have gone on offense,"" David writes. ""In paid advertising, messaging through an army of lobbyists and on-the-record briefing of reporters, the pharmaceutical industry has crafted a message that hospitals are taking <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $6 billion</span> in drug discounts and using it to enrich themselves rather than help poor patients. They say the 340B cash has even played a role in hospitals buying up doctors’ offices, causing a rise in health care costs that more than cancels out any benefit of the drug discounts.""
“It seems to be a perversion of this program that patients might be paying more today than they would have prior,” Lori Reilly, PhRMA executive vice president, told reporters recently. “The goal of 340B was to lower costs to patients, not increase them.”
""Hospitals deny that characterization,"" David continues. ""But it’s caught the attention of at least some on the Hill. Congressional offices are drafting bills that would more tightly limit how hospitals use the discounts...The lobbying has escalated fast. <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 160 organizations</span>, almost all drug companies, hospitals and community health centers, reported lobbying on 340B last quarter, spending a <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined $41.8 million</span>, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms.""
OOF: A provision in the annual defense authorization bill has sparked a fiery debate over whether the Pentagon should be allowed to authorize the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices for combat soldiers, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
Under existing law, the FDA is the only agency that can authorize the use of medical products -- but the Defense Department can request that the FDA grant approval if there's a threat of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent on the battlefield. The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order “to reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.”
The two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.
OUCH: ""God only knows"" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is “exploiting” human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a “social-validation feedback loop,” Parker said, adding that it is “exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.”
Parker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself ""something of a conscientious objector,"" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. “I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=""7"" class=""red"">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,” Parker said.
</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month. Parker said that when he was helping Facebook get off the ground <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> he and others involved thought: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?”
“And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,"" he said. ""And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you . . . more likes and comments.”
--President Trump, who has blamed China for Americans' increased access to fentanyl, said yesterday he discussed reducing the flow of drugs into the United States with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said that he and the president would be ""focusing on it very strongly,"" without elaborating further.
“Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” Trump said standing alongside Xi, Reuters reported. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,"" the president said.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He added that a ‘special emphasis” would be placed on fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50 to</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 times</span> more addictive than heroin.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later added that Xi ""committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information.""</span> But last week, China’s drug control agency denied Trump’s claim that most fentanyl is produced in China.
-- Meanwhile, the DEA announced yesterday it's taking steps to make it easier to prosecute fentanyl traffickers by temporarily scheduling all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis. That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.
Late last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.
--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare. Starting today, the company will host events to help drivers sign up for marketplace plans in more than two dozen cities from Los Angeles to Indianapolis, Reuters reported.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The company, which employs <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 600,000 U</span>.S. drivers, said <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 150,000 drivers</span> had looked <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2017 insurance</span> plans through its partnership with the consultant group Stride Health.</span> ""This year we’re doubling down on that,” Uber spokeswoman Meghan Joyce told Reuters. The company heavily relies on freelance and contract workers -- a key target population for marketplace enrollments.
--Jimmy Kimmel facetiously celebrated the huge Healthcare.gov enrollment figures for finally allowing him and the president to agree on something.
""I have taken issue with a great many things Donald Trump has done as president but I have to admit, it hasn’t all been bad. In fact, yesterday I was looking at the White House website, healthcare.gov specifically, and I have to admit the health care plan there isn't bad. It's actually pretty good,” Kimmel said on his show Wednesday night.

As Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers
A wide-ranging presidential order helped block a railroad merger and tackle supply-chain problems, and it is planting the seeds for bigger actions.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — As rising inflation threatens his presidency, President Biden is turning to the federal government’s antitrust authorities to try to tame red-hot price increases that his administration believes are partly driven by a lack of corporate competition.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has prodded the Agriculture Department to investigate large meatpackers that control a significant share of poultry and pork markets, accusing them of raising prices, underpaying farmers — and tripling their profit margins during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As gas prices surged, he publicly encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate accusations that large oil companies had artificially inflated prices, behavior that the administration says continued even after global oil prices began to fall in recent weeks.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The push has extended to little-known agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission, which the president has urged to search for price gouging by large shipping companies at the heart of the supply chain.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The turn to antitrust levers stems from Mr. Biden’s belief that rising levels of corporate concentration in the U.S. economy have empowered a few large players in each industry to raise prices higher than a more competitive market would allow.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Corporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.
</span>White House officials concede that their antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately. The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden’s competition agenda.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year’s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.

-</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Psychology of Inflation: Americans are flush with cash and jobs, but they also think the economy is awful.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The administration’s focus on increasing competition “will spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,” said Brian Deese, who heads the White House’s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And, he added, it “will deliver lower prices for Americans right away.”
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The president’s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,” Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">“Did they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden’s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.
</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were “harming competition in the U.S. economy.”
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration’s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation’s ports and to highlight the companies’ promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.
Overall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden’s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.
</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">Inflation F.A.Q.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">What is inflation?</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world’s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">The commission’s analysis determined that market forces — particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out — are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> “I think it has upped our credibility” with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.
Perhaps the administration’s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">“We’re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,” the report said.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">“Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.”
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“The White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,” said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute’s president.
</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and “Big Meat” has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack’s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.
Mr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden’s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.
“These markets have been concentrated for a long time,” said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. “He didn’t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he’s going to fix it now?”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency’s new “Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program” that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.
</span>“The Biden administration understands this and knows this,” said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, “I would like to see more.”",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,
65d572b0bd09b873303e5916,15267,"<h3>Elizabeth Warren: The Federal Reserve Is Trying ‘To Get More People Fired’</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is coming under increasing political pressure to stop raising interest rates as aggressively as it has done so this year.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced another rate hike Wednesday as Democrats worry Powell’s monetary policy will cause a recession.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He’s pushing hard to get more people fired because he thinks that is one way to help bring down inflation,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“But it’s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.
</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Powell has openly admitted that there’s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But the members of the Fed’s board of governors said they think they’ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed’s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year ― still historically high but down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.2% in</span> September.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Powell described the current strength of the labor market as an obstacle to reducing inflation on Wednesday.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Job growth is very high, wages are very high, vacancies are quite elevated and really there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand,” Powell told reporters.</span> “So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Fed can’t do anything about supply problems caused by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, as Powell has repeatedly admitted.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The only thing the Fed can affect through interest rates is aggregate demand in the economy, and it will take an unknown number of months for consumers to feel the impact.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">At a hearing earlier this year, Warren questioned Powell about whether higher interest rates would reduce prices for food or fuel, and he said they would not.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“The chairman of the Fed has admitted to me in a hearing that those rate hikes will not affect the price of groceries, will not bring down the cost of energy, because of the other forces that have driven up prices,” Warren said.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“The moderation in inflation is one more reminder that we need a lot of data about where prices are moving, and we need it over a longer period of time before the Fed hauls off and takes yet again extremist actions to raise interest rates.”</span>",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 5,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET

WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Fears that the El Niño weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.

</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Niño is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Niño will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yields for Australian wheat—which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprise 14% of</span> the world’s exports—could fall as much <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.

El Niño occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Niño event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.

</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">El Niño caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.

</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be. Of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 26 El</span> Niño weather patterns observed <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1900,</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 17 resulted</span> in widespread droughts in Australia, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology.

“Every El Niño is different, including its duration and intensity, as is its impact on agricultural production,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They said the price impact could be deepest for robusta coffee—used in instant coffee—raw sugar and wheat, crops grown in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil that are likely to be affected by El Niño.

</span>Garry Hansen, a farmer who grows wheat as well as raises cattle and sheep on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8,000</span>-hectare farm in Coomandook in southern Australia, is already concerned about the area’s dryness. The region has had little rain over the last two years.

“We don’t have a lot of moisture in the bank and we are a little bit worried about the forecast. We could do with the rain,” said Mr. Hansen, who added June’s rainfall was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20% of</span> its normal level. He said making sure there were no weeds taking water away from the wheat crop was one of the few things he could do to combat El Niño.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“You have to manage the business like it is going to rain but you also have to maximize water efficiency,” said Mr. Hansen.

Wheat exported from Brisbane on Australia’s eastern coast, near to farmland that could be most affected by El Niño, is already trading at a premium of more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% to</span> wheat shipped from Adelaide in South Australia, said Rob Imray, managing director at commodity marketing firm Farmarco Australia.

</span>It may take a few months before El Niño’s impact is felt in other agricultural commodities. Palm-oil harvests will be affected by drier weather, but the extent won’t be visible until six months after El Niño occurs, Singapore-based Golden Agri-Resources, the second-largest producer of the commodity, said in an email.

“As El Niño has just started, it is currently too early to estimate production output <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2016,</span>” the company said. It said palm-oil farmers could apply fertilizer to their land earlier than normal to help counter any worsening of weather conditions.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">El Niño could boost trading firms that act as middlemen between buyers and sellers of food.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such firms tend to profit more when commodity prices are volatile—provided they read weather and market conditions correctly.

</span>“We are watching [the situation] like a hawk and we will see what happens,” Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Singapore-based trader Olam, said earlier this year. He said El Niño could lead to shortages of wheat, corn and sugar in some Southern Hemisphere countries, although higher rainfall could help crops elsewhere.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Market fears about the impact of El Niño have eased due to a good start to the monsoon season in India and Bangladesh, said Aurelia Britsch, senior commodities analyst at BMI Research.</span> The monsoon season has brought more rain than normal despite earlier forecasts that India’s rainfall would be down <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 12%,</span> while the weather in northern parts of Asia has been broadly in line with historical averages.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Any upward pressure on food prices from El Niño could also be offset by ample stocks of several commodities, particularly of rice, palm oil and sugar, some analysts say.

</span>And while dry conditions could weigh on crop yields in Asia, wetter weather caused by El Niño in South America could boost crops of soybeans, corn and sugar there.

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET

U.S. stocks’</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.

Assets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $50.3 billion</span> in September. The ETF has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">advanced 5.1% over</span> the past month.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Value stocks, often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth, saw the largest divergence in performance from their growth-focused counterparts this decade, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study that looked at the first half of September.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors have pared positions in technology stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns in recent years.

</span>Funds tracking momentum stocks, those that investors are purchasing because they have been rising, recorded last week their first significant outflows since March of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And one of the biggest momentum-focused ETFs has edged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.4% over</span> the past month, underperforming the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> which has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 4.2%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves are the latest sign of how a jumble of contradictory data has investors grappling with two divergent paths for the U.S. economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A recovery from a soft patch in growth would, in theory, boost companies such as financials and energy companies, whose shares have underperformed broader markets over the years.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But an economy weakened by protracted trade conflicts and slowing growth abroad would likely push the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy, providing a tailwind for Treasurys and growth stocks.

</span>Many investors are opting for a nuanced approach. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Hugo Rogers, who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $5 billion</span> as chief investment strategist at Deltec International Group, said his fund this month trimmed positions in Treasurys and gold and picked up shares of oil drillers, including Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. Shares of the S&P 500’s energy sector have zipped past the broader index in the past month, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 8.5%.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We are trading what we think are the early stages of a reversal, and watching out for a bigger reversal that can last for many years,” he said.

</span>A confluence of factors is driving the most recent shift. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many are worried that the world’s biggest central banks are unlikely to loosen monetary policy much further.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Rates in Europe and Japan are already at or near historic lows, while the Fed has signaled that its latest rate cuts are unlikely to be followed by a long easing cycle.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That could spell bad news for the big, momentum-driven technology stocks, which have been a key engine for the market’s gains in recent years.</span> Some of the largest tech stocks have lost steam. Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2016.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 shed</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.8%.</span>

</span>Momentum stocks haven’t been as widely held as they are now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.

</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.

</span>Momentum trades “worked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,” Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span>

Still, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.

</span>“It’s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. “It’s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.”

Yet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn’t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2001.</span>

</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. “A lot of people don’t understand that value cannot die,” she said.

Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world
Bank reserves are normally obscure, even to bankers and professional investors.</span> But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs—known as the overnight repo rate—to spike. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a worry, because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> but it shot up almost as high <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% on</span> Tuesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market.</span> That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">To settle markets down, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has dipped into this market, conducting three auctions this week where banks could swap Treasurys (or bonds from institutions like Fannie Mae ) for new reserves.</span> It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $75 billion</span> in repos.
Here’s is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they’ve come to matter.
What are reserves?
Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.
Central bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called “reserves.” The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.
There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.
What are reserves for?
The main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.
But that’s not what really happens. In fact, the first person’s bank reduces the amount in the person’s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person’s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don’t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.
</span>Where do reserves come from?
One way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Whether it wants to pay government workers’ wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government’s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.
Where does QE come in?
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of QE—quantitative easing—was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.
</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.
</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer’s bank account disappears.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.
</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?
This is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn’t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.
Newsletter Sign-up
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">If banks don’t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn’t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn’t yet been identified.

The upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.
The final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.
The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.
In the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC’s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.
Kickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time — 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there’s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl’s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.
Outside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L’Équipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).
After the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year’s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.
Local sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.
Now, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.
“When you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,” Demoff said.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“You get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.”
Temperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.
It’s been <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.
Across the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.
SoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.
Here are where temperature records were broken in 2021:
A common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, has been that this year’s Super Bowl is “just another game.”
“Obviously it’s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,” Burrow said after Friday’s practice, the last of the season.
Their opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year’s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.
But despite the Bengals’ relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
He said that he and Duke Tobin, the team’s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.
“They certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments — they have proven that over the last two months,” Taylor said. “It’s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we’ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.”
Nine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.
When Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.
Miller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.
Blocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals’ offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.
Burrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams’ pass rush if the Bengals can’t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ticket prices for this year’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.
The Bengals play in one of the league’s smallest markets, but their fans haven’t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).
While the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.
All fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.
Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor “mega” events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.
Away from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.
“You’re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,” Sikka said. “You should test to go to your Super Bowl party.”",,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,

Clinton attacks the GOP on climate change. But her plan has a glaring gap.
HILLARY CLINTON has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago — and it has a glaring gap.
Ms. Clinton’s proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn’t taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy.</span> On this, Ms. Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.
Ms. Clinton’s strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Obama’s greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Mr. Obama’s promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 26 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 28 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> increase renewables <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> of the power grid <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2030.</span> Ms. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2027,</span> with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.
To get there, Ms. Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions, a concept that resembles Mr. Obama’s Race to the Top education initiative. She would invest in more energy research and development. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She would also use the tax code to subsidize investment in or electricity production from renewable energy sources, extending and reforming the renewables tax subsidies already on the books.
</span>Yet it’s curious that Ms. Clinton didn’t offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them. Others could include nuclear power or careful use of natural gas in the medium term. What matters is not how the country slashes its emissions but that it does so — and as cheaply as possible.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country’s complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions.</span> This wouldn’t tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Market behavior would therefore become much more rational: Businesses and consumers would use electricity more carefully; the market appeal of low-carbon energy technologies would reflect their real value; government planners would have less influence over the country’s energy future.
</span>The drawbacks are all political. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The term “carbon tax” doesn’t play well.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Cap and trade” has been smeared.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet Ms. Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.</span> Giving the policy its due would hardly be the most politically unrealistic campaign proposal a candidate has offered. Yet it would be among the most reasonable.

65d572b0bd09b873303e5916,28210,"<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball’s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 111 losses</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.
Everywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like “leadership,” “trust” and “desire” filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.
It was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise’s first World Series <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span>
But on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport’s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.
The shock waves have been seismic. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets — all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers’ signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.
</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing “to determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.”
For some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers — whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— tweeted on Thursday: “I would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.”
Wood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.
“The word that keeps popping into my mind is ‘unfathomable,’” said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. “Maybe that’s me being naïve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.”
Suspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.
On Oct.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.
Yet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.
In the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros’ acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.
Taubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.
Houston’s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team’s hierarchy and demoted Ryan’s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.
</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team’s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher’s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.
Over the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s investigators <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.
Even before The Athletic’s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers’ subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.
But they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston’s hitters but sensed something shady.
“When you’d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,” Vogt said. “As a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn’t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.”
It was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While power hitters generally strike out frequently — a trade-off for swinging aggressively — the Astros’ lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 1910 through</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> only two teams — <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians — led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">both 2017 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span>
“I don’t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,” said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros’ hitting coach, explaining the team’s philosophy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: “If you go in with that mind-set, you’re not going to miss your pitch as often.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros’ scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have — possibly costing players money and jobs.
</span>“Now you’re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down” to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, “because they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?”
The Astros’ players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.
“It’s time for the players involved to step forward,” the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. “Take your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there’s some integrity still in you somewhere.”
The ‘model organization’ created a firestorm.
The Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros’ owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.
Some in the Astros’ organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Luhnow, who has a master’s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team’s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team’s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“One of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,” he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> “Depth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.”
Luhnow — who did not respond to an interview request for this article — inherited a team with the majors’ worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.
“The players couldn’t understand why the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">best 25 guys</span> weren’t breaking camp with us,” said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014.</span> “We tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we’d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.”
Even before the N.B.A.’s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word “process” as a euphemism for tanking — a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston’s attendance sank <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team’s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball’s analytical and technological revolution.
“To me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,” said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros’ radio play-by-play voice <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2006 through</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012.</span> “They brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.”
The results began revealing themselves <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros’ database had been hacked by the Cardinals’ scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.
Correa eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.
In hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa — who declined an interview request — could not resist commenting. “Guess who isn’t surprised?” he tweeted.
Baseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros’ explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before — as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.
In the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington’s wins came at the Astros’ park in Houston.
Sign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology. M.L.B. officers monitor video replay rooms now — they did not do so <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and the league will most likely reinforce its rules with prominent signage in clubhouses.
But the Astros’ scandal has brought the issue to a crossroads: Should baseball run from technology to crack down on cheating, or lean into it? League officials are considering a ban on players’ looking at live video during games, yet they are also working on prototypes of electronic signs between catchers and pitchers, though nothing is considered close to game-ready.
Those will not be the only efforts to beat back the Astros’ influence. The M.L.B. players’ union hopes to discourage tanking in the next collective bargaining agreement, and the Astros’ model may already be losing its appeal. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most imitators have not seen the same results, and this winter’s robust free-agent market — after two slow off-seasons — seems to indicate that more teams are trying to be competitive.
</span>The Astros should still be a force on the field this season, if their talent can overcome the organizational upheaval, the public skepticism over their achievements and the newfound awkwardness of their place within the players’ fraternity. In any case, the scandal has disgraced the dominant team of this era — and threatens to swallow up the game.
“None of us, if we looked ourselves in the mirror, would have said, ‘Wow, these guys are morally corrupt, these guys are cheaters,’” said one general manager, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss another team. “Let’s not kid ourselves, they were the model organization. But we know more now.”

Moscow insisted that it would not sell oil that is subject to a price limit agreed upon by the Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span>, even if it means cutting production, adding to questions over whether the plan, which goes into effect on Monday, will succeed in slowing Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span> on Friday agreed to cap the price of Russian crude <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $60 a</span> barrel, putting into place a complex, U.S.-backed plan to limit what Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, can charge for its oil exports.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin’s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules.</span> He said that Russia was “working on mechanisms” to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,” he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union’s embargo on Russian crude imports.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production — which would also harm Russia’s economy — questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression.</span> Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan’s architects were “trying to avoid hard decisions.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $70 a</span> barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $30 a</span> barrel to significantly slash Russia’s revenue.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,
Mr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“The logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $60 instead</span> of, for example,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $30,</span> which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $100 billion</span> a year,” Mr. Zelensky said.
</span>“This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia’s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,” he continued. “This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions.”
The United States had led the push for an agreement along the lines of what was ultimately negotiated. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">After the deal was announced, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen praised the plan.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">It helped “achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,” she said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Western sanctions have so far failed to weaken Moscow’s energy exports: Russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sales than <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">E.U. diplomats have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 countries</span> and allies.
</span>OPEC and its allies, including Russia, said on Sunday that they would leave their quotas for oil production unchanged. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The group, known as OPEC Plus, appears to have decided during a teleconference that there was no reason to alter policy amid the many uncertainties in the oil market.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">On Monday, the European Union will begin an embargo on Russian oil, while the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 industrialized</span> nations and their allies are imposing a price cap <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $60 a</span> barrel on Russian crude.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The looming embargo and the price cap were the chief reasons for the producers’ group to hold its fire.</span> What the outcome of these initiatives will be for oil markets is still to be determined, but they could affect millions of barrels a day of Russian oil. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">OPEC may have decided that it was better off keeping its collective head down rather than risk being blamed if, for instance, prices jump in the coming days.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The coming weeks may see an interplay between the growing difficulties that Russia is likely to have in selling its oil and the effects of a slowing global economy.</span> China will be a key factor. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Lockdowns there are reducing demand for imports.</span> But widespread protests against those restrictions have been followed by some easing of the “zero Covid” rules, offering some hope of a gradual easing and a bounce back in consumption of fuel.
At the moment the oil markets are betting that these momentous shifts can be handled smoothly. But they may be wrong.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">The State of the War
- Russian Oil Price Cap: The E.U. agreed on a $60-a-barrel limit for Russian oil, the latest effort by Western allies to try to deprive Moscow of revenue to finance its war in Ukraine.</span> Here’s how it will work.
- A Pivotal Point: Ukraine is on the offensive, but with about one-fifth of its territory still occupied by Russian forces, there is still a long way to go — and the onset of winter will bring new difficulties.
- Ukraine’s Power Grid: As many Ukrainians head into winter without power or water, crews are racing to restore Ukraine’s battered energy infrastructure, but Russian airstrikes threaten to undo such efforts.
Ukrainian soldiers have raised the national flag at a location on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region, according to a video published by a Ukrainian military unit, an apparent sign of Kyiv’s intent to press its counteroffensive in the south.
The video, released on Saturday, did not indicate that Ukraine had established a permanent military presence on the east bank, which is controlled by Russian forces. Nor did it indicate any concerted effort by Ukrainian forces who recently reclaimed Kherson city to push across the river and attack Russian defensive positions.
But analysts said the video, posted on Telegram by a detachment of the Ukrainian military’s “Carlson” air intelligence unit, signaled Ukraine’s desire to show it would continue its southern counteroffensive even as falling temperatures make fighting more challenging, and as Russian forces continue to fire from their eastern positions toward Kherson city.
The video, set to swelling music and apparently filmed with the intention of sending a message, shows soldiers on three speedboats crossing the river, which is hundreds of yards wide, and docking at an abandoned wooden jetty on an island where small civilian boats were moored. Aerial footage shows the Ukrainian flag draped from high on a crane in the wharf, which the video says is in Olezhky, a district opposite Kherson city. The timing and authenticity of the footage could not be independently confirmed.
“This flag was raised by the fighters of the ‘Carlson’ special unit. It will become a bridgehead for the de-occupation of the left bank of the Kherson region,” an unidentified man in military fatigues said. The left bank refers to the river’s eastern bank.
The area on which the troops landed appeared to be empty, which is consistent with previous Ukrainian and other military reports that Russian forces had largely pulled back from the shoreline northeast of the city of Kherson. The location appeared to be a low-lying, swampy area with few roads, which analysts say Russian forces were unlikely to defend — and which was not a logical starting point for a Ukrainian military push.
Still, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said that if confirmed, the “limited Ukrainian incursion onto the east bank could open avenues for Ukrainian forces to begin to operate on the east bank.”
When Ukraine entered Kherson city three weeks ago after Russian forces withdrew — a watershed moment in the nine-month war — its troops secured the whole of the western bank of the river in the region. The next phase of their counteroffensive in the south would likely involve pushing across the river and trying to reclaim land that stretches south to the coast and leads to Crimea, the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
On Saturday, Ukrainian officials issued an urgent call for civilians to leave Russian-occupied areas on the eastern bank because of “the possible intensification of hostilities in this area.”
Several factors, however, have made further progress uncertain for Ukraine. The river presents a formidable barrier, and the main bridge across, the Antonivsky, is destroyed. Analysts also say that Russian forces withdrew largely intact from Kherson and have spent weeks digging defensive barriers on the eastern side of the Dnipro. The onset of winter, too, has made military operations more difficult, both in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are defending territory they have seized in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
“We’re seeing kind of a reduced tempo, already, of the conflict,” Avril D. Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday. She said that the pace of Ukrainian operations would likely pick up in the spring.
Small units of Ukrainian troops have, for weeks, been running sabotage operations on the river’s eastern bank, laying mines and staging ambushes. At the same time, Russia has been lobbing shells across the river at the city of Kherson and at villages to the north.
On Saturday, one person was killed and two others were injured in a barrage of Russian shelling, said the head of Kherson’s regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, on the Telegram social messaging app.
PARIS — An “essential point” in any peace talks on the war in Ukraine should be how to provide security “guarantees to Russia,” given Moscow’s concerns over NATO, President Emmanuel Macron of France has said.
Mr. Macron’s remarks, in a television interview broadcast on Saturday, picked up a theme he has pursued since before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> but has not repeated of late. “We need to prepare what we are ready to do, how we protect our allies and member states, and how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table,” Mr. Macron said.
“One of the essential points we must address — as President Putin has always said — is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,” he said.
The interview with TF1, a French television network, appeared sympathetic to the concerns of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.
Mr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.
During his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.
There was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron’s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.
David Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron’s proposal on Telegram.
He said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was “leave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.”
The last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span> Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine’s “independence and sovereignty in the existing borders” in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.
<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2019,</span> when he declared the need for the reinvention of “an architecture of security” between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new “stability order” in Europe.
Although he has condemned Mr. Putin’s “imperial” invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.
Responding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron’s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: “Devastating.”
Dr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer’s tweet, saying: “You know you’re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin’s state propaganda praises you. It seems that no matter how brutal Putin is, Macron can’t let go of his flawed vision.”
There is deep suspicion of Mr. Macron’s approach to Russia in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and other states in the European Union and NATO that were once under the Soviet totalitarian yoke. This has undermined his aspirations to European leadership.

Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:19 pm ET

An October surge in the U.S. dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets’ vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 10 trading</span> days, hitting a high last seen in the spring.</span> It has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 2.4% this</span> month. China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday, while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, Mexico declined against the dollar.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The dollar’s strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields, reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December, and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose by <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.02 percentage</span> point <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.778%,</span> its highest close since early June, while Nymex crude closed <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $50 for</span> a third consecutive day.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The increases in the dollar and U.S. bond yields so far have been modest, while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 15.54 points</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18144.20.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis, by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging markets.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Clearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed,’’ said Gemma Wright-Casparius, senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard Group.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">A stronger dollar is generally good for the U.S. economy, boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflation.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But a rising dollar also stands to hit U.S. corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It also threatens to hamstring policy makers’ efforts to generate modest inflation gains.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“This Fed is more market dependent than data dependent,’’ said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting, he said, “the Fed is very unlikely to raise rates.”

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates “relatively soon,” according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon, although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate move.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Federal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 70% probability</span> of a rate increase by the Fed’s meeting in December, according to data from CME Group.</span> The odds were <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 50% a</span> month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit vote.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Eurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the U.S. hit a two-year high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.255 trillion</span> for the week ended Oct.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> according to data from TD Securities.

Rising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear decline.

</span>The yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month, while the 10-year U.K. gilt yield <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 1% Wednesday</span>.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Some analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlook.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As a result, some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The so-called 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.65 percentage</span> point late Wednesday, a five-month high, according to Tradeweb.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The figure suggests investors expect annual U.S. inflation <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.65% in</span> the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 10 years</span>.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">To be sure, few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Fed’s favored inflation measure has been below the central bank’s targets for more than four years.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Skeptics point to continuing challenges, such as rising debt and slowing growth in China.

</span>The People’s Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.7258 on</span> Wednesday, marking <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.24% decline</span> in the yuan from Tuesday’s midpoint. Wednesday’s fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2010.</span>

The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken. Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan, and that the People’s Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan moves.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Eric Stein, co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management, said markets “seem far less sensitive” to the yuan’s weakness this time than they were in the market declines of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2015 and</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2016.</span>

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“I don’t think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks,’’ he said.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">”But if financial conditions broadly tighten, that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them” to emphasize they don’t expect long-term rates to rise sharply.

A tumultuous week for markets around the world ended with a rocky Friday session, putting the S&<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 on</span> the cusp of correction territory as investors continued an October retreat from risky assets.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">As stocks tumbled in early trading, the benchmark stock index fell <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3% to</span> breach the level that would place <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">it 10% below</span> last month’s record.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But as was the case for much of a whirlwind week marked by intraday dips and sharp rebounds, stocks stabilized—before slipping again in the final hour of trading.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Worries about corporate revenue peaking and a slowdown in China and Europe potentially spilling over into the U.S. economy have sent stocks into a tailspin.</span> Fast-growing internet firms have been some of the hardest hit during the turmoil, leading analysts to question whether companies that previously seemed immune to global growth fears can continue surging ahead.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Quarterly sales from Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet disappointed investors, sending the two stocks sharply lower Friday and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its worst week since March.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Once you start seeing a slowdown in revenue, it makes sense that those stocks could fall, but what’s been upsetting is you see everything coming down,” said Craig Hodges, portfolio manager for Hodges Funds.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I’m really amazed at some of the prices I see.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Hodges said he has been buying shares of materials stocks and home builders that have been engulfed by this week’s selling and are among the market’s worst performers this year.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">With Amazon’s drop, the e-commerce company’s market value fell to <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $800 billion</span>, putting it behind Microsoft as the second-largest U.S. company after Apple.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">After Amazon hit <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1 trillion</span> market cap in early September, some analysts had anticipated it would soon overtake Apple as the world’s largest publicly traded company.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But investors have said weaker-than-expected revenue has stoked fears about softening global demand.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 30,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 1</span>:37 pm ET

Mortgage rates dropped <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 4% for</span> the first time since early last year, adding to hopes for a revival in the housing market.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The average rate this week on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.99%,</span> mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Thursday.</span> That marks a fall of nearly a full percentage point from the highs of November. Some lenders have been offering rates well below that.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Lower rates stand to make mortgages more affordable for buyers, and the sharp fall so far <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 has</span> lifted optimism for a market that has cooled after years of torrid home price growth around the country.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Lower rates should “give a boost to the housing market, which has been on the upswing,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, citing home-sales data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The drop in mortgage rates tracks a decline in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which was recently at its lowest <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Yields have fallen amid concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for a protracted trade dispute with China.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economy has remained relatively strong during the first three months of the year.</span> It grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1%,</span> according to data released Thursday. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Still, concerns about an economic slowdown could weigh on the housing market, particularly after a mini boom earlier in the year.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Unlike earlier this year, there is no backlog of buyers waiting to enter the market, and a slowing economy is preventing homebuying sentiment from rising from 10-year lows,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Housing data have been mixed.</span> The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that the number of previously owned houses going into contract <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.5% from</span> the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the measure has been down <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 consecutive</span> months. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">But purchase applications have been trending higher, and new-home sales have mostly been climbing this year.

Millions of workers are doing their day jobs from makeshift set-ups in their living rooms and kitchens, while those in England who can't work from home are now encouraged to go back in if they can do so safely.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">But how exposed to coronavirus might you be in your job?</span> And how does that compare to others?
Data from the UK's Office for National Statistics, based on a US survey, puts into context the risk of exposure to disease, as well as the amount of close human contact workers had before social distancing and other safety measures were introduced.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">See how your job ranks by using the search below.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">While most jobs require people to work relatively closely to others - somewhere in the range between arm's length and a shared office environment - there are very few that typically involve exposure to disease more than once a year.
</span>It's important to note that the data on both exposure to disease at work and how close people are to others is based on interviews that took place with US workers before the pandemic broke out and social distancing recommendations were introduced.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some jobs may find it easier to adjust than others and there may be slightly different working practices and conditions in the US for certain occupations.</span> The results can be expected to be broadly the same in most developed countries.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Almost all the jobs that have a high exposure to both disease and other people are healthcare professions, while those who scored low on both measures include artists, lawyers and those in more typical office jobs like marketing, HR and financial advisers.
</span>Cleaners, prison officers and undertakers are among those who have relatively high exposure to disease without so much close interaction with other people.
But the people who might be most at risk to a new infectious disease like Covid-19, are those who have lots of close contact with people, but aren't used to being exposed to disease.
Bar staff, hairdressers and actors fall into this category, as well as taxi drivers and bricklayers.

Other figures released by the ONS this week showed that deaths in the healthcare sector in the UK are no higher on average than those in the wider community, although social care workers were dying at higher rates. Given that these healthcare occupations are so exposed to both disease and other people, why have there not been more deaths?
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">This could be because workers in these jobs are more likely to be using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves, says Ben Humberstone, deputy director for health analysis at the ONS.</span> They also follow regular hygiene measures like washing hands.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">One of the jobs which had many more coronavirus deaths than the average was taxi drivers.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That's a job which scores highly in terms of closeness to other people, particularly among those jobs which are still actually possible to do at the moment.</span> Bar staff, hairdressers and fitness instructors all score higher, but with bars, gyms and hair salons shut, most of these people will be isolating.
As taxi drivers are less exposed to disease in normal times, there may not be an existing culture of regular hand-washing and wearing PPE. Some firms are trialling partition screens and distributing gloves and masks to protect their drivers and customers.
Methodology
The data in the look-up comes from this release by the ONS.
The figures on proximity to others and exposure to disease come from a survey carried out by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) in which they asked respondents in the US to place themselves on a 1-5 scale for the following two questions.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job?
</span>2. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">How often does your current job require you to be exposed to diseases or infection?
</span>For exposure to disease, a score of one means they are never exposed, while a score of five means they are exposed daily. It's referring to any disease, not coronavirus specifically.
For the physical closeness question, one means the respondent works more than 100ft away from the nearest other person, while five means they need to touch or be near to touching other people at work. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The survey was carried out before social distancing measures were introduced and workers in certain jobs will of course find it easier to adjust than others.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The responses for people in the same jobs were averaged together and extrapolated to form a score <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">We've looked at these scores out of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100 and</span> given each job a ranking.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">If any two jobs had the same score we've given them a tied ranking.

Four Louisiana nursing home residents who were evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ida have died at facility where state inspectors were prevented from conducting a full assessment this week, state officials said on Thursday.
Three of the fatalities have been classified as storm-related by the coroner, though definitive causes of death have not yet been confirmed, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
The deaths occurred at a facility in Tangipahoa Parish, north of New Orleans. Inspectors “promptly visited the site but were expelled from the property,” state officials said in a written statement. “We have significant concerns about conditions in this facility.”
More <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800 residents</span> from seven different nursing homes had been moved to the Tangipahoa Parish facility, and state officials said they are working to find safe placements for them, beginning with the most vulnerable.
As of Thursday morning,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 721 had</span> been moved. A dozen of those required hospitalization.
“We will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement,” the State Department of Health said.
“It’s very disheartening,” said Robby Miller, the Tangipahoa Parish president.
Mr. Miller called the incident is a cautionary tale for others with family members in nursing homes in Louisiana: The conditions and quality of care at an evacuation facility may not be as good as in a typical nursing home.
Some of the nursing home residents have now been moved to a state facility run by Louisiana State University in Alexandria, Mr. Miller said.
The news came as officials in New Orleans announced on Thursday that they were organizing a voluntary evacuation option for residents hoping to get out of the city, which remains largely without electricity.
Details of that plan are still in the works, but it would allow residents to be taken to a state-run shelter outside the city, said Collin Arnold, the New Orleans director of homeland security.
The city would give priority to elderly and disabled residents and then make the option available to the general public, he said.
Across Louisiana, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 594,000 customers</span> remained without power on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the electric utility Entergy. By early afternoon,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,000 power</span> customers in New Orleans had their electricity restored, said Ramsey Green, the city’s deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Entergy hoped to restore full power to the French Quarter and central business district by late Thursday, he said.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 27 electric</span> substations in New Orleans, Mr. Green said,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 are</span> back online.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell, speaking at an afternoon briefing, noted that in addition to electricity, access to fuel continues to be a challenge for city residents. “We just have not received adequate fueling sources to the general public.” Ms. Cantrell promised that “when we get more we shall share more.”
The storm that ripped through southeastern Louisiana on Sunday left a still-untold number of people without homes and wreaked havoc on other essential services. Hundreds of thousands of people found themselves in places where water infrastructure was badly damaged by the storm and pumps and treatment plants were left without power.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, who is expected to visit the state on Friday, said the flash floods that inundated New York City and the powerful winds that knocked out power in Louisiana were a sign that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here” and that the storms and fires creating life-or-death situations across the country constituted “one of the great challenges of our time.”
“Hurricane Ida didn’t care if you were a Democrat or Republican, rural or urban,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, urging Congress to pass his economic agenda when it returned from its recess later this month, in order to provide critical investments in electrical infrastructure.</span> “This destruction is everywhere. And it’s a matter of life and death, and we’re all in this together.”
In the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.
In Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.
“This has become basic-level subsistence,” said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.
This was life, upended, in much of the region — an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.
At a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was “a broken community” that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.
“I had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,” she said. “It looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.”
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — There were several flare-ups during a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.
It was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.
“I feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what’s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,” said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.
She added, “I’m just worried sick.”
On Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.
Conditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.
“This is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it’s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire’s edge now,” he said.
Other firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.
Firefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.
After the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.
“The weather has been working in our favor,” said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. “Look at the Dixie fire.”
Firefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake’s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.
The blaze, which <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and “squirrelly winds” in the Kirkwood area.
But so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.

The Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.
More <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews — sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain — build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.
“It becomes ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing — Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.
By Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.
Southeast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties — the town of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.
“The fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,” said David Hammond,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.
Mr. Hammond’s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, “in case we’ve got to go.”
In other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire’s wrath in challenging terrain.
More <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.
Several towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.
“We would hope that we’re on the downhill slide,” Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. “But after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,” he added, “it’s just hard to venture a guess.”
PHILADELPHIA — As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87,</span> was in his <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.
By late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back. Still, it could be worse.
“I feel so bad for the people who lost property,” he said.
Those people were all over the region on Thursday, as residents of Mid-Atlantic States awoke to a trail of destruction left behind by remnants of Ida, which struck Louisiana as a hurricane days before. Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns — and were still rising.
Officials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.
Tens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.
“Al Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,” said Frank Feingold,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.
The Schuylkill had reached the “major” flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.
“We are still doing water rescues across the city; we’ve done that for the <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 15 hours</span> now continually,” Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. “We know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 100 years</span>,” he added. “And potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.”
The mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. “Extreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,” he said. “They are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.”
In Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L’angolo. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.
“It was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,” he said. “It came halfway up the windows.”
Some of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that “the size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,” with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.
“After last night’s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,” said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “Both waterways have already surpassed all-time records.”
In Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.
The Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">got 10 inches</span> of rain. “I don’t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,” Mr. DiGirolamo said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.
One of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.
</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.
“For me it was just like a flash,” said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. “We tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.”
When he came outside, he found his neighbor’s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink. It wasn’t his.

In the aftermath of a ferocious storm caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida that killed more than three dozen people in four states, national and local leaders acknowledged Thursday that extreme weather events posed an urgent and ongoing threat.
The storm killed at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 people</span> in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut and left more <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150,000 homes</span> without power. States of emergency remained in effect across the region by midday Thursday, as officials sought to get a handle on the damage.
Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm
More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 people</span> were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred.
Speaking from the White House, President Biden said the damage indicated that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” constituting what he called “one of the great challenges of our time.”
At a news conference in Queens on Thursday morning, Gov. Kathy C. Hochul of New York said she had received a call from Mr. Biden, who she said “offered any assistance” as the state assessed the damage from Ida, a storm that she said represented a new normal.
“We need to foresee these in advance, and be prepared,” she said.
The deluge of rain on Wednesday — more than half a foot fell in just a few hours — turned streets and subway platforms into rivers. Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 150 miles</span> per hour. Some rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were still rising.
Ida’s remnants brought historic hourly rainfall to New York and New Jersey.
Each bar represents one recorded hour of precipitation in Newark.
The rain broke records set <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 days</span> before by Tropical Storm Henri, underscoring warnings from climate scientists of a new normal on a warmed planet: Hotter air holds more water and allows storms to gather strength more quickly and grow ever larger.
Many of New York City’s subway lines remained suspended into the evening on Thursday. Airports were open but hundreds of flights had been canceled.
In New York City, the dead ranged in age from a 2-year-old boy to an 86-year-old woman, the police said. Some drowned in basement apartments in Queens, where a system of makeshift and mostly illegally converted living spaces has sprung up.
On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that at <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 23 people</span> in the state had died. They included four people found dead in an apartment complex in Elizabeth and two people were killed in Hillsborough, N.J. after they became trapped in their vehicles, a spokeswoman for the town said. Another death occurred in Passaic, N.J., where the Passaic River breached its banks and fish flopped in the streets.
Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced that the state would lower flags to half-staff to honor Brian Mohl, a state police sergeant whose car was swept away by the floodwaters.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 3.15 inches</span> of rain that fell in Central Park in one hour on Wednesday eclipsed the record-breaking one-hour rainfall <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.94 inches</span> on Aug.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span> The National Weather Service, struggling to depict the level of danger, declared a flash flood emergency in New York City for the first time.
In Bergen County, New Jersey’s most populous county, County Executive James Tedesco, a former firefighter, said on Thursday: “We have not complete devastation but close to it. This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.”

Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue, feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by Hurricane Ida and its aftermath. Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.
Before you give, do your research.
Natural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.
</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.
Donations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.
If you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.
Here are some local organizations in the storm area.
All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.
The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.
Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.
AirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.
SBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.
A number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana’s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.
Bayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.
Louisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.
National organizations are lending a hand.
AmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.
Mercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida’s wake and is accepting donations.
GoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.
Project HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.
The Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 90999.</span>
The Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.

Republicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene. A top House Democrat announced the chamber will vote Thursday to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments.
The House will vote on stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee roles as G.O.P. weighs her future.
The House will vote Thursday on whether to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, a top Democrat announced, forcing congressional Republicans to take a public stand on the Georgia freshman who endorsed conspiracy theories and calls to execute Democratic politicians before she was elected.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 Democrat</span>, said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, and that “it is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Representative Greene from her committee assignments.”
House Democrats, incensed by a series of social media posts made by Ms. Greene before she won her seat in November, threatened earlier this week that they would take the unusual step of moving unilaterally to remove Ms. Greene from the education and budget committees if Republicans themselves did not take action.</span> Party leaders generally have authority over who represents them on committees.
The vote will make Republicans go on the record for the first time on whether Ms. Greene should be rebuked for her past comments.
While most Republican lawmakers have privately been horrified by her rhetoric, some have argued that members of Congress should not face punishment for remarks they made before they were elected, and that allowing one party (in this case, Democrats) to take unilateral action against a lawmaker in another party would set a dangerous precedent. Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene’s side.
Mr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference’s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.
A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer’s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would “address this with members later today.”
Mr. Hoyer’s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber. They are also expected to discuss the turmoil around Ms. Greene.
Supporters of Mr. Trump want to strip Ms. Cheney of her leadership post as payback for her vote to impeach the former president. And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.
Ms. Greene’s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.
Ms. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to “rush an emergency donation” to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $160,000 in</span> one day.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Biden says he won’t drop his ‘promise’ <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1,400 stimulus</span> checks, but is open to further targeting them.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">President Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he would not agree to scale back <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,400 direct</span> payments to many Americans that are a centerpiece of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $1.9 trillion</span> stimulus package, but would consider restricting them to lower-income individuals as Republicans have proposed.
</span>“We can’t walk away from an <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $1,400 in</span> direct checks, because people need it,” Mr. Biden told the lawmakers on a private conference call, according to two people who participated. “I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to people.”
But he added: “We can better target the number — I’m OK with that.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden’s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president’s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.
</span>“We need to act fast,” Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. “It’s about who the hell we are as a country.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some Republicans have argued that the next round of stimulus checks should go to Americans most in need.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Biden’s plan, the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">full $1,400 payment</span> would be limited to individuals earning no more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75,000 a</span> year, but those with higher incomes would receive smaller checks.
</span>The president’s signal that he was open to compromise on the matter came a couple of days after he met at the White House <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 10 Republican</span> senators who are seeking <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $618 billion</span> package they said could win bipartisan backing. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their proposal calls for checks of up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,000 that</span> would go only to individuals earning less <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $50,000 a</span> year, with the full payment limited to those whose annual income <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $40,000 or</span> below.
</span>Later, Mr. Biden met separately at the White House with Senate Democrats and again discussed narrowing eligibility for the checks.
“We did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they’re targeted,” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">On the call with House Democrats, Mr. Biden said he was “not married to a particular, absolute number” on the overall stimulus package.
</span>“We can make compromises on several of the programs,” he told them, adding, “we have to take care of the people who are hurting.”
As for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call that that was “not in the cards.”

Senate Democrats will assume chairmanships of committees under a power-sharing deal with Republicans.
Senate Democrats will take control of the chamber’s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.
The lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden’s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.
“I’m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,” Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Senate’s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell’s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.
</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided. It will allow equal party representation on committees but in the cases of tie votes, legislation or nominees will still advance to the floor for consideration.
Though the Senate is split 50-50, Democrats are in control by virtue of the power of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. The formal organizing resolution is expected to be considered later Wednesday.
Brian Sicknick, the officer who died from the Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span>, is honored in a ceremony at the Capitol he helped protect.
In the same room that rioters stormed last month, lawmakers gathered in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday for a memorial service to honor Brian D. Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the Jan.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 attack</span>.
Mr. Sicknick is the fifth person to lie in honor in the Capitol, a distinction reserved for private citizens, while government officials, like former presidents, lie in state.
“Blessed are the peacekeepers like Brian,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said during the ceremony. “Let us be the peacekeepers now in his memory.”
Mr. Sicknick’s family, lawmakers and other top officials attended the ceremony, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who also spoke; the Republican leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California; Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington. Before the service, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also paid their respects.
Mr. Sicknick’s remains were delivered to the Capitol on Tuesday evening, passing through a set of doors still shattered from the events of Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Officers from his unit, some on mountain bikes, lined up near the steps outside.
Minutes later, President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, departed the White House to pay their respects.
“We must be vigilant, as what President Lincoln referred to as the harsh artillery of time, we will never forget,” Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday during the ceremony near a table where Mr. Sicknick’s remains and an American flag were placed. “Each day when members enter the Capitol, this temple of democracy, we will remember his sacrifice and then others that day who fought so hard to protect the Capitol and the Congress.”
Walking out of the rotunda after the service, Representatives Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, and Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, paid their final respects side by side.
At <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 14 other</span> Capitol Police officers were injured in the attack, according to a memo issued by the F.B.I. Two police officers who responded to the siege have since died by suicide.
“Knowing our personal tragedy and loss is shared by our nation brings hope for healing,” Mr. Sicknick’s partner, Sandra Garza, and his family said in a statement.
As he left the Capitol for the final time, Mr. Sicknick was met by rows of officers, saluting the hearse that drove his remains to Arlington National Cemetery.

The Justice Dept. drops a lawsuit accusing Yale of discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants.
The Justice Department on Wednesday withdrew a lawsuit against Yale that charged the university with discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants for admission, another reversal by the new administration of a Trump-era policy.
The Trump administration had made race-based college admissions a target, and today’s action suggests the Biden administration may be prepared to retreat from that policy.
Supporters of the Trump administration’s lawsuit assert that Asian-Americans and whites are being held to higher admissions standards at a number of elite colleges. <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> a federal judge rejected claims that Harvard had intentionally discriminated against Asian-American applicants, but the plaintiffs are expected to file a petition to the Supreme Court.
“Yale is gratified that the U.S. Justice Department has dropped its lawsuit challenging Yale College’s admissions practices,” Karen N. Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Our admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.”
The “notice of voluntary dismissal” of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department’s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.
In a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit “in light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,” including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard’s admissions practices.
But the department said that it would continue an “underlying investigation” to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.
The Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.
“It is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,” said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. “Using race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.”
The lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The government said that race was the “determinative factor” in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that “for the great majority of applicants,” Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.
Violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.
Yale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration’s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.
Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.
She and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump’s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
If Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for “incitement of insurrection.”
At home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It’s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere — beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.
At least one conservative state lawmaker — who described the impeachment vote as “an ice pick in the back” by Republicans who supported it — has printed “Impeach Liz Cheney!” yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.
People close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country’s electoral system.
As she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called “the big lie,” Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump’s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.
Her allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.
“The beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,” said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. “So the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it’s only helping Democrats.”
Some Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden’s immigration policies.
After a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden’s order to pause deportations <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president’s new tone.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.
“This is not what the Biden administration stands for,” Henry Hollithron, the man’s lawyer, said in an interview. “That is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.”
President Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a “deep state” inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws.
Mr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.
Videos celebrating Mr. Trump’s “big, beautiful” border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump’s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol’s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents — whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump — has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration’s reversals of his policies.
Those agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump’s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The day before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE’s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.
</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden’s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.

WASHINGTON — More <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators — in some cases their own bosses — to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent “attack on our workplace” that threatened the peaceful transition of power.
In a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who “smashed” their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his “baseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">“As congressional employees, we don’t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,” they wrote.</span> “And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.”
A copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate’s impeachment trial.
The letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump’s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the “incitement of insurrection” he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials’ behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views — much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.
The House <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.
The House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.
The provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.
“Given the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,” Ms. Pelosi said. “It is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span></span>”
The vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.
During a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.
“These words and actions raise serious safety concerns,” Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors “a basic safety measure.”
Ms. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines “unconstitutional.”

6638e8d7025a632c3463135c,83514,"<h3>Stand With Us!</h3>Plan draws on research suggesting very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive; tobacco companies say science isn’t conclusive

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 6</span>:59 pm ET

The Biden administration is moving forward on a plan to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a policy that would upend <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $95 billion</span> U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions of people to quit smoking.

The plan, unveiled Tuesday as part of the administration’s agenda of regulatory actions, likely wouldn’t take effect for several years. The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2023,</span> though the agency cautioned that date could change. Then the agency would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue, which could further delay the policy’s implementation.

“Nicotine is powerfully addictive,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement Tuesday. “Lowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit.”

The move would be the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998,</span> when tobacco companies agreed to pay more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 billion</span> to help states pay for healthcare. As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to various marketing restrictions, including a ban on free product samples and advertising on billboards.

The cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 when</span> the pandemic hit. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 12.5% of</span> adults in the U.S., <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 30.8 million</span> people, were cigarette smokers <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. cigarette sales are expected to drop this year to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $95 billion</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $99 billion</span> last year, according to Euromonitor International.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The policy would apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S. Imports of traditional cigarettes would be barred but multinational tobacco companies could continue to sell full-nicotine cigarettes in other countries.</span> New Zealand’s Ministry of Health also has proposed a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes to very low levels as part of a broader plan to curb smoking.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The FDA’s planned rule could sharply decrease U.S. cigarette sales, and tobacco companies intend to fight it.</span> The largest U.S. cigarette makers—Altria Group Inc. <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MO 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle and Reynolds American Inc.—sell alternative products such as nicotine pouches, but revenue for both companies comes predominantly from cigarettes.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Altria shares at market close Tuesday had fallen <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 7% since</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10,</span> when The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration planned to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes.

</span>Reynolds and Altria said Tuesday that encouraging smokers to switch to less harmful options was a better approach to improving public health than reducing nicotine in cigarettes.

“We do actually support the overarching goal here, which is to transition smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free products,” said Murray Garnick, Altria’s general counsel. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We just think that the better way is to create a robust market of FDA-authorized smoke-free products.”

Mr. Garnick said that the policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels wasn’t achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year.</span> If the policy were effective, he said, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.

Nicotine is the addictive chemical that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn’t cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.

The FDA’s nicotine-reduction plan is based on more than a decade of government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Smokers of these cigarettes were more likely to quit or seek their nicotine fix from less-harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes or gum compared with smokers who continued using regular cigarettes.

Cigarette smoking is the most dangerous way to consume nicotine, according to public health officials. While very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive, researchers say, their smoke still contains most of the same carcinogenic compounds as regular cigarette smoke.

According to an FDA study published <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> such a rule would prompt an <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 13 million</span> adult smokers to quit within five years of implementation.

Smoking is linked to more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 480,000 deaths</span> in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And tobacco use costs <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $300 billion</span> a year in direct healthcare and lost productivity, the FDA says.

</span>Cigarette industry executives say the science on low-nicotine cigarettes isn’t conclusive. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">They say that such a rule would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and could lead to consumer confusion around the health risks of very low-nicotine cigarettes.</span> There is widespread misunderstanding in the U.S. about the health risks of nicotine. An FDA study <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 found</span> that <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75% of</span> people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine caused cancer.

Big cigarette companies also say it would take years for them to develop a very low-nicotine cigarette and that it wouldn’t be feasible to manufacture at scale. In the past, tobacco companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. In anticipation of a federal nicotine-reduction rule, Altria and Reynolds have experimented with other ways, including tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.

22nd Century Group Inc., <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">XXII 3.33</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical tobacco plant for a cigarette brand called VLN. The product is currently available for sale in Chicago. Through a federal contract, 22nd Century has also supplied more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 million</span> cigarettes at varying nicotine levels for scientific research.

22nd Century is willing to partner with other cigarette companies to provide tobacco seeds, Chief Executive James Mish said. “It’s immediately scalable,” he said.

Lowering nicotine in cigarettes has been a subject of discussion inside the FDA since the 1990s. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the agency the authority to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes, but only if the policy was based on scientific evidence, a caveat that slowed the process for years. The law stipulated that the FDA couldn’t eliminate nicotine in cigarettes entirely.

Scott Gottlieb, who served as an FDA commissioner during the Trump administration, pursued a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes as part of a broader tobacco policy he proposed <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> But after he left the agency <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> Trump administration officials shelved the plan.

The Biden administration decided to embrace the policy as part of President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative, which aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 50% over</span> the <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 25 years</span>. His administration is also pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which account for more than a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The FDA published a proposed rule on menthols in April and is now soliciting public comments. That ban also likely wouldn’t take effect for several years.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Separately, the FDA is conducting a review of all e-cigarettes on the market and weighing whether their potential benefit as a less-harmful alternative for adult cigarette smokers outweighs the products’ risk to young people.

Health officials are learning more about the deadly pathogen behind the continuing pandemic
Scientists and public-health officials are learning more about the new coronavirus behind a continuing pandemic. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.
What are the symptoms of Covid-19?
The virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.
The Latest on the Coronavirus
- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 114,000
</span>- U.S. cases <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">passes 22,000
</span>- What we know about the coronavirus
Some people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don’t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:
• Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath
• Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
• Bluish lips or face
What should I do if I develop symptoms?
If you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.
Isolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.
How worried should I be?
Most people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But “mild” can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you’ll have to be isolated or quarantined.
By not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.
<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.
Public-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn’t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren’t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.
I’m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?
The new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.
Is taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?
Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn’t a cure and won’t prevent you from infecting others.
I’ve heard I shouldn’t take ibuprofen. Is that true?
There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn’t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn’t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.
Is there a test?
Yes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.
Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.
What if I have to self-isolate?
If you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.’s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don’t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.
Don’t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.
Are there drugs to treat coronaviruses?
There aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.’s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.
Two clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.
How do I keep from getting Covid-19?
Schools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending—and in some cases, requiring—that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.
Who is most at risk?
Adults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8% in</span> people <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 70 to</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 79,</span> compared with <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.
Are my children at risk?
Few children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 and</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.
How at risk is someone in the U.S.?
Covid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.
The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.
Public-health officials hope to “flatten the curve” of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That’s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.

How is the virus spread among humans?
It transmits through “respiratory droplets” when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, according to the WHO. The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person’s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.
Respiratory droplets are heavy and don’t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.
Scientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.
How long can the virus survive on surfaces?
It can last up <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.
The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.
Wipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.
Can face masks protect you?
Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings—even a bandanna or scarf will do—in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.
Cloth masks or coverings don’t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren’t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn’t be used on children <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.
What else can I do to protect myself?
The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth—viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.
Is it safe to travel internationally?
The State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.
Can I donate blood?
The CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. “Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,” said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.
To minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.
Going back to basics: What is a coronavirus?
This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.
Seven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
This new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)
How deadly is it?
The overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span> <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won’t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.
The mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.
The overall mortality rate may be less <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.
That is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.1%.</span>
Covid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen—SARS, which erupted in China <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.
But this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.
How Effective Are Masks?
The World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.

Frequently changing disposable masks, and washing your hands after, are important steps to avoid contamination from pathogens that cling to the outer surface.
N95 masks offer more protection. But they only work if they fit properly, and aren’t suitable for children or people with facial hair.
Surgical masks don’t offer full protection against airborne viruses. They don’t fully seal off the nose and mouth.

Frequently changing disposable masks, and washing your hands after, are important steps to avoid contamination from pathogens that cling to the outer surface.
N95 masks offer more protection. But they only work if they fit properly, and aren’t suitable for children or people with facial hair.

How easily does the virus spread?
Disease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.5 and</span><span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 to</span><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 other</span> people.
Public-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
Experts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.
What is the incubation period?
People become ill between two <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 11.5 days</span>.
Can you get infected after you have already had the disease?
That isn’t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.
Can you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?
Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance—6 feet or more—from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.
Where did the new coronavirus come from?
The new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.

Is the virus mutating, particularly in a way that would make it more contagious?
While the virus has made some genetic changes—as RNA viruses are prone to do—none have made it deadlier or more contagious, according to experts.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Could imported goods carry the virus?
</span>That is unlikely, the CDC says. Coronaviruses generally don’t survive that long on inanimate surfaces, according to the agency.

By Natalie Sherman
Business reporter, New York
- Published
The US central bank has pushed interest rates to the highest level in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 15 years</span> as it fights to rein in soaring prices in the world's largest economy.
</span>The Federal Reserve announced it was raising its key rate by <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 0.75 percentage</span> points, lifting the target range <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.25%.</span>
Borrowing costs are expected to climb more - and remain high, the bank said.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The move comes despite mounting concern that the cost of controlling inflation could be a harsh economic downturn.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the rate rises were necessary to slow demand, easing the pressures putting up prices and avoiding long-term damage to the economy.</span> But he conceded that they will take a toll.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">""We have got to get inflation behind us,"" he said.</span> ""I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""
Banks in nearly every country - with the big exceptions of Japan and China - are facing similar trade-offs as they raise rates to combat their own inflation problems.
</span>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce its seventh consecutive rate rise at its meeting on Thursday, while Indonesia and the Philippines are among the other countries also poised for increases.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Analysts are starting to worry that the global sweep of the rate hikes, which ripple out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, loans and credit card debt, could lead to greater economic slowdown than policymakers expect.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Even if it avoids the two quarters of contraction that typically define a recession, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2023 world</span> economy is expected to be at its weakest in more than a decade, excepting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 pandemic</span> year, said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">""What has become clear is that if given the choice between allowing inflation to remain high for a sustained period .... or pushing the economy into a recession, [central bank leaders] would rather push the economy into recession and get inflation back towards target,"" he said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">How much will interest rates go up?
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the US, the Fed is raising rates at one of the fastest paces in its modern history, a sharp reversal after years of low borrowing costs, responding to inflation that is running at a 40-year high.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed initially hoped that the problems would fade as supply chain issues tied to the coronavirus pandemic abated.</span> But the war in Ukraine, which disrupted oil and good supplies, added to the problem.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while oil prices have since come down, inflation pressures are now bubbling across the economy, with the most recent data showing inflation <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3% in</span> August, with big increases in housing, health care and education costs.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Wages, while rising, have not kept pace, hurting household budgets.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Wednesday's rate increase - the fifth in a row - lifts the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow from near zero at the start of the year <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% for</span> the first time since <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect it to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 4.4% by</span> the end of the year - and rise further <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023,</span> sharply higher than its prior forecasts.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">""What is striking is the speed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.</span> ""They're having to move very quickly ... and it means it's more likely to be a surprise to firms and households.<span id=""16"" class=""red"">""
Uncertainty weighs heavily
New Yorker Sean V said he felt lucky that he bought a two-bedroom condo last year, before borrowing costs started their climb, locking in a mortgage rate <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2.6%.</span>
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">But the 30-year-old works in the home loan industry, which has seen business plunge as mortgage rates <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cross 6% for</span> the first time <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">He said he feared losing his job ""every single day"" and was cutting back spending and scrapping holiday plans amid the uncertainty.
</span>""I don't know <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what 2023 is</span> going to bring,"" he said. ""All of that weighs heavily - not just on me, on everybody.<span id=""19"" class=""red"">""
""I don't know how stalling the economy is helping anyone.</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">""
How do higher interest rates reduce inflation?
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Some inflation is seen as healthy, but sudden, sharp price spikes make it hard for households and businesses to plan and reduce spending power, hurting economic growth and eroding living standards over time.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">By raising borrowing costs for businesses and households, central banks intend to reduce demand for big-ticket items like cars, homes or business expansions, which should ease the pressures pushing up prices.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But it also means less economic activity, which typically leads to job losses and other economic pain.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">In the US, where the economy contracted in the first half of the year, home sales have slumped and growing numbers of firms have instituted job cuts or hiring freezes, warning of rising costs and slowdown ahead.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">For now, the US jobs market has shown few signs of slowdown, helping to keep consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - resilient.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But pressure has been rising on the Fed.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, prominent progressive senator, Elizabeth Warren, called the Fed's moves ""extreme"".
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I've been warning that Chair Powell's Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work - and I fear he's already on the path to doing so,"" she wrote on Twitter.
</span>Will rate rises lead to a recession?
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Forecasts released by the Fed show policymakers expect growth in the US to slow to a crawl this year, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.2%.</span></span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">They see growth picking up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.2% next</span> year, but predict the unemployment rate will rise <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.4%.</span>
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The forecasts do not show inflation returning to the bank'<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2025.</span>
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr Powell said doing less could lead to even more economic damage.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">""Higher interest rates, slower growth and a softening labour market are all painful for the public that we serve but they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and and do it down the road again,"" he said.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Many analysts are forecasting a recession in the US next year but remain hopeful it will be relatively mild, noting that household finances are in better shape than in prior downturns.
</span>But the war in Ukraine and concerns about energy supplies raise the risks, JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon warned lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.
""There's a chance - not a big chance - a small chance, of a soft landing, there is a chance of a mild recession, a chance of a harder recession. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">And because of the war in Ukraine... and the uncertainty that causes in the global energy supply and food supply, there's a chance could be worse,"" he said.</span> ""I think policymakers should be prepared for the worst.""",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Stresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn’t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“That time is now upon us,” Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell didn’t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Reserves dropped to less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates—and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2008 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.

</span>“This is not QE,” Mr. Powell said. “In no sense is this QE.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed’s plan hasn’t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials’</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the “repo” market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16 and</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">With more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions—if allowed to fester—could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September’s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Market analysts said Mr. Powell’s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed’s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“This was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,” said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Fed’s next policy meeting is several weeks away “and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,” Mr. Powell said.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Despite the Fed’s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.

</span>“It’s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn’t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,” he said.

6638e8d7025a632c3463135c,87390,"<h3>Fixed mortgage rates are back down to February lows after sharp decline in bond yields and removal of unpopular refinance fee</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 80 lenders</span> nationwide to come up with weekly national averages.</span> It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with high credit scores and large down payments. Because of the criteria, these rates are not available to every borrower.
The survey is based on home purchase mortgages. Rates for refinances may be different.
The 15-year fixed-rate average decreased <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.12 percent</span> with an <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 0.7 point</span>. It <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 2.22 percent</span> a week ago <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.54 percent</span> a year ago. The five-year adjustable-rate average rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.49 percent</span> with an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 0.4 point</span>. It <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 2.47 percent</span> a week ago <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 3.09 percent</span> a year ago.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Mortgage rates fell sharply this week to their lowest level in months,” said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist.</span> “Less than a year after initially announcing it, the organization that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said last week that they would remove a policy that places an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 50 basis</span> point fee on mortgages that are being refinanced,” he added. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The program was intended to protect mortgage lenders from pandemic-driven losses, but it ultimately made it more expensive for homeowners to refinance their home loan and artificially increased the average mortgage rate.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rates immediately fell sharply on the announcement, a move that was extended later in the week as mounting concerns about the delta variant of covid-19 and its potential impact on expected economic growth led many investors to sell off stocks and seek the safe haven of bonds.”
</span>Borrowers wanting to refinance their mortgages received good news late last week. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that it was doing away with the adverse market refinance fee as of Aug.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span> The unpopular surcharge on refinances was announced last summer but not put in place until December. It was intended to offset covid-related losses suffered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The adjustment, which applied only to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinances, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.5 percent</span> of the loan amount. That added <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,500 to</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $300,000 loan</span>. According to FHFA data,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72 percent</span> of refinances were acquired by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2018 through</span> the first half <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“With less <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> of GSE loans in forbearance and continued home price appreciation resulting in significant borrower equity, there is no need for the fee,” said Bob Broeksmit, president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, suggested that borrowers would be wise to call several lenders before refinancing.
</span>“Lenders may use this as an opportunity to pad their own margins that have been squeezed by low rates and heated competition, so it is important for homeowners to seek out the lenders offering the best terms,” he said.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Monday’s dramatic stock market sell-off had investors fleeing to the safety of bonds, pushing prices up and yields down.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which started the month at<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>48 percent, plummeted to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>19 percent on Monday.</span> It rebounded to<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>3 percent on Wednesday, back nearly to where it was on Friday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“A declining stock market, foreign demand for U.S. debt and the need for portfolio rebalancing by institutional players have all come together to bid up the price of 10-year Treasurys,” said Ken H. Johnson, a real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“This increased demand has pushed down 10-year yields significantly to levels that no one anticipated.”
Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that more than two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to go down in the coming week.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“Interest rates should ease lower with the lifting late last week of the adverse market fee and the drop in the 10-year Treasury after the Fed once again reinforced inflation as transitory,” said Gordon Miller, owner of Miller Lending Group.</span> “New concerns about the covid variant globally have also raised concerns of continued growth being slower than expected, so a return to the lows for the year [is] quite possible in the weeks ahead.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, mortgage applications slumped last week.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">decreased 4 percent</span> from a week earlier.</span> The refinance index <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3 percent</span>, while the purchase index <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 6 percent</span>. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 64.9 percent</span> of applications.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“On a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the July 4th holiday week, mortgage applications were lower across the board, with purchase applications back to near their lowest levels since <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2020,</span>” Joel Kan, an MBA economist, said in a statement.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Limited inventory and higher prices are keeping some prospective home buyers out of the market.</span> Refinance activity fell over the week, but because rates have stayed relatively low, the pace of applications was close to its highest level since early May.”

WeWorking Class America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful and Miserable The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers’ Rights</span> Why Aren’t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?
What happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents’ home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big — it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job — any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald’s, if it came to that.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon’s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.
Given a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? “It seemed kind of rude,” Hirasuna said. “Like, ‘Hey, here I am!’ ” A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. “It was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,” he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity — to do work he might actually like — in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.
Offices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.
And then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision — hover outside the boss’s office? don’t hover? — poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“When it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,” said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> “It’s moving in the dark without a flashlight.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show “Survivor.”</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as “autistic.” Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as “on the spectrum” or as “a person with autism.” “Just don’t call me late for dinner,” said one who did not have a preference.)
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues’ needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.
</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, “essentially to see if I can break it,” as Hirasuna put it.
<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children’s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, “that they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon’s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist’s start-up.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon’s marketing material names “pattern recognition” and “uncompromised honesty” as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations — even stereotypes — in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon’s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. “I realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don’t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,” he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? “ ‘That’s autism!’ ” Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. “ ‘O.K. — that’s what we expected!’ ”
One morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon’s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. “Oh, it drives my husband crazy, too,” she assured him. “But it helps me concentrate.” <span id=""20"" class=""red"">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)
</span>Musayaf’s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. “O.K.,” he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.
Later, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. “I knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,” she wrote. “We understand and respect each other.”
Musayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague’s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.
Musayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla’s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. “Look,” he said, “there is no correct way, or incorrect.” He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.
A culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam’s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.
</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But before she was put in charge of Auticon’s United States business in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2018,</span> she hadn’t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.
That Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening — they had been told to clear their desks — but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.
Another co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark’s founder), who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair would later prove popular — some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them — but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man’s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam’s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it’s pizza).
“People with my type of disorder, it’s not that we don’t have emotion,” Gadson said. “It’s that we have too much emotion. We can’t push that stuff back.”
Beam, as she started to understand the office’s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees’ boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems — a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum — call in to explain, in great detail, why they won’t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“You know, some employers would say to someone like that, ‘I’m done,’ ”</span> Beam said. “But I’m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.”
Beam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> “It was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious — I could see it — that he wasn’t able to process what it was he was being told,” she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">“I kind of like it here,” Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn’t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: “They accept me as I am.”
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.
</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. “Horus,” said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: “Halberd.” <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett’s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.
</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party — once. “It felt really claustrophobic,” he said. “I was like, O.K., I think I’ve had enough.” He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work — fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world’s worst meeting — interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.
The next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague — the one who had bristled in the meeting — that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: “I prefer this number:<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.87298334621.</span>” The note made her laugh, even though she wasn’t sure what it meant. “It’s the square root <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15,</span>” he told her. She burst out laughing again.
The conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. ”Don’t they look miserable?” Beam said. Kayla was indignant. “You know that at least some of them are introverts,” she said. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">It was almost as if they didn’t think their employees had feelings.

There was a time, not all that long ago, when the NFL seemed on the verge of expanding its playoff field <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 12 to</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14 teams</span>.
Then it didn’t happen. Not then. Not now.
Or at least not yet.
So what’s the deal? Will it ever happen?
That’s a very definite maybe.
In <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2014,</span> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the expanded playoffs to take effect in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>.
“I do believe it will be approved for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>[season],” Goodell said then.
[From May 2014: Roger Goodell expects the NFL to expand its playoffs beginning in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>]
He also said at that point: “I think we want to see one more year of, ‘Will it impact the regular season in a positive way from a competitive standpoint? Will it create more excitement, more races towards the end about who’s going to qualify for the playoffs?’ And we also want to absorb the additional inventory into the marketplace from an advertising standpoint. We’ll be able to do that. … So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that’s how we’re going to approach it.”
But then it didn’t happen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest.</span> And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.
[From February 2015: Support erodes for expanded NFL playoffs]
That doesn’t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It’s been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league’s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 CBA</span>.</span> The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players’ approval.
But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.
Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.
But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allowing 44 percent</span> of the league into the postseason rather than the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 38 percent</span>. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.
Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn’t mean that.
At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">either 17 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 games</span>, could be reconsidered, although the players’ approval remains the obvious obstacle there. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the expanded postseason could be reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The current labor deal runs <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2020,</span> and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.
… AND TEN<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span></span> Seahawks say no to Kaepernick … The Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They’d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.

A Flying Elephant, a Teacher’s Hugs:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience
The virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.
As much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience — of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.
BRAZIL
“I am yearning for your hug. . .”
. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.
They had <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.
Students with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.
But the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.
Ms. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.
Her first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves — but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.
Then she came up with the idea of a pandemic “hugging kit” — disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.
The response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?
She rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.
“Distance can’t destroy what we have built,” Ms. Silva,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. “I needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I’m not able to hold them every morning.”
The kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon’s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.
Yasmim Vitória de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.
“She’s playful and she lets us have fun,” the 9-year-old said.
Ms. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.
“In a moment of tragedy, we’ve been able to share moments of love,” Ms. Silva said. “That is very powerful — Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni
INDIA
When India’s lockdown hit . . .
. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.
For years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India’s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.
When all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.
So Mr. Sahu,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn’t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.
“My mental condition was one of a mad person,” Mr. Sahu said. “When I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, ‘We have not eaten in days.’ It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.”
A spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.
When asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.
“Who else would take care of them?” he said. — Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj
ITALY
When an Italian bookstore appealed . . .
. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.
“We wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,” said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.
The idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers — and with luck a few volunteers — would read to people for <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. “We were thinking small,” she said.
But the response was overwhelming.
After the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.
Ms. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.
Ms. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she’d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.
In France, Paméla Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. “We managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,” Ms. Boittiaux said.
Ms. Romanese’s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.
“In a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,” she said. — Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden
BELARUS
When I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .
. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.
How he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country’s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk’s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.
</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. “All in all, I’m healthy and I’m free, which by today’s standards is quite something,” he said.
The doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.
Their authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.
But even as the president wouldn’t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing — a “people’s quarantine,” some called it.
One tech company, on Dr. Vitushka’s advice, bought <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.
After the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.
“All these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,” Dr. Vitushka told me. “And here we all came together in the face of a threat.”
For now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year’s pain — both for him and for his country — has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.
“We’re living through an intense coming-of-age period,” he said. “If I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.” — Anton Troianovski
CHINA
He has fostered more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .
. . . <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua’s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.
On Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.
Earlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week’s worth of food and water for their cats at home.
Please, they begged, could he help?
It was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city’s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.
But Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or “Old Cat,” did not hesitate.
“I just knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything,” he recalled. “It’s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.”
Almost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.
He wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.
<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats — and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.
“It was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,” Mr. Shuai said. “Looking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.”

Iran
The teacher had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .
. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.
For good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">children<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.
Some of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.
But Mr. Asadi,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> has <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.
“They told me, ‘You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher’s salary,’” Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. “But for me seeing the sweet smile on the children’s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.”
Overnight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.
He has also inspired others to act.
State-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.
</span>“Creating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,” Mr. Asadi said. — Farnaz Fassihi
BOLIVIA
The women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .
. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.
For months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women’s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn’t have to. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.
</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.
Sometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.
The death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.
“I wasn’t afraid to die,” she said. “Dying for me is a blessing, because I’m on the Lord’s path.” — Julie Turkewitz
CAMBODIA
When an elephant has to travel by plane. . .
. . . a lot of preparation is required.
It is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don’t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.
Now try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.
But on Nov.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.
Sent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.
Elephants are social creatures, and Kavaan’s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.
The trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.
Days before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.
Luckily, Kavaan’s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.
“2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,” said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, “and releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.” — Hannah Beech
KENYA
The calls and messages just kept coming . . .
. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi’s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food — or much of anything, really.
For many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.
Since it began, the project has raised more <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.
Ms. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.
“It changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,” Ms. Jaffar,<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. “There was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.”
But some parts of the story have been slower to change.
In April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.
“They didn’t stop until I said we were actually giving out food — ‘I am a community worker,’” she recalled.
Ms. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.
“We learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,” she said. — Abdi Latif Dahir
CHINA
She moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .
. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.
In late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.
Thousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hands 20 to</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.
Then, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor’s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor’s door.
That gave Ms. Guo an idea.
With friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.
She named her fledgling campaign “little vaccines against domestic violence,” and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.
Within hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag “little vaccines against domestic violence” has been viewed more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.
People across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.
The outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.
“Many people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,” Ms. Guo said, “but also because we’re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.”
Wuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.
</span>“It’s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,” she said. “So the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?” — Vivian Wang
<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MEXICO
2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .
. . . for Lucía Riojas Martínez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.
An outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.
But then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. “Remember what you have to do tomorrow,” she told herself.
At the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.
But lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country’s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.
And so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.
Ms. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn’t enough, that there was a “mental and emotional health crisis in the community,” she said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.
“More than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,” Ms. Riojas said.
Run largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
“Every day we know that the road gets harder, but we can’t take a step backward,” she said. “It’s forward — and it’s together.” — Oscar Lopez
BRITAIN
At <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .
. . . but now comes the reward.
In recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.
Then, the coronavirus came to Britain.
With older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard’s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.
For a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.
“It is frustrating because I live alone,” he said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“And you get fed up with your own company.”
</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.
Then, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.
“I was most surprised,” he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">day 1 of</span> Britain’s mass inoculation program. “I’ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.”
Mr. Pollard’s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. “Honestly, he’s my hero, nobody believes he’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 90,</span>” she said. “He’s just genuinely so kindhearted.”
Now, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy — to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family
“The worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,” Mr. Pollard said.
Now, at least for him, it has. — Megan Specia

WASHINGTON—The government accuses the company’s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film “Casablanca.” The company likens the government’s case to a shaved Persian cat, “pale and thin.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.
It could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as

Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.
</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren’t head-to-head competitors. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They want to combine AT&T’s video-distribution network with Time Warner’s content—from HBO’s “Game of Thrones” to the NCAA basketball tournament—in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.
</span>“This will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,” said Wayne State University law professor
Stephen Calkins,
“and what the court says will be terribly important.”

The case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss
Randall Stephenson
and U.S. antitrust chief
Makan Delrahim.
Mr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.
Mr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal—the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,
Amazon.com Inc.,
Hulu and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube. Younger customers increasingly watch video on phones, tablets and laptops.
The upheaval has left the pay-TV industry scrambling. Mr. Stephenson made <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $49 billion</span> play for video distribution by acquiring DirecTV, the top U.S. pay-TV satellite service, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> He’s now trying to make the company’s wireless and video bundles more attractive to viewers and investors by adding Time Warner news, sports and entertainment assets to the package.
Given Mr. Delrahim’s objections, the deal has been pending <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 17 months</span>, creating something of an industry chessboard frozen in time, with competitors uncertain of their next play. Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.’s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with
Walt Disney Co.
instead. (Journal parent company News Corp and
21st Century Fox
share common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as
Comcast
and
Verizon Communications Inc.
and clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.

Question of competition
The case raises this central question: If AT&T buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.
Mr. Delrahim’s team says yes. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and “American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.”
</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren’t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner’s content, especially the Turner networks—including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV—are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner’s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.

On the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn’t be so willing under AT&T. “With the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,” it says in filings.
AT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast’s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of “behavioral” conditions.
AT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone’s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. “AT&T and Time Warner aren’t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,” the companies say.
AT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn’t remedy the merger’s harms to competition.
Where Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T’s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers’ interests and preferences.

</span>Bad blood
High-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.
Mr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim’s motives and cited a television interview <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn’t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.
The two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President
Donald Trump,
as a carrot to win Justice Department approval.
Mr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.
The Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson’s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film “Casablanca,” quoting his famous line, “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”
People close to AT&T’s management say the department’s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable statements.
AT&T, in its own brief, said the department’s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: “Now, what remains of the government’s case, ‘like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,’ ” borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 case</span>.
That choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 19.</span> This isn’t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger’s fate.
The Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.
AT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO
Jeff Bewkes,
about what they see as the deal’s benefits.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor
Carl Shapiro,
who served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>.
</span>Judge Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, is expected to rule in the next few months. The companies extended their merger agreement from <span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 22 to</span> <span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 21 to</span> give him more time.
Mr. Trump’s comments hang over the case. After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn’t comment on the litigation, then added: “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.”

There is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump’s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the “elephant in the room” when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.
Mr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn’t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump’s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T’s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn’t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.
Judge Leon’s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.
The AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company—and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $4 billion</span>.
</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department’s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump’s comments about the deal.
The Justice Department has been riding a decade’s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.
Mr. Delrahim’s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.",,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,

Want more stories about how health-care policy affects you? Read Paige Winfield Cunningham.
Americans are flocking to Healthcare.gov in greater numbers than ever before in a development that runs precisely contrary to the doom-and-gloom everyone had predicted for this enrollment season.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">I think it’s safe to say that last year, the Obama administration would have pretty much killed for the shockingly brisk pace of Obamacare signups in the first four days the federal health insurance website opened for business.
</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced yesterday that more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600,000 people</span> selected plans from Nov.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 through</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.</span> Those figures appear quite a bit higher than last year, when just over a million people selected plans in the first dozen days (the best comparison available at this point). More than one in five of those people —<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 137,322 </span>— were new enrollees.
That’s despite the Trump administration’s much cooler attitude toward Healthcare.gov and Obamacare more generally. It seems certain the administration was trying to undercut enrollment figures by halting TV and radio advertising for the open enrollment season, chopping off navigator fund for groups that help people sign up and doing only the bare minimum to let people know they can start shopping.

In the face of suppressed outreach from Trump...
I should emphasize that it’s still just the very beginning of the six-week signup period -- and way too early to know how this year will turn out in comparison to years past. But the initial trajectory is one that virtually no one predicted.
Let’s explore a few reasons why this might be:<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> More Americans can get more generous subsidies this year.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">This is a phenomenon stemming from Trump’s decision to cut off extra payments to insurers for cost-sharing reductions they must offer.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">We elaborated on this effect in Monday’s The <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202,</span></span> but here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: To make up for losing the payments, many insurers hiked prices for their mid-grade “silver plans.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And because premium subsidies are based on silver plan prices, the subsidies are going up too, making bronze and gold plans even cheaper for many low-income people.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I really believe the availability of these very low-cost plans could be a game changer,” said Josh Peck, who served as Healthcare.gov’s chief marketing officer under Obama and now heads up the group Get America Covered.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Enrollees eligible for subsidies will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $555 on</span> average to offset the cost of their plans, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 45 percent</span> from this year’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $382 average</span> tax credit, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
</span>Point 2: It would be even <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">better 4 ppl</span> of all incomes & geos if Trump hadn't created uncertainty, repressed competition/enrollment, etc. 7/— Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>2</span>. People with a Healthcare.gov account are still getting reminder emails.
I know this because I created an account several years ago. I’ve received at least four reminder emails in the last week, telling me I should visit the website to search for a plan. So have others:
NYT's Margot Sanger-Katz:
https://t.co/FKjaESoJ24 is sending signup reminders, with details on the open enrollment period. I just got this one. pic.twitter.com/gIGSS2R9U5— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017
</span>Over</span> the last four years, the Obama administration created a large database of email addresses for past and current enrollees. Even though it appears the Trump administration isn’t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past – like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around – email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span> Maybe brokers are kicking butt.
Before the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they’d helped enroll an <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 40 to</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50 percent</span> of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 43 percent</span> of new enrollments on the state’s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment.
The Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration’s refusal to promote the law.
EHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 states</span>, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage.
“Web-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,” the company’s CEO Scott Flanders told me. “So it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.”<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it.
If the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won’t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that’s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn’t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said.
“Outreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,” Peck said.

AHH: There’s an expensive big fight brewing between two powerful lobbies -- hospitals and drug makers -- around an obscure drug discount program called 340B, Politico's David Pittman reports. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The program is supposed to help rural and charity hospitals by offsetting the cost of medicines for these low-income providers with discounted drugs.</span> But 340B has grown exponentially, now <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprising $16 billion</span> worth of medications dispensed in hospitals every year.
""Drug companies have gone on offense,"" David writes. ""In paid advertising, messaging through an army of lobbyists and on-the-record briefing of reporters, the pharmaceutical industry has crafted a message that hospitals are taking <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $6 billion</span> in drug discounts and using it to enrich themselves rather than help poor patients. They say the 340B cash has even played a role in hospitals buying up doctors’ offices, causing a rise in health care costs that more than cancels out any benefit of the drug discounts.""
“It seems to be a perversion of this program that patients might be paying more today than they would have prior,” Lori Reilly, PhRMA executive vice president, told reporters recently. “The goal of 340B was to lower costs to patients, not increase them.”
""Hospitals deny that characterization,"" David continues. ""But it’s caught the attention of at least some on the Hill. Congressional offices are drafting bills that would more tightly limit how hospitals use the discounts...The lobbying has escalated fast. <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 160 organizations</span>, almost all drug companies, hospitals and community health centers, reported lobbying on 340B last quarter, spending a <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined $41.8 million</span>, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms.""
OOF: A provision in the annual defense authorization bill has sparked a fiery debate over whether the Pentagon should be allowed to authorize the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices for combat soldiers, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
Under existing law, the FDA is the only agency that can authorize the use of medical products -- but the Defense Department can request that the FDA grant approval if there's a threat of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent on the battlefield. The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order “to reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.”
The two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.
OUCH: ""God only knows"" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is “exploiting” human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a “social-validation feedback loop,” Parker said, adding that it is “exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.”
Parker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself ""something of a conscientious objector,"" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. “I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=""7"" class=""red"">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,” Parker said.
</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month. Parker said that when he was helping Facebook get off the ground <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> he and others involved thought: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?”
“And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,"" he said. ""And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you . . . more likes and comments.”
--President Trump, who has blamed China for Americans' increased access to fentanyl, said yesterday he discussed reducing the flow of drugs into the United States with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said that he and the president would be ""focusing on it very strongly,"" without elaborating further.
“Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” Trump said standing alongside Xi, Reuters reported. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,"" the president said.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He added that a ‘special emphasis” would be placed on fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50 to</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 times</span> more addictive than heroin.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later added that Xi ""committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information.""</span> But last week, China’s drug control agency denied Trump’s claim that most fentanyl is produced in China.
-- Meanwhile, the DEA announced yesterday it's taking steps to make it easier to prosecute fentanyl traffickers by temporarily scheduling all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis. That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.
Late last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.
--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare. Starting today, the company will host events to help drivers sign up for marketplace plans in more than two dozen cities from Los Angeles to Indianapolis, Reuters reported.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The company, which employs <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 600,000 U</span>.S. drivers, said <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 150,000 drivers</span> had looked <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2017 insurance</span> plans through its partnership with the consultant group Stride Health.</span> ""This year we’re doubling down on that,” Uber spokeswoman Meghan Joyce told Reuters. The company heavily relies on freelance and contract workers -- a key target population for marketplace enrollments.
--Jimmy Kimmel facetiously celebrated the huge Healthcare.gov enrollment figures for finally allowing him and the president to agree on something.
""I have taken issue with a great many things Donald Trump has done as president but I have to admit, it hasn’t all been bad. In fact, yesterday I was looking at the White House website, healthcare.gov specifically, and I have to admit the health care plan there isn't bad. It's actually pretty good,” Kimmel said on his show Wednesday night.
Kimmel cited The Post’s coverage of record sign ups for what he dubbed ""Trumpcare"" and read out loud messages on social media thanking him for bring “on Trump’s side for once.” Of course, the Trumpcare Kimmel is referring to is still President Obama's Affordable Care Act that Trump keeps promising to repeal.
“If you care about health care, go to Donald Trump’s website, Healthcare.gov,"" Kimmel added.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">--Health and Taxes: The Senate version of a tax bill, which Republicans rolled out yesterday, preserves the popular medical expense deduction that its House counterpart would ditch, the Hill reports.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The deduction allows people with hefty medical costs, who spend more <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> of their gross income on care, to deduct certain qualified expenses like surgery, dentists, eye care, addiction treatment programs or transportation used primarily for or essential to medical care.
</span>""There’s always a sense that it’s a good thing to continue,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The House tax bill has gotten pushback for getting rid of the tax break, which largely benefits low-income families.</span> The Joint Committee on Taxation has said <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 70 percent</span> of the people who claim the deduction make less <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75,000 a</span></span> year.

“Last week Sen. Paul was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood. This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities,"" Doug Stafford said in a statement. ""As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years.""
Stafford added that Paul spoke with his attacker only after his ribs were broken. ""This was not a 'fight,' it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention,"" Stafford said.
Earlier this week, Stafford and Paul both tweeted a link to a Breitbart story that cast a doubt on a report by the New York Times that pointed to landscaping issues as the origin of the altercation:

As Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers
A wide-ranging presidential order helped block a railroad merger and tackle supply-chain problems, and it is planting the seeds for bigger actions.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — As rising inflation threatens his presidency, President Biden is turning to the federal government’s antitrust authorities to try to tame red-hot price increases that his administration believes are partly driven by a lack of corporate competition.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has prodded the Agriculture Department to investigate large meatpackers that control a significant share of poultry and pork markets, accusing them of raising prices, underpaying farmers — and tripling their profit margins during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As gas prices surged, he publicly encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate accusations that large oil companies had artificially inflated prices, behavior that the administration says continued even after global oil prices began to fall in recent weeks.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The push has extended to little-known agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission, which the president has urged to search for price gouging by large shipping companies at the heart of the supply chain.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The turn to antitrust levers stems from Mr. Biden’s belief that rising levels of corporate concentration in the U.S. economy have empowered a few large players in each industry to raise prices higher than a more competitive market would allow.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Corporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.
</span>White House officials concede that their antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately. The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden’s competition agenda.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year’s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The administration’s focus on increasing competition “will spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,” said Brian Deese, who heads the White House’s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And, he added, it “will deliver lower prices for Americans right away.”
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The president’s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,” Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">“Did they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden’s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.
</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were “harming competition in the U.S. economy.”
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration’s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation’s ports and to highlight the companies’ promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.
Overall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden’s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.
</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.

</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world’s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">The commission’s analysis determined that market forces — particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out — are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> “I think it has upped our credibility” with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.
Perhaps the administration’s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">“We’re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,” the report said.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">“Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.”
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“The White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,” said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute’s president.
</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and “Big Meat” has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack’s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.
Mr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden’s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.
“These markets have been concentrated for a long time,” said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. “He didn’t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he’s going to fix it now?”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency’s new “Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program” that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.
</span>“The Biden administration understands this and knows this,” said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, “I would like to see more.”",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,
6638e8d7025a632c3463135c,15267,"<h3>Elizabeth Warren: The Federal Reserve Is Trying ‘To Get More People Fired’</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is coming under increasing political pressure to stop raising interest rates as aggressively as it has done so this year.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced another rate hike Wednesday as Democrats worry Powell’s monetary policy will cause a recession.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He’s pushing hard to get more people fired because he thinks that is one way to help bring down inflation,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“But it’s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.
</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Powell has openly admitted that there’s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But the members of the Fed’s board of governors said they think they’ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed’s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year ― still historically high but down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.2% in</span> September.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Powell described the current strength of the labor market as an obstacle to reducing inflation on Wednesday.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Job growth is very high, wages are very high, vacancies are quite elevated and really there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand,” Powell told reporters.</span> “So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Fed can’t do anything about supply problems caused by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, as Powell has repeatedly admitted.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The only thing the Fed can affect through interest rates is aggregate demand in the economy, and it will take an unknown number of months for consumers to feel the impact.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">At a hearing earlier this year, Warren questioned Powell about whether higher interest rates would reduce prices for food or fuel, and he said they would not.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“The chairman of the Fed has admitted to me in a hearing that those rate hikes will not affect the price of groceries, will not bring down the cost of energy, because of the other forces that have driven up prices,” Warren said.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“The moderation in inflation is one more reminder that we need a lot of data about where prices are moving, and we need it over a longer period of time before the Fed hauls off and takes yet again extremist actions to raise interest rates.”</span>",,,,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 5,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET

WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Fears that the El Niño weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.

</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Niño is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Niño will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yields for Australian wheat—which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprise 14% of</span> the world’s exports—could fall as much <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.

El Niño occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Niño event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.

</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">El Niño caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.

</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be. Of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 26 El</span> Niño weather patterns observed <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1900,</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 17 resulted</span> in widespread droughts in Australia, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology.

“Every El Niño is different, including its duration and intensity, as is its impact on agricultural production,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They said the price impact could be deepest for robusta coffee—used in instant coffee—raw sugar and wheat, crops grown in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil that are likely to be affected by El Niño.

</span>Garry Hansen, a farmer who grows wheat as well as raises cattle and sheep on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8,000</span>-hectare farm in Coomandook in southern Australia, is already concerned about the area’s dryness. The region has had little rain over the last two years.

“We don’t have a lot of moisture in the bank and we are a little bit worried about the forecast. We could do with the rain,” said Mr. Hansen, who added June’s rainfall was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20% of</span> its normal level. He said making sure there were no weeds taking water away from the wheat crop was one of the few things he could do to combat El Niño.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“You have to manage the business like it is going to rain but you also have to maximize water efficiency,” said Mr. Hansen.

Wheat exported from Brisbane on Australia’s eastern coast, near to farmland that could be most affected by El Niño, is already trading at a premium of more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% to</span> wheat shipped from Adelaide in South Australia, said Rob Imray, managing director at commodity marketing firm Farmarco Australia.

</span>It may take a few months before El Niño’s impact is felt in other agricultural commodities. Palm-oil harvests will be affected by drier weather, but the extent won’t be visible until six months after El Niño occurs, Singapore-based Golden Agri-Resources, the second-largest producer of the commodity, said in an email.

“As El Niño has just started, it is currently too early to estimate production output <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2016,</span>” the company said. It said palm-oil farmers could apply fertilizer to their land earlier than normal to help counter any worsening of weather conditions.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">El Niño could boost trading firms that act as middlemen between buyers and sellers of food.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such firms tend to profit more when commodity prices are volatile—provided they read weather and market conditions correctly.

</span>“We are watching [the situation] like a hawk and we will see what happens,” Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Singapore-based trader Olam, said earlier this year. He said El Niño could lead to shortages of wheat, corn and sugar in some Southern Hemisphere countries, although higher rainfall could help crops elsewhere.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Market fears about the impact of El Niño have eased due to a good start to the monsoon season in India and Bangladesh, said Aurelia Britsch, senior commodities analyst at BMI Research.</span> The monsoon season has brought more rain than normal despite earlier forecasts that India’s rainfall would be down <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 12%,</span> while the weather in northern parts of Asia has been broadly in line with historical averages.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Any upward pressure on food prices from El Niño could also be offset by ample stocks of several commodities, particularly of rice, palm oil and sugar, some analysts say.

</span>And while dry conditions could weigh on crop yields in Asia, wetter weather caused by El Niño in South America could boost crops of soybeans, corn and sugar there.

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET

U.S. stocks’</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.

Assets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $50.3 billion</span> in September. The ETF has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">advanced 5.1% over</span> the past month.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Value stocks, often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth, saw the largest divergence in performance from their growth-focused counterparts this decade, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study that looked at the first half of September.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors have pared positions in technology stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns in recent years.

</span>Funds tracking momentum stocks, those that investors are purchasing because they have been rising, recorded last week their first significant outflows since March of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And one of the biggest momentum-focused ETFs has edged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.4% over</span> the past month, underperforming the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> which has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 4.2%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves are the latest sign of how a jumble of contradictory data has investors grappling with two divergent paths for the U.S. economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A recovery from a soft patch in growth would, in theory, boost companies such as financials and energy companies, whose shares have underperformed broader markets over the years.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But an economy weakened by protracted trade conflicts and slowing growth abroad would likely push the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy, providing a tailwind for Treasurys and growth stocks.

</span>Many investors are opting for a nuanced approach. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Hugo Rogers, who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $5 billion</span> as chief investment strategist at Deltec International Group, said his fund this month trimmed positions in Treasurys and gold and picked up shares of oil drillers, including Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. Shares of the S&P 500’s energy sector have zipped past the broader index in the past month, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 8.5%.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We are trading what we think are the early stages of a reversal, and watching out for a bigger reversal that can last for many years,” he said.

</span>A confluence of factors is driving the most recent shift. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many are worried that the world’s biggest central banks are unlikely to loosen monetary policy much further.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Rates in Europe and Japan are already at or near historic lows, while the Fed has signaled that its latest rate cuts are unlikely to be followed by a long easing cycle.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That could spell bad news for the big, momentum-driven technology stocks, which have been a key engine for the market’s gains in recent years.</span> Some of the largest tech stocks have lost steam. Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2016.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 shed</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.8%.</span>

</span>Momentum stocks haven’t been as widely held as they are now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.

</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.

</span>Momentum trades “worked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,” Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span>

Still, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.

</span>“It’s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. “It’s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.”

Yet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn’t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2001.</span>

</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. “A lot of people don’t understand that value cannot die,” she said.

Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world
Bank reserves are normally obscure, even to bankers and professional investors.</span> But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs—known as the overnight repo rate—to spike. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a worry, because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> but it shot up almost as high <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% on</span> Tuesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market.</span> That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">To settle markets down, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has dipped into this market, conducting three auctions this week where banks could swap Treasurys (or bonds from institutions like Fannie Mae ) for new reserves.</span> It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $75 billion</span> in repos.
Here’s is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they’ve come to matter.
What are reserves?
Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.
Central bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called “reserves.” The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.
There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.
What are reserves for?
The main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.
But that’s not what really happens. In fact, the first person’s bank reduces the amount in the person’s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person’s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don’t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.
</span>Where do reserves come from?
One way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Whether it wants to pay government workers’ wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government’s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.
Where does QE come in?
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of QE—quantitative easing—was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.
</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.
</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer’s bank account disappears.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.
</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?
This is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn’t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.
Newsletter Sign-up
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">If banks don’t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn’t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn’t yet been identified.

The upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.
The final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.
The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.
In the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC’s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.
Kickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time — 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there’s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl’s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.
Outside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L’Équipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).
After the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year’s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.
Local sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.
Now, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.
“When you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,” Demoff said.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“You get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.”
Temperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.
It’s been <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.
Across the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.
SoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.
Here are where temperature records were broken in 2021:
A common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, has been that this year’s Super Bowl is “just another game.”
“Obviously it’s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,” Burrow said after Friday’s practice, the last of the season.
Their opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year’s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.
But despite the Bengals’ relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
He said that he and Duke Tobin, the team’s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.
“They certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments — they have proven that over the last two months,” Taylor said. “It’s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we’ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.”
Nine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.
When Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.
Miller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.
Blocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals’ offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.
Burrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams’ pass rush if the Bengals can’t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ticket prices for this year’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.
The Bengals play in one of the league’s smallest markets, but their fans haven’t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).
While the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.
All fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.
Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor “mega” events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.
Away from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.
“You’re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,” Sikka said. “You should test to go to your Super Bowl party.”",,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinton attacks the GOP on climate change. But her plan has a glaring gap.
HILLARY CLINTON has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago — and it has a glaring gap.
Ms. Clinton’s proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn’t taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy.</span> On this, Ms. Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.
Ms. Clinton’s strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Obama’s greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Mr. Obama’s promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 26 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 28 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> increase renewables <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> of the power grid <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2030.</span> Ms. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2027,</span> with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.
To get there, Ms. Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions, a concept that resembles Mr. Obama’s Race to the Top education initiative. She would invest in more energy research and development. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She would also use the tax code to subsidize investment in or electricity production from renewable energy sources, extending and reforming the renewables tax subsidies already on the books.
</span>Yet it’s curious that Ms. Clinton didn’t offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them. Others could include nuclear power or careful use of natural gas in the medium term. What matters is not how the country slashes its emissions but that it does so — and as cheaply as possible.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country’s complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions.</span> This wouldn’t tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Market behavior would therefore become much more rational: Businesses and consumers would use electricity more carefully; the market appeal of low-carbon energy technologies would reflect their real value; government planners would have less influence over the country’s energy future.
</span>The drawbacks are all political. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The term “carbon tax” doesn’t play well.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Cap and trade” has been smeared.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet Ms. Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.</span> Giving the policy its due would hardly be the most politically unrealistic campaign proposal a candidate has offered. Yet it would be among the most reasonable.
Clinton grandee John Podesta assures that “these proposals are only the first steps in an ambitious climate and energy strategy.” We hope so.",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,

6638e8d7025a632c3463135c,28210,"<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball’s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 111 losses</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.
Everywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like “leadership,” “trust” and “desire” filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.
It was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise’s first World Series <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span>
But on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport’s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.
The shock waves have been seismic. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets — all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers’ signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.
</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing “to determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.”
For some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers — whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— tweeted on Thursday: “I would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.”
Wood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.
“The word that keeps popping into my mind is ‘unfathomable,’” said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. “Maybe that’s me being naïve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.”
Suspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.
On Oct.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.
Yet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.
In the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros’ acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.
Taubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.
Houston’s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team’s hierarchy and demoted Ryan’s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.
</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team’s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher’s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.
Over the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s investigators <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.
Even before The Athletic’s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers’ subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.
But they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston’s hitters but sensed something shady.
“When you’d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,” Vogt said. “As a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn’t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.”
It was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While power hitters generally strike out frequently — a trade-off for swinging aggressively — the Astros’ lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 1910 through</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> only two teams — <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians — led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">both 2017 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span>
“I don’t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,” said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros’ hitting coach, explaining the team’s philosophy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: “If you go in with that mind-set, you’re not going to miss your pitch as often.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros’ scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have — possibly costing players money and jobs.
</span>“Now you’re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down” to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, “because they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?”
The Astros’ players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.
“It’s time for the players involved to step forward,” the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. “Take your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there’s some integrity still in you somewhere.”
The ‘model organization’ created a firestorm.
The Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros’ owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.
Some in the Astros’ organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Luhnow, who has a master’s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team’s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team’s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“One of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,” he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> “Depth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.”
Luhnow — who did not respond to an interview request for this article — inherited a team with the majors’ worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.
“The players couldn’t understand why the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">best 25 guys</span> weren’t breaking camp with us,” said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014.</span> “We tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we’d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.”
Even before the N.B.A.’s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word “process” as a euphemism for tanking — a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston’s attendance sank <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team’s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball’s analytical and technological revolution.
“To me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,” said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros’ radio play-by-play voice <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2006 through</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012.</span> “They brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.”
The results began revealing themselves <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros’ database had been hacked by the Cardinals’ scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.
Correa eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.
In hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa — who declined an interview request — could not resist commenting. “Guess who isn’t surprised?” he tweeted.
Baseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros’ explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before — as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.
In the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington’s wins came at the Astros’ park in Houston.
Sign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology. M.L.B. officers monitor video replay rooms now — they did not do so <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 </span></span></span>— and the league will most likely reinforce its rules with prominent signage in clubhouses.
But the Astros’ scandal has brought the issue to a crossroads: Should baseball run from technology to crack down on cheating, or lean into it? League officials are considering a ban on players’ looking at live video during games, yet they are also working on prototypes of electronic signs between catchers and pitchers, though nothing is considered close to game-ready.
Those will not be the only efforts to beat back the Astros’ influence. The M.L.B. players’ union hopes to discourage tanking in the next collective bargaining agreement, and the Astros’ model may already be losing its appeal. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most imitators have not seen the same results, and this winter’s robust free-agent market — after two slow off-seasons — seems to indicate that more teams are trying to be competitive.
</span>The Astros should still be a force on the field this season, if their talent can overcome the organizational upheaval, the public skepticism over their achievements and the newfound awkwardness of their place within the players’ fraternity. In any case, the scandal has disgraced the dominant team of this era — and threatens to swallow up the game.
“None of us, if we looked ourselves in the mirror, would have said, ‘Wow, these guys are morally corrupt, these guys are cheaters,’” said one general manager, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss another team. “Let’s not kid ourselves, they were the model organization. But we know more now.”

Moscow insisted that it would not sell oil that is subject to a price limit agreed upon by the Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span>, even if it means cutting production, adding to questions over whether the plan, which goes into effect on Monday, will succeed in slowing Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 nations</span></span> on Friday agreed to cap the price of Russian crude <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $60 a</span> barrel, putting into place a complex, U.S.-backed plan to limit what Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, can charge for its oil exports.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin’s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules.</span> He said that Russia was “working on mechanisms” to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,” he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union’s embargo on Russian crude imports.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production — which would also harm Russia’s economy — questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression.</span> Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan’s architects were “trying to avoid hard decisions.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $70 a</span> barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $30 a</span> barrel to significantly slash Russia’s revenue.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,
Mr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“The logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $60 instead</span> of, for example,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $30,</span> which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $100 billion</span> a year,” Mr. Zelensky said.
</span>“This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia’s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,” he continued. “This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions.”
The United States had led the push for an agreement along the lines of what was ultimately negotiated. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">After the deal was announced, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen praised the plan.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">It helped “achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,” she said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Western sanctions have so far failed to weaken Moscow’s energy exports: Russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sales than <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">E.U. diplomats have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 countries</span> and allies.
</span>OPEC and its allies, including Russia, said on Sunday that they would leave their quotas for oil production unchanged. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The group, known as OPEC Plus, appears to have decided during a teleconference that there was no reason to alter policy amid the many uncertainties in the oil market.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">On Monday, the European Union will begin an embargo on Russian oil, while the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 industrialized</span> nations and their allies are imposing a price cap <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $60 a</span> barrel on Russian crude.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The looming embargo and the price cap were the chief reasons for the producers’ group to hold its fire.</span> What the outcome of these initiatives will be for oil markets is still to be determined, but they could affect millions of barrels a day of Russian oil. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">OPEC may have decided that it was better off keeping its collective head down rather than risk being blamed if, for instance, prices jump in the coming days.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The coming weeks may see an interplay between the growing difficulties that Russia is likely to have in selling its oil and the effects of a slowing global economy.</span> China will be a key factor. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Lockdowns there are reducing demand for imports.</span> But widespread protests against those restrictions have been followed by some easing of the “zero Covid” rules, offering some hope of a gradual easing and a bounce back in consumption of fuel.
At the moment the oil markets are betting that these momentous shifts can be handled smoothly. But they may be wrong.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">The State of the War
- Russian Oil Price Cap: The E.U. agreed on a $60-a-barrel limit for Russian oil, the latest effort by Western allies to try to deprive Moscow of revenue to finance its war in Ukraine.</span> Here’s how it will work.
- A Pivotal Point: Ukraine is on the offensive, but with about one-fifth of its territory still occupied by Russian forces, there is still a long way to go — and the onset of winter will bring new difficulties.
- Ukraine’s Power Grid: As many Ukrainians head into winter without power or water, crews are racing to restore Ukraine’s battered energy infrastructure, but Russian airstrikes threaten to undo such efforts.
Ukrainian soldiers have raised the national flag at a location on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region, according to a video published by a Ukrainian military unit, an apparent sign of Kyiv’s intent to press its counteroffensive in the south.
The video, released on Saturday, did not indicate that Ukraine had established a permanent military presence on the east bank, which is controlled by Russian forces. Nor did it indicate any concerted effort by Ukrainian forces who recently reclaimed Kherson city to push across the river and attack Russian defensive positions.
But analysts said the video, posted on Telegram by a detachment of the Ukrainian military’s “Carlson” air intelligence unit, signaled Ukraine’s desire to show it would continue its southern counteroffensive even as falling temperatures make fighting more challenging, and as Russian forces continue to fire from their eastern positions toward Kherson city.
The video, set to swelling music and apparently filmed with the intention of sending a message, shows soldiers on three speedboats crossing the river, which is hundreds of yards wide, and docking at an abandoned wooden jetty on an island where small civilian boats were moored. Aerial footage shows the Ukrainian flag draped from high on a crane in the wharf, which the video says is in Olezhky, a district opposite Kherson city. The timing and authenticity of the footage could not be independently confirmed.
“This flag was raised by the fighters of the ‘Carlson’ special unit. It will become a bridgehead for the de-occupation of the left bank of the Kherson region,” an unidentified man in military fatigues said. The left bank refers to the river’s eastern bank.
The area on which the troops landed appeared to be empty, which is consistent with previous Ukrainian and other military reports that Russian forces had largely pulled back from the shoreline northeast of the city of Kherson. The location appeared to be a low-lying, swampy area with few roads, which analysts say Russian forces were unlikely to defend — and which was not a logical starting point for a Ukrainian military push.
Still, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said that if confirmed, the “limited Ukrainian incursion onto the east bank could open avenues for Ukrainian forces to begin to operate on the east bank.”
When Ukraine entered Kherson city three weeks ago after Russian forces withdrew — a watershed moment in the nine-month war — its troops secured the whole of the western bank of the river in the region. The next phase of their counteroffensive in the south would likely involve pushing across the river and trying to reclaim land that stretches south to the coast and leads to Crimea, the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
On Saturday, Ukrainian officials issued an urgent call for civilians to leave Russian-occupied areas on the eastern bank because of “the possible intensification of hostilities in this area.”
Several factors, however, have made further progress uncertain for Ukraine. The river presents a formidable barrier, and the main bridge across, the Antonivsky, is destroyed. Analysts also say that Russian forces withdrew largely intact from Kherson and have spent weeks digging defensive barriers on the eastern side of the Dnipro. The onset of winter, too, has made military operations more difficult, both in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are defending territory they have seized in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
“We’re seeing kind of a reduced tempo, already, of the conflict,” Avril D. Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday. She said that the pace of Ukrainian operations would likely pick up in the spring.
Small units of Ukrainian troops have, for weeks, been running sabotage operations on the river’s eastern bank, laying mines and staging ambushes. At the same time, Russia has been lobbing shells across the river at the city of Kherson and at villages to the north.
On Saturday, one person was killed and two others were injured in a barrage of Russian shelling, said the head of Kherson’s regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, on the Telegram social messaging app.
PARIS — An “essential point” in any peace talks on the war in Ukraine should be how to provide security “guarantees to Russia,” given Moscow’s concerns over NATO, President Emmanuel Macron of France has said.
Mr. Macron’s remarks, in a television interview broadcast on Saturday, picked up a theme he has pursued since before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> but has not repeated of late. “We need to prepare what we are ready to do, how we protect our allies and member states, and how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table,” Mr. Macron said.
“One of the essential points we must address — as President Putin has always said — is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,” he said.
The interview with TF1, a French television network, appeared sympathetic to the concerns of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.
Mr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.
During his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.
There was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron’s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.
David Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron’s proposal on Telegram.
He said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was “leave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.”
The last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span> Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine’s “independence and sovereignty in the existing borders” in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.
<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2019,</span> when he declared the need for the reinvention of “an architecture of security” between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new “stability order” in Europe.
Although he has condemned Mr. Putin’s “imperial” invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.
Responding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron’s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: “Devastating.”
Dr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer’s tweet, saying: “You know you’re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin’s state propaganda praises you. It seems that no matter how brutal Putin is, Macron can’t let go of his flawed vision.”
There is deep suspicion of Mr. Macron’s approach to Russia in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and other states in the European Union and NATO that were once under the Soviet totalitarian yoke. This has undermined his aspirations to European leadership.
On Feb.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> shortly before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Putin set out three demands at a joint news conference with Mr. Macron in Moscow. These were: an end to NATO enlargement; no missile deployments near Russia’s borders; and a reduction of NATO’s military infrastructure in Europe to its levels <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> before the Baltic and central European states previously controlled by Moscow joined the alliance.
The United States dismissed the Russian demands as “non-starters” at the time, but Mr. Macron appears to have a more nuanced view.",,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,

Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:19 pm ET

An October surge in the U.S. dollar is reawakening concerns over financial markets’ vulnerability to a likely Federal Reserve rate increase.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The WSJ Dollar index rose for the eighth time in the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 10 trading</span> days, hitting a high last seen in the spring.</span> It has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 2.4% this</span> month. China set the value of the yuan at a six-year low Wednesday, while currencies in major emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, Mexico declined against the dollar.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The dollar’s strengthening has been accompanied by an increase in long-term bond yields, reflecting wagers that the Fed will raise rates as soon as December, and an autumn recovery in market inflation expectations fueled by oil-price gains.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose by <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.02 percentage</span> point <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.778%,</span> its highest close since early June, while Nymex crude closed <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $50 for</span> a third consecutive day.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The increases in the dollar and U.S. bond yields so far have been modest, while the prices of riskier assets such as stocks have been largely unaffected.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 15.54 points</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 18144.20.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">But many investors say that continued rises in the dollar and bond yields could complicate the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates this year for the second time since the financial crisis, by potentially spurring renewed capital outflows from emerging markets.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Clearly a significant tightening of financial conditions with a strong dollar rally and higher bond yields would be of concern for the Fed,’’ said Gemma Wright-Casparius, senior portfolio manager of the fixed-income group at the Vanguard Group.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">A stronger dollar is generally good for the U.S. economy, boosting the purchasing power of consumers and businesses while holding down inflation.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But a rising dollar also stands to hit U.S. corporate earnings at a time when they already are under pressure and stock valuations are broadly seen as stretched.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It also threatens to hamstring policy makers’ efforts to generate modest inflation gains.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“This Fed is more market dependent than data dependent,’’ said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at asset-management firm Federated Investors.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">If stocks drop significantly prior to the December meeting, he said, “the Fed is very unlikely to raise rates.”

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fed officials meeting in September laid the groundwork to raise short-term interest rates “relatively soon,” according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon, although the officials struggled to reconcile internal divisions over the timing of the next rate move.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Federal-fund futures on Wednesday reflected <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 70% probability</span> of a rate increase by the Fed’s meeting in December, according to data from CME Group.</span> The odds were <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 50% a</span> month ago and nearly zero soon after the Brexit vote.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Eurodollar futures showed the value of net bets wagering on higher interest rates in the U.S. hit a two-year high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.255 trillion</span> for the week ended Oct.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> according to data from TD Securities.

Rising-rate expectations are pushing government-bond yields in the developed world higher after a sharp midyear decline.

</span>The yield on the 10-year German bund yield has risen back above zero again this month, while the 10-year U.K. gilt yield <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 1% Wednesday</span>.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Some analysts say the Fed should welcome the rise in bond yields because it reflects higher confidence among investors over the growth and inflation outlook.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As a result, some investors are selling Treasury bonds and buying Treasury inflation-protected securities in a bid to hedge inflation risks that are perceived to be on the upswing.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The so-called 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.65 percentage</span> point late Wednesday, a five-month high, according to Tradeweb.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The figure suggests investors expect annual U.S. inflation <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.65% in</span> the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 10 years</span>.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">To be sure, few believe inflation is making significant inroads at the moment.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Fed’s favored inflation measure has been below the central bank’s targets for more than four years.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Skeptics point to continuing challenges, such as rising debt and slowing growth in China.

</span>The People’s Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the dollar-yuan pair <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.7258 on</span> Wednesday, marking <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.24% decline</span> in the yuan from Tuesday’s midpoint. Wednesday’s fixing put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2010.</span>

The prospect of slowing growth has been driving money moving out of China and causing the value of the Chinese yuan to weaken. Analysts say China is unlikely to allow disorderly depreciation in the yuan, and that the People’s Bank of China is going to intervene on signs of chaotic yuan moves.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Eric Stein, co-director of global income at asset management firm Eaton Vance Management, said markets “seem far less sensitive” to the yuan’s weakness this time than they were in the market declines of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2015 and</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2016.</span>

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“I don’t think a weaker yuan per se will stop the Fed in its tracks,’’ he said.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">”But if financial conditions broadly tighten, that could stop the Fed from hiking or least force them” to emphasize they don’t expect long-term rates to rise sharply.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 30,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 1</span>:37 pm ET

Mortgage rates dropped <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 4% for</span> the first time since early last year, adding to hopes for a revival in the housing market.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The average rate this week on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.99%,</span> mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Thursday.</span> That marks a fall of nearly a full percentage point from the highs of November. Some lenders have been offering rates well below that.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Lower rates stand to make mortgages more affordable for buyers, and the sharp fall so far <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 has</span> lifted optimism for a market that has cooled after years of torrid home price growth around the country.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Lower rates should “give a boost to the housing market, which has been on the upswing,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, citing home-sales data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The drop in mortgage rates tracks a decline in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which was recently at its lowest <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Yields have fallen amid concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for a protracted trade dispute with China.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economy has remained relatively strong during the first three months of the year.</span> It grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1%,</span> according to data released Thursday. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Still, concerns about an economic slowdown could weigh on the housing market, particularly after a mini boom earlier in the year.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Unlike earlier this year, there is no backlog of buyers waiting to enter the market, and a slowing economy is preventing homebuying sentiment from rising from 10-year lows,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Housing data have been mixed.</span> The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that the number of previously owned houses going into contract <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.5% from</span> the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the measure has been down <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 consecutive</span> months. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">But purchase applications have been trending higher, and new-home sales have mostly been climbing this year.

Millions of workers are doing their day jobs from makeshift set-ups in their living rooms and kitchens, while those in England who can't work from home are now encouraged to go back in if they can do so safely.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">But how exposed to coronavirus might you be in your job?</span> And how does that compare to others?
Data from the UK's Office for National Statistics, based on a US survey, puts into context the risk of exposure to disease, as well as the amount of close human contact workers had before social distancing and other safety measures were introduced.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">See how your job ranks by using the search below.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">While most jobs require people to work relatively closely to others - somewhere in the range between arm's length and a shared office environment - there are very few that typically involve exposure to disease more than once a year.
</span>It's important to note that the data on both exposure to disease at work and how close people are to others is based on interviews that took place with US workers before the pandemic broke out and social distancing recommendations were introduced.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some jobs may find it easier to adjust than others and there may be slightly different working practices and conditions in the US for certain occupations.</span> The results can be expected to be broadly the same in most developed countries.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Almost all the jobs that have a high exposure to both disease and other people are healthcare professions, while those who scored low on both measures include artists, lawyers and those in more typical office jobs like marketing, HR and financial advisers.
</span>Cleaners, prison officers and undertakers are among those who have relatively high exposure to disease without so much close interaction with other people.
But the people who might be most at risk to a new infectious disease like Covid-19, are those who have lots of close contact with people, but aren't used to being exposed to disease.
Bar staff, hairdressers and actors fall into this category, as well as taxi drivers and bricklayers.

Other figures released by the ONS this week showed that deaths in the healthcare sector in the UK are no higher on average than those in the wider community, although social care workers were dying at higher rates. Given that these healthcare occupations are so exposed to both disease and other people, why have there not been more deaths?
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">This could be because workers in these jobs are more likely to be using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves, says Ben Humberstone, deputy director for health analysis at the ONS.</span> They also follow regular hygiene measures like washing hands.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">One of the jobs which had many more coronavirus deaths than the average was taxi drivers.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That's a job which scores highly in terms of closeness to other people, particularly among those jobs which are still actually possible to do at the moment.</span> Bar staff, hairdressers and fitness instructors all score higher, but with bars, gyms and hair salons shut, most of these people will be isolating.
As taxi drivers are less exposed to disease in normal times, there may not be an existing culture of regular hand-washing and wearing PPE. Some firms are trialling partition screens and distributing gloves and masks to protect their drivers and customers.
Methodology
The data in the look-up comes from this release by the ONS.
The figures on proximity to others and exposure to disease come from a survey carried out by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) in which they asked respondents in the US to place themselves on a 1-5 scale for the following two questions.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job?
</span>2. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">How often does your current job require you to be exposed to diseases or infection?
</span>For exposure to disease, a score of one means they are never exposed, while a score of five means they are exposed daily. It's referring to any disease, not coronavirus specifically.
For the physical closeness question, one means the respondent works more than 100ft away from the nearest other person, while five means they need to touch or be near to touching other people at work. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The survey was carried out before social distancing measures were introduced and workers in certain jobs will of course find it easier to adjust than others.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The responses for people in the same jobs were averaged together and extrapolated to form a score <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">We've looked at these scores out of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100 and</span> given each job a ranking.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">If any two jobs had the same score we've given them a tied ranking.

6638e8d7025a632c3463135c,77623,"<h3>Four nursing home residents have died at an evacuation facility, Louisiana officials say.</h3>Extreme Weather and Climate UpdatesSept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> 8:13 p.m. ET
Four Louisiana nursing home residents who were evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ida have died at facility where state inspectors were prevented from conducting a full assessment this week, state officials said on Thursday.
Three of the fatalities have been classified as storm-related by the coroner, though definitive causes of death have not yet been confirmed, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
The deaths occurred at a facility in Tangipahoa Parish, north of New Orleans. Inspectors “promptly visited the site but were expelled from the property,” state officials said in a written statement. “We have significant concerns about conditions in this facility.”
More <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800 residents</span> from seven different nursing homes had been moved to the Tangipahoa Parish facility, and state officials said they are working to find safe placements for them, beginning with the most vulnerable.
As of Thursday morning,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 721 had</span> been moved. A dozen of those required hospitalization.
“We will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement,” the State Department of Health said.
“It’s very disheartening,” said Robby Miller, the Tangipahoa Parish president.
Mr. Miller called the incident is a cautionary tale for others with family members in nursing homes in Louisiana: The conditions and quality of care at an evacuation facility may not be as good as in a typical nursing home.
Some of the nursing home residents have now been moved to a state facility run by Louisiana State University in Alexandria, Mr. Miller said.
The news came as officials in New Orleans announced on Thursday that they were organizing a voluntary evacuation option for residents hoping to get out of the city, which remains largely without electricity.
Details of that plan are still in the works, but it would allow residents to be taken to a state-run shelter outside the city, said Collin Arnold, the New Orleans director of homeland security.
The city would give priority to elderly and disabled residents and then make the option available to the general public, he said.
Across Louisiana, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 594,000 customers</span> remained without power on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the electric utility Entergy. By early afternoon,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,000 power</span> customers in New Orleans had their electricity restored, said Ramsey Green, the city’s deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Entergy hoped to restore full power to the French Quarter and central business district by late Thursday, he said.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 27 electric</span> substations in New Orleans, Mr. Green said,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 are</span> back online.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell, speaking at an afternoon briefing, noted that in addition to electricity, access to fuel continues to be a challenge for city residents. “We just have not received adequate fueling sources to the general public.” Ms. Cantrell promised that “when we get more we shall share more.”
The storm that ripped through southeastern Louisiana on Sunday left a still-untold number of people without homes and wreaked havoc on other essential services. Hundreds of thousands of people found themselves in places where water infrastructure was badly damaged by the storm and pumps and treatment plants were left without power.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, who is expected to visit the state on Friday, said the flash floods that inundated New York City and the powerful winds that knocked out power in Louisiana were a sign that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here” and that the storms and fires creating life-or-death situations across the country constituted “one of the great challenges of our time.”
“Hurricane Ida didn’t care if you were a Democrat or Republican, rural or urban,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, urging Congress to pass his economic agenda when it returned from its recess later this month, in order to provide critical investments in electrical infrastructure.</span> “This destruction is everywhere. And it’s a matter of life and death, and we’re all in this together.”
In the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.
In Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.
“This has become basic-level subsistence,” said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.
This was life, upended, in much of the region — an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.
At a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was “a broken community” that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.
“I had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,” she said. “It looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.”
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — There were several flare-ups during a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.
It was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.
“I feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what’s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,” said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.
She added, “I’m just worried sick.”
On Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.
Conditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.
“This is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it’s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire’s edge now,” he said.
Other firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.
Firefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.
After the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.
“The weather has been working in our favor,” said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. “Look at the Dixie fire.”
Firefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake’s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.
The blaze, which <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and “squirrelly winds” in the Kirkwood area.
But so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.

The Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.
More <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews — sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain — build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.
“It becomes ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing — Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.
By Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.
Southeast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties — the town of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.
“The fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,” said David Hammond,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.
Mr. Hammond’s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, “in case we’ve got to go.”
In other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire’s wrath in challenging terrain.
More <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.
Several towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.
“We would hope that we’re on the downhill slide,” Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. “But after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,” he added, “it’s just hard to venture a guess.”
PHILADELPHIA — As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87,</span> was in his <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.
By late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back. Still, it could be worse.
“I feel so bad for the people who lost property,” he said.
Those people were all over the region on Thursday, as residents of Mid-Atlantic States awoke to a trail of destruction left behind by remnants of Ida, which struck Louisiana as a hurricane days before. Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns — and were still rising.
Officials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.
Tens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.
“Al Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,” said Frank Feingold,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.
The Schuylkill had reached the “major” flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.
“We are still doing water rescues across the city; we’ve done that for the <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 15 hours</span> now continually,” Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. “We know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 100 years</span>,” he added. “And potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.”
The mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. “Extreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,” he said. “They are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.”
In Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L’angolo. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.
“It was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,” he said. “It came halfway up the windows.”
Some of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that “the size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,” with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.
“After last night’s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,” said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “Both waterways have already surpassed all-time records.”
In Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.
The Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">got 10 inches</span> of rain. “I don’t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,” Mr. DiGirolamo said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.
One of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.
</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.
“For me it was just like a flash,” said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. “We tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.”
When he came outside, he found his neighbor’s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink. It wasn’t his.

In the aftermath of a ferocious storm caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida that killed more than three dozen people in four states, national and local leaders acknowledged Thursday that extreme weather events posed an urgent and ongoing threat.
The storm killed at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 people</span> in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut and left more <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150,000 homes</span> without power. States of emergency remained in effect across the region by midday Thursday, as officials sought to get a handle on the damage.
Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm
More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 people</span> were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred.
Speaking from the White House, President Biden said the damage indicated that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” constituting what he called “one of the great challenges of our time.”
At a news conference in Queens on Thursday morning, Gov. Kathy C. Hochul of New York said she had received a call from Mr. Biden, who she said “offered any assistance” as the state assessed the damage from Ida, a storm that she said represented a new normal.
“We need to foresee these in advance, and be prepared,” she said.
The deluge of rain on Wednesday — more than half a foot fell in just a few hours — turned streets and subway platforms into rivers. Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 150 miles</span> per hour. Some rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were still rising.
Ida’s remnants brought historic hourly rainfall to New York and New Jersey.
Each bar represents one recorded hour of precipitation in Newark.
The rain broke records set <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 days</span> before by Tropical Storm Henri, underscoring warnings from climate scientists of a new normal on a warmed planet: Hotter air holds more water and allows storms to gather strength more quickly and grow ever larger.
Many of New York City’s subway lines remained suspended into the evening on Thursday. Airports were open but hundreds of flights had been canceled.
In New York City, the dead ranged in age from a 2-year-old boy to an 86-year-old woman, the police said. Some drowned in basement apartments in Queens, where a system of makeshift and mostly illegally converted living spaces has sprung up.
On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that at <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 23 people</span> in the state had died. They included four people found dead in an apartment complex in Elizabeth and two people were killed in Hillsborough, N.J. after they became trapped in their vehicles, a spokeswoman for the town said. Another death occurred in Passaic, N.J., where the Passaic River breached its banks and fish flopped in the streets.
Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced that the state would lower flags to half-staff to honor Brian Mohl, a state police sergeant whose car was swept away by the floodwaters.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 3.15 inches</span> of rain that fell in Central Park in one hour on Wednesday eclipsed the record-breaking one-hour rainfall <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.94 inches</span> on Aug.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span> The National Weather Service, struggling to depict the level of danger, declared a flash flood emergency in New York City for the first time.
In Bergen County, New Jersey’s most populous county, County Executive James Tedesco, a former firefighter, said on Thursday: “We have not complete devastation but close to it. This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.”

Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue, feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by Hurricane Ida and its aftermath. Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.
Before you give, do your research.
Natural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.
</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.
Donations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.
If you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.
Here are some local organizations in the storm area.
All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.
The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.
Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.
AirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.
SBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.
A number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana’s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.
Bayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.
Louisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.
National organizations are lending a hand.
AmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.
Mercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida’s wake and is accepting donations.
GoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.
Project HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.
The Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 90999.</span>
The Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.
