Powell said policymakers needed to focus on restoring maximum employment.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">As some prominent economists fret that the government might overdo its pandemic response and prompt prices to shoot higher, the nation\u2019s top inflation fighter has a countermessage: Policymakers should stay focused on restoring full employment.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cGiven the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the postpandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said in speech to the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday.</span> \u201cIt will require a societywide commitment.\u201d\nMr. Powell called policies that would bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end as soon as possible \u201cparamount\u201d and said both workers and businesses that had been disrupted by the crisis \u201care likely to need continued support.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Unemployment remains sharply elevated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 6.3 percent</span>, up <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 3.5 percent</span> before the pandemic, and jumps to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span> when adjusted for misclassified job statuses and recent dropouts from the work force.\n</span>The pain has also been uneven. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Employment has dropped <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 4 percent</span> for workers earning high wages but \u201ca <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">staggering 17 percent</span>\u201d for the bottom quartile of earners, Mr. Powell pointed out.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Separately, he noted that \u201cinflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times,\u201d and later added that he did not expect it to accelerate in a sustained way coming out of the pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Economists have often treated high employment and low inflation as conflicting goals.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Policies that foster strong demand and pull workers back into the labor market can push up wages as businesses compete for talent, prompting them to raise prices both because they need to pass along their rising costs and because eager consumers will accept such increases \u2014 at least in theory.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But the arithmetic has shifted in recent decades, as annual inflation remained stuck below the Fed\u2019<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2 percent</span> goal even during long periods of very low joblessness.\n</span>President Biden and top Democrats are moving quickly to try to approve <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.9 billion</span> pandemic relief package. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But some economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, have warned that the large package could touch off long-dormant price increases.</span> Many Republican lawmakers have also cited that risk as a reason to oppose the package.\nMr. Powell did not weigh in on the package specifically, but he did seem to rebut many of those concerns. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He and his colleagues have been unusually vocal in pushing for more fiscal support for the economy throughout the coronavirus era, with some saying the bigger risk is doing too little rather than doing too much.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to get into what is clearly a very active debate,\u201d Mr. Powell said when asked specifically about fiscal policy.</span> But he added that \u201cit is the essential tool for this situation.\u201d\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s own policies are set to stimulate growth.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The central bank cut interest rates to near zero in March and has been buying <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $120 billion</span> in government-backed bonds per month.</span> It aims to keep borrowing cheap and credit flowing to companies and households.\nLow rates are likely to stay for a long time. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell and his colleagues said last year that they would worry only about too little employment, not about too much, and would shoot for periods of slightly higher inflation, aiming to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">average 2 percent</span> over time.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Officials have been clear that they plan to look past a pop in inflation that is expected to occur this year without lifting borrowing costs to cool off the economy.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Inflation is measured by taking the cost of a basket of consumer goods and services and comparing it to the cost of the same products a year earlier.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Prices that dropped sharply in some categories at the start of the pandemic \u2014 think plane tickets, hotel stays and work clothes \u2014 are returning to more normal levels.</span> That means the measure will spike mechanically in relation to the <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">depressed 2020 months</span>.\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \u203a\nLet Us Help You Better Understand the Coronavirus\n- Are coronavirus case counts rising in your region? Our maps will help you determine how your state, county or country is faring.\n- Vaccines are rolling out and will reach many of us by spring. We\u2019ve answered some common questions about the vaccines.\n- Now that we are all getting used to living in a pandemic, you may have new questions about how to go about your routine safely, how your children will be impacted, how to travel and more. We\u2019re answering those questions as well.\n- So far, the coronavirus outbreak has sickened more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 106 million</span> people globally. More than two million people have died. A timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Some economists have warned that a rapid bounce-back in consumer demand fueled by big federal relief packages could push prices higher.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Americans have amassed substantial savings as social distancing policies keep them out of restaurants and malls and as government stimulus checks pad their bank accounts.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">They might spend that money once lockdowns lift even as supply remains constrained; for instance, vacation demand might rebound even with airlines still flying fewer daily routes.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Less clear is whether such a surge would amount to a one-time bounce or a sustained increase that causes consumers and businesses to expect ever-rising prices.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials seem to be betting on the former.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">While prices have shot up temporarily in recent decades, inflation has largely been benign and even a little bit too low for comfort across much of the developed world.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of savings on people\u2019s balance sheets, there is monetary policy, there is fiscal policy \u2014 you could see strong spending growth, and there could be some upward pressure on prices there,\u201d Mr. Powell said Wednesday.</span> \u201cAgain though, my expectation would be that that will be neither large nor sustained.\u201d\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Fed officials have gone so far as to suggest that if a large fiscal stimulus causes prices to rise sooner rather than later, that would be a welcome development.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Central bankers can lift interest rates to control price increases, but it is less clear that they have the tools to reinvigorate price gains on their own.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">A little bit of inflation acts like grease on the wheels of the economy: It may help employers raise wages and allow businesses to adjust to a changing environment, and it leaves the Fed with more room to cut interest rates in a future recession or slowdown.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said during a speech last week, \u201cIt will be critical for monetary policymakers to look through temporary price increases and not even think about thinking about adjusting policy until the economic criteria we have laid out have been realized.\u201d\n</span>Advertisement", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Government revenue and expenses [articles focused on lawmaking and government action including treaties, regulation, taxes, laws, and spending]": "3"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
