McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.\nMany members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members.\u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign.

But when, in <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 1971,</span> a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.\nThe next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women \u2014 guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance \u2014 would be jettisoned.\n\u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Mrs. Schlafly told The Times <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span> \u201cI knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband\u2019s permission to make wine.\u201d\nProponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.\nUnwelcome Revelation\nMrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values.\nAfter her husband died <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993,</span> Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonial-style house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.\nMrs. Schlafly is survived by six children,<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 grandchildren</span> and three great-grandchildren.\nHer son John gained attention <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 when</span> a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe.\u201d\n(John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.)\nMrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies.

The amendment would have expanded women\u2019s rights by barring any gender-based distinctions in federal and state laws, and it was within hailing distance of becoming the law of the land: Both houses of Congress had passed it by a vote of more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span>, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 35 state</span> legislatures \u2014 only three shy of the number required for adoption \u2014 had approved it.\nBut the amendment lost steam in the late 1970s under pressure from Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s volunteer brigades \u2014 mainly women, most of them churchgoing Christians (Mrs. Schlafly was Roman Catholic) and not a few of them lugging apple pies to cajole legislators.

Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">When no government jobs turned up, she found a spot at a conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Association, the forerunner of the American Enterprise Institute.</span> Educating herself in conservative philosophy, she submitted articles against the New Deal to Redbook and other magazines, but they were rejected.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1946,</span> she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell, a Republican. After that, she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and, <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 24,</span> met John Fred Schlafly Jr., a 39-year-old lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct.<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20,</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1949.</span>\nAt the ceremony, Mrs. Schlafly said, she did not promise to obey, only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife, even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel, writing, speaking and campaigning after her oldest child <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">turned 18 months</span>.\n\u201cI want to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me come here\u201d was a favorite opening for speeches. (\u201cI like to say that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know it irritates women\u2019s libbers more than anything else.\u201d)\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs.</span> \u201cPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s formula for the better life, then, is based on marrying a rich professional, climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her,\u201d Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1980.</span>\nMrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1952,</span> after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down, Mrs. Schlafly, who <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27,</span> volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election.\nThat experience, she said, helped her overcome her natural shyness, and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1956 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1964.</span>\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1958,</span> she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation \u2014 named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists \u2014 to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1962,</span> she hosted a 15-minute radio show on national security called \u201cAmerica Wake Up.\u201d It was carried <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 25 Illinois</span> stations.\nThe Schlaflys\u2019 politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism, not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.\nMany members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members.\u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign. In her self-published pocket-size book promoting his candidacy, \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by \u201csecret kingmakers.\u201d By some estimates, the book sold as many <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 3.5 million</span> copies.\nWriting in The New Yorker <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span></span> Elizabeth Kolbert said the book \u201cmixed fact, sensational accusations, commonsensical truths, and elaborate conspiracy theories into a compelling but evidently bogus narrative.\u201d\nMrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> and <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1967 she</span> lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress, from another Illinois district, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> also ended in defeat.\nTargeting the E.R.A.\nDuring much of the 1960s and \u201970s, Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues, often working with Chester Ward, a retired Navy admiral. Their \u201cKissinger on the Couch\u201d (1975) begins with a proposition: \u201cSuppose that Henry Kissinger is, in the common parlance, \u2018some kind of nut or something.\u2019\u201d In more <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800 pages</span>, they argued that he was.\nMrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it, as \u201csomething between innocuous and mildly helpful,\u201d she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when, in <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 1971,</span> a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.\nThe next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women \u2014 guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance \u2014 would be jettisoned.\n\u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Mrs. Schlafly told The Times <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span> \u201cI knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband\u2019s permission to make wine.\u201d\nProponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.\nUnwelcome Revelation\nMrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values.\nAfter her husband died <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993,</span> Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonial-style house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.\nMrs. Schlafly is survived by six children,<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 grandchildren</span> and three great-grandchildren.\nHer son John gained attention <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 when</span> a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe.\u201d\n(John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.)\nMrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies. Even as supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to revive it, Mrs. Schlafly strove to make sure it stayed dead.\nIn March of this year, she endorsed Donald J.

Daily 202: Is Ted Cruz a phony?</h3>THE BIG IDEA:\n\u2014 To stop Ted Cruz, the Republican establishment is working around the clock to caricature the Texas senator as just another career politician who follows the political winds and not core principles.\nThe strategy, being pursued by several of Cruz\u2019s rivals, is aimed squarely at eroding his perceived authenticity, a core strength that has made him the front-runner in Iowa.\nIn this regard, Cruz\u2019s continuing back-and-forth with Marco Rubio over his position on <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2013 Senate</span> bill is about much more than immigration. It\u2019s about whether the Texas senator is just as much a finger-in-the-wind politician as the rest of the pack.\nBeyond just immigration, Rubio\u2019s campaign has blasted out a barrage of press releases and clips this week aimed at portraying Cruz as a flip-flopping politician who will say whatever makes the most political sense at the moment he says it, from crop insurance to defense spending.\n[Get more campaign scoops delivered directly to your email inbox by signing up for The Daily 202]\nCruz has also been hit by the hawks and doves in his party for what they characterize as shifting rhetoric on the U.S. role in the Middle East.\n\u201cI think that Ted Cruz is a man who is lost,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, his hawkish South Carolina colleague and rival in the presidential race. \u201cHe is trying to be an isolationist when that\u2019s hot; he\u2019s trying to be a Lindsey Graham-type when that\u2019s hot.\u201d\nRand Paul released a web video that accused Cruz of being welcoming to Syrian refugees before that became an unpopular position after the Paris attacks.\nChris Christie accused Cruz of opposing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of metadata for political, not philosophical, reasons. \u201cHe went for the easy political vote at a time when it looked like it was a popular thing to do,\u201d the New Jersey governor said on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWith all those dead Parisians, it doesn\u2019t look so popular!\u201d\nThe pro-Christie Union Leader, New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, has run a string of negative editorials pushing the same line of attack. \u201cObsequious pandering to Trump belies Cruz\u2019s well-honed reputation as a maverick standing up to party leadership in defense of conservative principles,\u201d the editorial board said in yesterday\u2019s paper. \u201cCruz had a chance to stand up for conservative principles on stage in Vegas, and he folded like a gambler with a busted flush.\u201d\nPost columnist Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s White House, calls Cruz \u201ca conviction candidate with the challenges of a chameleon\u201d: \u201cAs a presidential candidate, his superpower is to sense exactly where the right is at any given moment and get there himself, with a flourish that leads to a standing O. The problem for Cruz is that the conservative soul has been divided on foreign policy over the past decade, leaving him in an uncomfortable straddle.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a history of outsider mavericks faltering when voters judge that they\u2019re not that different from the insiders they\u2019re challenging. Recall John McCain damaging his reputation for candor <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000 when</span> he equivocated on whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. Gary Hart undermined his bid against Walter Mondale <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 when</span> he flip-flopped on whether the U.S. should move its embassy in Israel, a craven effort to win Jewish votes ahead of the New York primary.\nThe Cruz campaign calls this a false narrative that the base won\u2019t buy, especially because conservative thought leaders like Rush Limbaugh are backing them up. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cTry they might, but no one believes that Cruz is anything but a constitutional, fiscal and social conservative,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler, \u201cand he has the record, unlike his detractors, to back it up.\u201d</span> On the campaign trail, Cruz routinely describes himself as \u201ca consistent conservative.\u201d\nDavid Fahrenthold explores five of the issues on which Cruz has allegedly flip-flopped in a nuanced story that just posted: (1) Should the U.S. military intervene in Syria? (2) Should the United States admit Syrian refugees? (3) Should undocumented immigrants be given a path to legal status? (4) Should the United States offer more temporary visas to highly skilled foreigners? (5) Should money cut from <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3 billion</span> crop-insurance program be restored, giving an expensive boost to farmers?

Pollster Scott Clement points out Clinton\u2019s standing is similar to eight years ago, when she <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 28 points</span> ahead of Barack Obama (though the dynamics <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 are</span> decidedly different), and that the race is much closer in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\nClinton is being helped by the renewed focus on national security:<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 64 percent</span> say she would handle terrorism better than he would. Sanders still leads on honesty, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 44 percent</span> saying he is more honest and trustworthy than she is.\n\u2014 Another fresh poll this morning shows very little change in the GOP race after the Las Vegas debate.

The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters. The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.\u201d Four key lines:\n- NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software.\n- The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.\n- Having his campaign cut off from the national party\u2019s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders \u2014 and could be a devastating blow if it lasts.\n- The episode also raises questions about the DNC\u2019s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.\n\u2014 Pope Francis cleared the way for Mother Teresa to become a saint by crediting the late nun with a second miracle (a Brazilian man who \u201cunexpectedly recovered\u201d from brain tumors <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008 after</span> praying for Teresa\u2019s help).\nGET SMART FAST:\n- A Virginia school district near Charlottesville has canceled classes for today amid furor over a geography teacher assigning students to copy Arabic calligraphy that translates to: \u201cThere is no god but Allah.

His reforms to an internal group that doles out committee assignments were cosmetic, at best, and his early decision to have a wide-open amendment process on a massive highway funding bill has been followed by mostly closed consideration of legislation that needs to pass quickly. On the Boehner vs. Ryan question, House Republicans tend to split into two camps; those who say they trust Ryan more than Boehner, and those who are giving him the early benefit of the doubt.

In a private session at the White House, Mr. Obama explained that his refusal to redeploy large numbers of troops to the region was rooted in the grim assumption that the casualties and costs would rival the worst of the Iraq war. Such a renewed commitment, he said, could require up <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $10 billion</span> a month and leave as many <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 500 troops</span> wounded every month in addition to those killed\u2026. Mr. Obama said that if he did send troops to Syria, as some Republicans have urged, he feared a slippery slope that would eventually require similar deployments to other terrorist strongholds like Libya and Yemen, effectively putting him in charge of governing much of the region.\u201d\n\u2014 Texas Tribune, \u201cRuben Hinojosa wants Ruben Hinojosa\u2019s House seat,\u201d by Jim Malewitz: \u201cHere\u2019s a primary ballot quirk that could leave some Texas voters scratching their heads: One Democratic candidate to replace retiring U.S. Rep.

Their worries stem from skeptical comments she has made about charter schools and teacher evaluations, as well as her close relationship with teachers\u2019 unions, who are critical of both. \u2018There are a lot of deep-pocketed donors who are concerned, and they\u2019re going to hang onto their checkbooks until there is more clarity,\u2019 said Whitney Tilson \u2026 who has given more <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 to</span> Democrats in recent years.

Richard Shelby loaded up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1.1 trillion</span> spending bill with pet provisions, including one measure worth hundreds of millions to a rocket manufacturer with operations in his home state. The cagey lawmaker also fought hard for language protecting red snapper fisheries on Alabama\u2019s Gulf Coast, even issuing a press release bragging about his efforts. \u2026 But in an only-in-Congress twist, Shelby, a very senior member on the appropriations committee, still plans to vote against the sprawling omnibus package. He\u2019s citing the lack of language to restrict Syrian refugees as the reason. The move, however, could make the Republican senator the unofficial chairman of the \u2018hope yes, vote no\u2019 caucus on Capitol Hill. It also demonstrates the potency of immigration as an electoral issue in Alabama and the power of Shelby\u2019s fellow home-state senator, Republican Jeff Sessions, over the controversial topic in the Southern state.\u201d\n\u2014 The Atlantic, \u201cWhy did Sheldon Adelson buy Nevada\u2019s largest newspaper?\u201d by Molly Ball, who was a top political reporter for the Review-Journal before coming to Washington: \u201cThe prospect of Adelson \u2014 the world\u2019s 18th-richest person, who has given tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes \u2014 owning a major piece of the media has provoked understandable anxiety.\u2026 Adelson, who gives few interviews, has a history of hostile relations with the local and national press. In one notable case, he sued a beloved R-J columnist, John L. Smith, driving him into bankruptcy at a time when Smith\u2019s young daughter was being treated for brain cancer. Smith kept fighting, and the suit was eventually dismissed.\u2026\n\u201cIn Israel, he founded a free daily named Israel Hayom that has become popular and influential with a combination of a populist-tabloid sensibility and a hard-right political line. It\u2019s been called the Fox News of Israel; locals have nicknamed it \u2018Bibiton\u2019 for its ardent support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If that\u2019s what Adelson wants for Las Vegas, there will be little to stop him \u2014 and little other place for locals to turn for their news.\u201d\nNevada\u2019s Harry Reid weighed in on the acquisition during his sit-down with The Post yesterday: \u201cI think that he will change that newspaper, and I hope so \u2014 I say that without any question.

It\u2019s about whether the Texas senator is just as much a finger-in-the-wind politician as the rest of the pack.\nBeyond just immigration, Rubio\u2019s campaign has blasted out a barrage of press releases and clips this week aimed at portraying Cruz as a flip-flopping politician who will say whatever makes the most political sense at the moment he says it, from crop insurance to defense spending.\n[Get more campaign scoops delivered directly to your email inbox by signing up for The Daily 202]\nCruz has also been hit by the hawks and doves in his party for what they characterize as shifting rhetoric on the U.S. role in the Middle East.\n\u201cI think that Ted Cruz is a man who is lost,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, his hawkish South Carolina colleague and rival in the presidential race. \u201cHe is trying to be an isolationist when that\u2019s hot; he\u2019s trying to be a Lindsey Graham-type when that\u2019s hot.\u201d\nRand Paul released a web video that accused Cruz of being welcoming to Syrian refugees before that became an unpopular position after the Paris attacks.\nChris Christie accused Cruz of opposing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of metadata for political, not philosophical, reasons. \u201cHe went for the easy political vote at a time when it looked like it was a popular thing to do,\u201d the New Jersey governor said on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWith all those dead Parisians, it doesn\u2019t look so popular!\u201d\nThe pro-Christie Union Leader, New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, has run a string of negative editorials pushing the same line of attack. \u201cObsequious pandering to Trump belies Cruz\u2019s well-honed reputation as a maverick standing up to party leadership in defense of conservative principles,\u201d the editorial board said in yesterday\u2019s paper. \u201cCruz had a chance to stand up for conservative principles on stage in Vegas, and he folded like a gambler with a busted flush.\u201d\nPost columnist Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s White House, calls Cruz \u201ca conviction candidate with the challenges of a chameleon\u201d: \u201cAs a presidential candidate, his superpower is to sense exactly where the right is at any given moment and get there himself, with a flourish that leads to a standing O. The problem for Cruz is that the conservative soul has been divided on foreign policy over the past decade, leaving him in an uncomfortable straddle.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a history of outsider mavericks faltering when voters judge that they\u2019re not that different from the insiders they\u2019re challenging. Recall John McCain damaging his reputation for candor <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000 when</span> he equivocated on whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. Gary Hart undermined his bid against Walter Mondale <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 when</span> he flip-flopped on whether the U.S. should move its embassy in Israel, a craven effort to win Jewish votes ahead of the New York primary.\nThe Cruz campaign calls this a false narrative that the base won\u2019t buy, especially because conservative thought leaders like Rush Limbaugh are backing them up. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cTry they might, but no one believes that Cruz is anything but a constitutional, fiscal and social conservative,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler, \u201cand he has the record, unlike his detractors, to back it up.\u201d</span> On the campaign trail, Cruz routinely describes himself as \u201ca consistent conservative.\u201d\nDavid Fahrenthold explores five of the issues on which Cruz has allegedly flip-flopped in a nuanced story that just posted: (1) Should the U.S. military intervene in Syria? (2) Should the United States admit Syrian refugees? (3) Should undocumented immigrants be given a path to legal status? (4) Should the United States offer more temporary visas to highly skilled foreigners? (5) Should money cut from <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3 billion</span> crop-insurance program be restored, giving an expensive boost to farmers? Read the whole thing here.\nHarry Reid blasted Rubio and defended Cruz in an interview with The Post: \u201cI just think what Rubio has done on immigration is one of the worst, worst machinations in politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the Senate minority leader said yesterday. \u201cIt shows a lack of character in my opinion.\u201d Reid said both Rubio and Cruz are \u201cnon-entities in the Senate,\u201d but he gave the Texan a back-handed compliment: \u201cYou never have to guess where he is. He\u2019s not winning personality contests here. Cruz is just who he is. He just is a very, very smart man marching forward with some ideas I don\u2019t like.\u201d (Kelsey Snell\u2019s write-up)\nA new Cruz ad going on TV this morning has Cruz touting his record on immigration: \u201cSecuring our borders and stopping illegal immigration is a matter of national security,\u201d the senator says directly to the camera. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fought so hard to defeat President Obama and the Republican establishment\u2019s Gang of Eight amnesty plan. Their misguided plan would have given Obama the authority to admit Syrian refugees, including ISIS terrorists.\u201d Watch here.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\u2014 \u201cAmerican-led airstrikes killed at <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 180 Islamic</span> State fighters as local Kurdish forces scrambled to repel a bold, multi-pronged assault by the militants,\u201d Missy Ryan and Loveday Morris report from Iraq.\n\u2014 Ahead of tomorrow night\u2019s Democratic debate, a fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Clinton with a 2-1 edge over Sanders in the national race:<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59 percent</span> of Democratic-leaning registered voters support her, compared <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 28 percent</span> for him. He\u2019s down <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 34 percent</span> in November. Pollster Scott Clement points out Clinton\u2019s standing is similar to eight years ago, when she <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 28 points</span> ahead of Barack Obama (though the dynamics <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 are</span> decidedly different), and that the race is much closer in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\nClinton is being helped by the renewed focus on national security:<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 64 percent</span> say she would handle terrorism better than he would. Sanders still leads on honesty, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 44 percent</span> saying he is more honest and trustworthy than she is.\n\u2014 Another fresh poll this morning shows very little change in the GOP race after the Las Vegas debate. A Morning Consult survey that was in the field the past two nights puts Trump <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 36 percent</span> nationally, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 percent</span> for Ben Carson,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11 percent</span> for Cruz,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 percent</span> for Rubio <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 7 percent</span> for Jeb. That\u2019s basically the same as their poll conducted during the three days before the debate. The sample <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">included 2,201 registered</span> Republican and Republican-leaning voters. One-third was conducted through live telephone interviews, one-third by IVR and one-third online. (Here are the toplines and the crosstabs.)\n\u2014 A Sanders staffer was fired after the DNC accused the campaign of improperly accessing Clinton\u2019s confidential voter file: \u201cJeff Weaver, the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign manager, acknowledged that a low-level staffer had viewed the information but blamed a software vendor hired by the DNC for a glitch that allowed access,\u201d Rosalind Helderman, Anne Gearan and John Wagner report. \u201cWeaver said one Sanders staffer was fired over the incident. The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters. The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.\u201d Four key lines:\n- NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software.\n- The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.\n- Having his campaign cut off from the national party\u2019s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders \u2014 and could be a devastating blow if it lasts.\n- The episode also raises questions about the DNC\u2019s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.\n\u2014 Pope Francis cleared the way for Mother Teresa to become a saint by crediting the late nun with a second miracle (a Brazilian man who \u201cunexpectedly recovered\u201d from brain tumors <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008 after</span> praying for Teresa\u2019s help).\nGET SMART FAST:\n- A Virginia school district near Charlottesville has canceled classes for today amid furor over a geography teacher assigning students to copy Arabic calligraphy that translates to: \u201cThere is no god but Allah.

Marquez,<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> was charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of firearms used in the attack and defrauding immigration officials\u2026. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He faces up <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 35 years</span> in prison if convicted.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cInside the lobbying campaign to end the ban on crude oil exports,\u201d by Catherine Ho: \u201cFor oil and energy lobbyists who for years have worked to convince Congress to end a decades long ban on crude oil exports, the tide shifted in their favor this past summer with the help of an unlikely ally: the White House.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">In July, the Obama administration and other world powers announced an end to sanctions against Iran as part of a deal to curb the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities, which led Tehran to later say it will soon double its crude oil exports.</span> This gave the oil industry some crucial political leverage\u2026. Domestic oil production has nearly doubled <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008,</span> largely because of the shale oil boom in North Dakota and Texas that led to an overabundance of light crude oil. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Most refiners in the United States are configured to process heavy or medium crude oil, leaving the producers of light crude oil with too much product and not enough refineries to buy it.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cCongress looks to clear year-end budget deal,\u201d by Kelsey Snell: \u201cCongress on Friday is poised to clear the year-end tax and spending deal as lawmakers seek to wrap up the remaining congressional business with members itching to head home for the holidays.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Despite some grumbling in both parties over the contents of the deal \u2013 <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.1 trillion</span> spending bill and <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $622 billion</span> package of tax cuts \u2013 it is expected to be approved by both chambers.</span> But the House vote on the appropriations package, which will occur Friday morning, could be close. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On Thursday the House passed the tax portion of the agreement on <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 318 to</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 109 vote</span>.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u2026 House Republicans provided most of the needed votes,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 241,</span> to pass the tax package, which House Democratic leaders oppose because they say it is too expensive and does not do enough for low-income workers.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opposed the tax agreement but said she will vote for the spending bill.\u201d</span> Pelosi also sent a letter late Thursday to House Democrats urging them to back the spending agreement.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u2014 \u201cPaul Ryan notches a big victory, but the true test may come next year,\u201d by Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane: \u201cConservatives credit Paul Ryan with moving to open the appropriations process in the immediate aftermath of the budget deal negotiated by John Boehner in his final days, an accord that lifted spending caps that many Republicans wanted to maintain.</span> Pressed about the difference under Ryan, rank-and-file lawmakers could not point to specific changes made by the new speaker. His reforms to an internal group that doles out committee assignments were cosmetic, at best, and his early decision to have a wide-open amendment process on a massive highway funding bill has been followed by mostly closed consideration of legislation that needs to pass quickly. On the Boehner vs. Ryan question, House Republicans tend to split into two camps; those who say they trust Ryan more than Boehner, and those who are giving him the early benefit of the doubt. The latter group has decided to rally around the new leader, saying that the real verdict on his leadership will come next year.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cWhat it\u2019s like in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally,\u201d by Stephanie McCrummen in Mesa, Ariz.: \u201cA white-haired man in suede wingtips would punch a protester. A young man would shout \u2018mother f\u2014ing tacos!\u2019 at two Latino protesters. \u2026 For the most part, people were not exactly coming to hear Trump. Most already knew what he had to say about banning Muslims from entering the United States, or \u2018bombing the s\u2014 \u2018 out of the Islamic State, or building a wall to keep out Mexicans he has described as rapists and drug traffickers. They had read his books, had seen him on the news. Instead, they were here to be part of something larger than themselves: part of the Trump Crowd, at this point a phenomenon in and of itself that has become more raucous and sporadically violent as this primary season of fear and anger has progressed.\u201d\n\u2014 Why the Secret Service doesn\u2019t see its agents as responsible for keeping the peace at Trump\u2019s out-of-control events: \u201cMuch of the peacekeeping burden during rallies falls on private security guards and off-duty police hired by the campaign and event venue operators,\u201d David Nakamura and Carol Leonnig write. \u201cLocal police are often on duty outside events to monitor traffic and security issues in public places, but they are not responsible for removing protesters on private property. And while the Secret Service began providing protection to Trump in November \u2026 agents are trained to intervene only if there is a direct threat to the candidate. As a result, some experts said, if shoving or fighting breaks out, it is not always clear who is responsible for protecting the safety of the public, including protesters.\u201d Secret Service officials said that engaging in crowd control could divert agents from monitoring the candidate. \u201cThe U.S. Secret Service cannot get sucked into the chaos,\u201d said Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent.\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL: Here\u2019s how the Cruz vs. Rubio spat looks through analytics.

Their worries stem from skeptical comments she has made about charter schools and teacher evaluations, as well as her close relationship with teachers\u2019 unions, who are critical of both. \u2018There are a lot of deep-pocketed donors who are concerned, and they\u2019re going to hang onto their checkbooks until there is more clarity,\u2019 said Whitney Tilson \u2026 who has given more <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 to</span> Democrats in recent years.

He\u2019s citing the lack of language to restrict Syrian refugees as the reason. The move, however, could make the Republican senator the unofficial chairman of the \u2018hope yes, vote no\u2019 caucus on Capitol Hill.

Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters\nA recommendation is expected at Thursday\u2019s meeting, which you can watch below, on whether to authorize a third dose for many recipients of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday, the panel will consider boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.\nA key federal advisory committee is beginning two days of meetings that are expected to strongly influence decisions on whether at least some recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines will soon be eligible for booster shots.\nAfter hearing from Moderna officials, Food and Drug Administration scientists, members of the public and others, the panel of outside experts advising the F.D.A. is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend emergency authorization of a third shot for recipients of Moderna\u2019s vaccine. (You can watch the meeting here.)\nThe panel will vote Friday on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s request for emergency authorization of a second dose. While regulators are not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, they typically do.\nThe panel may be more skeptical of a booster shot for Moderna recipients than for Johnson & Johnson. Some vaccine experts have long argued that Johnson & Johnson should be a two-dose vaccine since its effectiveness is lower than those of the shots produced by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\nPfizer-BioNTech won authorization for a booster shot for many recipients last month after arguing that its vaccine, while highly protective in the early months, lost some potency against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization over time.\nBut Moderna\u2019s potency against hospitalization has held up better over time than Pfizer\u2019s, according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn documents released Tuesday, Moderna did not argue that its vaccine requires a booster to prevent severe disease or hospitalization. Instead, it concentrated its arguments on preventing infection and mild to moderate disease.\nModerna said the mean antibody level of participants in its study <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 1.8 times</span> higher after the booster than it was after the second shot. In another measurement, the booster raised neutralizing antibodies at least fourfold <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 87.9 percent</span> of people compared to after the second dose, narrowly failing to meet the agency\u2019s requirement <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 88.4 percent</span>.\nGiven that Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to still strongly protect against severe disease, at least some committee members are expected to balk at recommending a third dose. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be a slam dunk,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, of the panel\u2019s vote. \u201cMaybe we should wait a little bit longer on Moderna, let it drop off more first before we boost.\u201d\nOne of the first presentations Thursday will come from Israeli health officials, who will discuss results of their booster campaign using Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.\nThe Biden administration has been closely watching Israel\u2019s experience because the country has a nationalized health care system that allows it to closely track recipients. The Israeli officials are expected to say that rates of infection and serious disease are significantly lower among those who got a booster shot than among those who did not. Israel\u2019s definition of severe disease is significantly broader than the one used in the United States.\nSince Israel\u2019s data deal only with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, it is not clear how much weight committee members will give it. But it will provide them with more information than they had last month before voting to recommend a booster for a broad swath of Pfizer recipients.\nIsraeli scientists analyzed rates of infection and severe illness <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 4.6 million</span> people from <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 30,</span> when the country first began offering booster shots, to Oct.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span> They found that infection rates at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 days</span> after a third injection were five- to 11-fold lower among the boosted population than among those who did not receive an extra injection.\nRates of severe illness were<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span>5-fold lower for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">those 60 years</span> or older and threefold lower for those <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">aged 40 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> the researchers said. Death rates were nearly fivefold lower for those <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">aged 60 and</span> up.\nThe Israeli results have been published by a preprint service but have not been peer-reviewed.\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Oct. 13||14-day change|\n|New cases||88,612||\u201322%|\n|New deaths||1,887||\u20135%|\nAn independent panel of experts advising the Food and Drug Administration is meeting regarding Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccine booster shot on Thursday, and on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s on Friday. Each day will culminate in a vote by the panel on whether to recommend emergency authorization for that booster for recipients of that vaccine.\nSo what happens after the panel votes? There are further steps at the F.D.A., then steps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the process ends with the states. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:\nThe F.D.A.\nThe F.D.A., a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services that controls and supervises medications and other elements related to public health, takes up the advisory panel\u2019s recommendation, which includes the question of who should be eligible. The advisory panel\u2019s votes are not binding, but the F.D.A. typically follows them.\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s top official \u2014 its acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock \u2014 issues the agency\u2019s final determination on whether to authorize the boosters and for whom. Such decisions are typically issued within a few days of advisory committee meetings.\nThe C.D.C.\nAn advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States\u2019 public health agency, reviews the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. On Thursday and Friday of next week, that panel is scheduled to meet and vote on its recommendations regarding boosters.\nThe C.D.C. takes up that panel\u2019s recommendations, and the agency\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, issues the agency\u2019s guidance on whether boosters should be used and who should be eligible. That guidance is deeply influential for states, doctors, pharmacies and other health care institutions and the general public. As with the process at the F.D.A., the panel\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the C.D.C. usually follows them.\nHowever, there was a rare exception last month: When a C.D.C. advisory panel rejected the F.D.A.\u2019s recommendation that frontline workers be included among those eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, Dr. Walensky overrode her own agency\u2019s advisers and sided with the F.D.A.\nThe states\nState health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C.

Still, Ms. Dunn, the former mayor of Tuskegee, contemplated for months whether to be inoculated.\nIt was a complicated consideration, framed by the government\u2019s botched response to the pandemic, its disproportionate toll on Black communities and an infamous 40-year government experiment for which her hometown is often associated.\n\u201cI thought about the vaccine most every day,\u201d said Ms. Dunn,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 78,</span> who finally walked into a pharmacy this summer and rolled up her sleeve for a shot, convinced after weighing with her family and doctor the possible consequences of remaining unvaccinated.\n\u201cWhat people need to understand is some of the hesitancy is rooted in a horrible history, and for some, it\u2019s truly a process of asking the right questions to get to a place of getting the vaccine.\u201d\nIn the first months after the vaccine rollout, Black Americans were far less likely than white Americans to be vaccinated. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining shots in their communities, their hesitancy was fueled by a powerful combination of general mistrust of the government and medical institutions, and misinformation over the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.\nBut a wave of pro-vaccine campaigns and a surge of virus hospitalizations and deaths this summer, mostly among the unvaccinated and caused by the highly contagious Delta variant, have narrowed the gap, experts say. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">So, too, have the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s full approval of a vaccine and new employer mandates.</span> A steadfast resistance to vaccines in some white communities may also have contributed to the lessening disparity.\nSouth Korea plans to ship <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 1.6 million</span> doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine to Vietnam and Thailand this week, the foreign ministry announced Tuesday, as the Southeast Asian nations struggle to contain the spread of the virus.\nThe donation comes as South Korea\u2019s vaccination program has accelerated rapidly, <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the population expected to be inoculated by the end of the month.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 62 percent</span> of South Korea\u2019s total population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the nation is expected to ease the most severe restrictions by next month.

Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters</h3>Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters\nA recommendation is expected at Thursday\u2019s meeting, which you can watch below, on whether to authorize a third dose for many recipients of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday, the panel will consider boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.\nA key federal advisory committee is beginning two days of meetings that are expected to strongly influence decisions on whether at least some recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines will soon be eligible for booster shots.\nAfter hearing from Moderna officials, Food and Drug Administration scientists, members of the public and others, the panel of outside experts advising the F.D.A. is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend emergency authorization of a third shot for recipients of Moderna\u2019s vaccine. (You can watch the meeting here.)\nThe panel will vote Friday on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s request for emergency authorization of a second dose. While regulators are not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, they typically do.\nThe panel may be more skeptical of a booster shot for Moderna recipients than for Johnson & Johnson. Some vaccine experts have long argued that Johnson & Johnson should be a two-dose vaccine since its effectiveness is lower than those of the shots produced by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\nPfizer-BioNTech won authorization for a booster shot for many recipients last month after arguing that its vaccine, while highly protective in the early months, lost some potency against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization over time.\nBut Moderna\u2019s potency against hospitalization has held up better over time than Pfizer\u2019s, according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn documents released Tuesday, Moderna did not argue that its vaccine requires a booster to prevent severe disease or hospitalization. Instead, it concentrated its arguments on preventing infection and mild to moderate disease.\nModerna said the mean antibody level of participants in its study <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 1.8 times</span> higher after the booster than it was after the second shot. In another measurement, the booster raised neutralizing antibodies at least fourfold <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 87.9 percent</span> of people compared to after the second dose, narrowly failing to meet the agency\u2019s requirement <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 88.4 percent</span>.\nGiven that Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to still strongly protect against severe disease, at least some committee members are expected to balk at recommending a third dose. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be a slam dunk,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, of the panel\u2019s vote. \u201cMaybe we should wait a little bit longer on Moderna, let it drop off more first before we boost.\u201d\nOne of the first presentations Thursday will come from Israeli health officials, who will discuss results of their booster campaign using Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.\nThe Biden administration has been closely watching Israel\u2019s experience because the country has a nationalized health care system that allows it to closely track recipients. The Israeli officials are expected to say that rates of infection and serious disease are significantly lower among those who got a booster shot than among those who did not. Israel\u2019s definition of severe disease is significantly broader than the one used in the United States.\nSince Israel\u2019s data deal only with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, it is not clear how much weight committee members will give it. But it will provide them with more information than they had last month before voting to recommend a booster for a broad swath of Pfizer recipients.\nIsraeli scientists analyzed rates of infection and severe illness <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 4.6 million</span> people from <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 30,</span> when the country first began offering booster shots, to Oct.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span> They found that infection rates at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 days</span> after a third injection were five- to 11-fold lower among the boosted population than among those who did not receive an extra injection.\nRates of severe illness were<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span>5-fold lower for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">those 60 years</span> or older and threefold lower for those <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">aged 40 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> the researchers said. Death rates were nearly fivefold lower for those <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">aged 60 and</span> up.\nThe Israeli results have been published by a preprint service but have not been peer-reviewed.\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Oct. 13||14-day change|\n|New cases||88,612||\u201322%|\n|New deaths||1,887||\u20135%|\nAn independent panel of experts advising the Food and Drug Administration is meeting regarding Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccine booster shot on Thursday, and on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s on Friday. Each day will culminate in a vote by the panel on whether to recommend emergency authorization for that booster for recipients of that vaccine.\nSo what happens after the panel votes? There are further steps at the F.D.A., then steps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the process ends with the states. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:\nThe F.D.A.\nThe F.D.A., a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services that controls and supervises medications and other elements related to public health, takes up the advisory panel\u2019s recommendation, which includes the question of who should be eligible. The advisory panel\u2019s votes are not binding, but the F.D.A. typically follows them.\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s top official \u2014 its acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock \u2014 issues the agency\u2019s final determination on whether to authorize the boosters and for whom. Such decisions are typically issued within a few days of advisory committee meetings.\nThe C.D.C.\nAn advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States\u2019 public health agency, reviews the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. On Thursday and Friday of next week, that panel is scheduled to meet and vote on its recommendations regarding boosters.\nThe C.D.C. takes up that panel\u2019s recommendations, and the agency\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, issues the agency\u2019s guidance on whether boosters should be used and who should be eligible. That guidance is deeply influential for states, doctors, pharmacies and other health care institutions and the general public. As with the process at the F.D.A., the panel\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the C.D.C. usually follows them.\nHowever, there was a rare exception last month: When a C.D.C. advisory panel rejected the F.D.A.\u2019s recommendation that frontline workers be included among those eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, Dr. Walensky overrode her own agency\u2019s advisers and sided with the F.D.A.\nThe states\nState health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C.

The average number of bookrunners on Chinese companies\u2019 U.S.-dollar bond deals rose <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 last</span> year, from an average <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 3.6 in</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> according to Dealogic.

green up pointing triangle were among seven banks that recently helped sell a total <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.3 billion</span> in dollar-denominated bonds from three state-owned Indian companies, effectively providing their services free of charge. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The three Indian companies paid a dollar in underwriting fees to each bank that handled the sales, according to company representatives and people familiar with the matter.\n\n</span>A similar trend is emerging among banks underwriting some Chinese bond offerings, bankers say, particularly in the case of state-owned corporations that have large pools of underwriters to choose from and tend to be stingier with fees.\n\nBanks that agree to arrange bond offerings for ultralow fees are generally hoping to build relationships with corporate clients for future deals. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They are also hoping to generate revenue from related businesses, such as fees for setting up foreign-currency swaps or on bond-trading commissions.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In some cases, local brokerages have been aggressively slashing fees to win bond underwriting mandates, leading issuers to demand global banks do the same, bankers say.\n\n</span>Asian companies excluding Japan sold <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $334 billion</span> in U.S.-dollar bonds <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017,</span></span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 60% from</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> according to Dealogic. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">More than half the bonds were issued by Chinese companies, which, in many cases, enjoyed strong investor demand for their debt.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But market participants say global banks\u2019 underwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn\u2019t keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It is raising concerns that this core investment-banking business could become largely unprofitable in the fast-growing region.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cFee income from bonds in Asia has not grown proportionately to deal volumes,\u201d said Clifford Lee, managing director and head of fixed income, treasury and markets at DBS Bank in Singapore.\n\n</span>In the U.S., underwriting fees, in recent years, have averaged <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 0.7 percentage</span> point on investment-grade corporate bonds, meaning that for <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1 billion</span> bond issue, companies would pay <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $7 million</span> to banks arranging the sale. For U.S. high-yield, or \u201cjunk,\u201d bonds, the fee <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averages 1.2 percentage</span> points, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\n\nFees in Asia are generally lower and can vary widely, bankers say. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Chinese banks, including state-owned Bank of China Ltd. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., paid <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.1 percentage</span> point fee on recent bond sales, according to a person familiar with the matter.</span> Some companies are more generous.

The average number of bookrunners on Chinese companies\u2019 U.S.-dollar bond deals rose <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 last</span> year, from an average <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 3.6 in</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> according to Dealogic.

The country paid the banks, which included Chinese, U.S. and European banks, a total fee <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $2 million</span>, <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 0.1 percentage</span> point.

Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Starbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market\u2014the U.S.\u2014for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5%.</span>\n\n</span>Mr. Schultz said the company\u2019s plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries.</span> \u201cThey never protected themselves on the high end,\u201d he said of beer companies. \u201cI think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.\n\nMillennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Between 2008 and</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 36% from</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13%,</span> while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 41% from</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19%,</span> according to the National Coffee Association.\n\nConsumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers\u2019 names was an average <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $9.95 higher</span> per pound than those that didn\u2019t, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Andrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 7% to</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8% annually</span>, compared <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 1% to</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2% for</span> all coffee.\n\n</span>Starbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald\u2019s Corp., Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc.\u2019s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee

Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Starbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market\u2014the U.S.\u2014for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5%.</span>\n\n</span>Mr. Schultz said the company\u2019s plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries.</span> \u201cThey never protected themselves on the high end,\u201d he said of beer companies. \u201cI think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.\n\nMillennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Between 2008 and</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 36% from</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13%,</span> while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 41% from</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19%,</span> according to the National Coffee Association.\n\nConsumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers\u2019 names was an average <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $9.95 higher</span> per pound than those that didn\u2019t, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Andrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 7% to</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8% annually</span>, compared <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 1% to</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2% for</span> all coffee.\n\n</span>Starbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald\u2019s Corp., Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc.\u2019s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee and espresso drinks on the cheap.\n\n</span>\u201cIn coffee you have to pick a path,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst Jason West.\n\nStill, the only proof of the new Starbucks concept is the Seattle

been made yet\n\nUpdated Nov.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 4</span>:09 pm ET\n\nThe Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates in mid-December so long as the U.S. economy remains on track, Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Fed expects that \u201cthe economy will continue to grow at a pace that is sufficient to generate further improvements in the labor market and to return inflation to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">our 2% target</span> over the medium term, and if the incoming information supports that expectation, then...</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">December would be a live possibility,\u201d Ms. Yellen said while testifying before the House Financial Services Committee.</span> \u201cBut importantly, we\u2019ve made no decision about it.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Her remarks were echoed later Wednesday by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley, who serves as vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee.</span> Mr. Dudley, too, described December as a \u201clive possibility\u201d for a rate increase and added, \u201cbut let\u2019s see what the data shows.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Fed has kept its benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal-funds rate, pinned near zero since <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s policy committee decided to hold rates near zero in mid-September but signaled in a statement last week that a rate increase was possible \u201cat its next meeting\u201d on Dec. 15-16.\n\n</span>On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen reinforced that message. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">She described the U.S. economy as \u201cpretty strong and growing at a solid pace\u201d despite some weakness \u201cspilling over to us from the global economy.\u201d</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">She repeated that raising rates soon would allow the Fed to tighten monetary policy at a gradual pace; in a speech in late September, she warned delay could force the Fed to raise rates more quickly and possibly push the economy into recession.\n\n</span>\u201cMoving in a timely fashion, if the data and the outlook justify such a move, is a prudent thing to do because we will be able to move at a more gradual and measured pace,\u201d Ms. Yellen told lawmakers. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe fully expect that the economy will evolve in such a way that we can move at a very gradual pace, and of course, after we do so, we will be watching very carefully whether our expectations are realized.\u201d\n\nFed governor Lael Brainard last month called for caution on raising rates, citing weakness overseas and persistently low domestic inflation.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">As measured by the Commerce Department\u2019s personal consumption expenditures price index, U.S. inflation has undershot the central bank\u2019<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% annual</span> target for more than three years.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen, referring Wednesday to Ms. Brainard\u2019s remarks, told lawmakers that \u201cif we were to move, say in December, it would be based on an expectation\u2014which I believe is justified\u2014that with an improving labor market and transitory factors fading, that inflation will move up <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%.</span></span> But of course if we were to move, we would need to verify over time that expectation was being realized, and if not, adjust policy appropriately.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In projections released in September, one unnamed Fed policy maker recommended lowering the benchmark fed-funds rate into negative territory.</span> Ms. Yellen said at the time that the idea wasn\u2019t under serious consideration and on Wednesday reiterated that she doesn\u2019t see the

But she did leave the door open to considering it in the future.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">If the economic outlook \u201cwere to deteriorate in a significant way so that we thought we needed to provide more support to the economy, then potentially anything\u2014including negative interest rates\u2014would be on the table,\u201d she said.</span> \u201cBut we would have to study carefully how they would work here in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMichael S.

But internet-service providers such as Comcast Corp. or Verizon Communications Inc. would be free to make all sorts of big changes, such as offering new packages with pricing schemes that deliver some kinds of content but not others. One type of service that could proliferate in the new regime is zero-rating deals, where specific websites or services are exempted from a mobile carrier\u2019s data caps.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In his official comment on Thursday, Mr. Pai, the architect of the new rules, emphasized the need to reinvigorate broadband investment in the face of huge and growing consumer demand.\n\n</span>\u201cSimply put, by returning to the light-touch [regulatory] framework, we are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have stronger incentives to build networks, especially in unserved areas, and to upgrade networks to gigabit speeds and [next-generation 5G wireless].... In short, it\u2019s a freer and more open internet.\u201d\n\nBut the issue, which has been the subject of public policy debates for more than a decade, has stirred activists who view a tightly regulated, open internet as a powerful force for democracy and opportunity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Those groups stepped up their activity ahead of the Thursday vote, arguing that the change threatens to hit consumers with higher prices and to Balkanize the internet.\n\n</span>Much of that opposition was led by major internet firms such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. They have worried for years that internet providers would use their outsize influence to extract unfair fees or promote their own content.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision from the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality is disappointing and harmful,\u201d said Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cAn open internet is critical for new ideas and economic opportunity\u2014and internet providers shouldn\u2019t be able to decide what people can see online or charge more for certain websites.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that it was \u201ccommitted to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support, have been approved by the courts, and are working well for every part of the internet economy.\u201d\n\n</span>The new rules could allow novel alliances between broadband providers and major entertainment, shopping, search and social-media platforms. They also open the door to new online ventures by the providers themselves.\n\nProviders could create fast lanes for favored services, including their own. One that could benefit, for example, is AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now, a streaming product that already is exempt from AT&T wireless data caps. The company could now also provide a fast lane for it, although there is no indication yet that it will.\n\nProponents of change, led by Mr. Pai, contend that fears over the open internet\u2019s demise have been exaggerated. They note that actual complaints of net-neutrality violations have been few and far between. Mr. Pai in particular expects public pressure\u2014aided by FCC transparency rules requiring the providers to disclose their practices in detail\u2014to prevent unreasonable behavior.\n\nMr. Pai has attempted to counter the predictions of doom by arguing that people will still be able to use the internet as they always have. He released a video recently in which he dressed up as Santa Claus and a Jedi warrior, in order to underscore that consumers will still be able to shop on the internet and follow their entertainment favorites.\n\nLarge cable and wireless firms such as Comcast, AT&T Inc. and Verizon that provide internet access to most consumers also sought to reassure consumers.\n\nAT&T executive Bob Quinn said in a statement that his company has made legally-binding net-neutrality commitments and doesn\u2019t intend to \u201cblock websites, nor censor online content, nor throttle or degrade traffic based on the content, nor unfairly discriminate in our treatment of internet traffic.... In short, the internet will continue to work tomorrow just as it always has.\u201d\n\nThose firms, however, have felt hobbled by <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2015 </span>rules, which restricted their ability to leverage their power over the internet\u2019s pipes. They also feared that the government would begin to regulate their pricing.\n\nMr. Pai has argued that the key to the new rules\u2019 success will be transparency\u2014the idea that consumers will know exactly what they are getting. For instance, a buyer of a monthly cellphone plan would be able to find out if access to a particular streaming-movie service is prioritized over other traffic from a rival service. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His plan envisions enforcement of that transparency by both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission, whose mission is consumer protection against anticompetitive and deceptive behaviors.\n\n</span>He has also criticized big internet companies that have opposed his plan, citing recent examples of their own blocking or prioritization of sites and services.\n\nA number of Democrats called on the commission to delay the vote in light of the fact that millions of comments submitted to the agency about the change have been found to be fake. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered thousands of fraudulent comments on the FCC\u2019s online commenting site. The FCC last week said it \u201cstrongly\u201d opposes the submission of fake comments, but Mr. Pai went ahead with the vote.\n\nDemocratic commissioners warned that the changes will open the online world to domination by providers, despite their claimed support for net-neutrality principles.\n\n\u201cWhen the current protections are abandoned, and the rules that have been officially in place <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2015 are</span> repealed, we will have a Cheshire cat version of net neutrality,\u201d said Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn. \u201cWe will be in a world where ... all that is left is a broadband provider\u2019s toothy grin and those oh-so-comforting words: We have every incentive to do the right thing. What they will soon have is every incentive to do their own thing.\u201d\n\nSeveral open-internet advocacy groups and other opponents of the rules said they planned to sue to overturn the new FCC order within weeks. Free Press, one such group, said it would challenge the FCC\u2019s definition of broadband, its justifications for the reversal and \u201cthe many process fouls that have plagued the FCC proceeding since it began earlier this year.\u201d\n\nFCC leaders believe the new order is legally defensible.\n\nJack Nicas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to John D.

But internet-service providers such as Comcast Corp. or Verizon Communications Inc. would be free to make all sorts of big changes, such as offering new packages with pricing schemes that deliver some kinds of content but not others. One type of service that could proliferate in the new regime is zero-rating deals, where specific websites or services are exempted from a mobile carrier\u2019s data caps.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In his official comment on Thursday, Mr. Pai, the architect of the new rules, emphasized the need to reinvigorate broadband investment in the face of huge and growing consumer demand.\n\n</span>\u201cSimply put, by returning to the light-touch [regulatory] framework, we are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have stronger incentives to build networks, especially in unserved areas, and to upgrade networks to gigabit speeds and [next-generation 5G wireless].... In short, it\u2019s a freer and more open internet.\u201d\n\nBut the issue, which has been the subject of public policy debates for more than a decade, has stirred activists who view a tightly regulated, open internet as a powerful force for democracy and opportunity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Those groups stepped up their activity ahead of the Thursday vote, arguing that the change threatens to hit consumers with higher prices and to Balkanize the internet.\n\n</span>Much of that opposition was led by major internet firms such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. They have worried for years that internet providers would use their outsize influence to extract unfair fees or promote their own content.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision from the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality is disappointing and harmful,\u201d said Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cAn open internet is critical for new ideas and economic opportunity\u2014and internet providers shouldn\u2019t be able to decide what people can see online or charge more for certain websites.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that it was \u201ccommitted to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support, have been approved by the courts, and are working well for every part of the internet economy.\u201d\n\n</span>The new rules could allow novel alliances between broadband providers and major entertainment, shopping, search and social-media platforms. They also open the door to new online ventures by the providers themselves.\n\nProviders could create fast lanes for favored services, including their own. One that could benefit, for example, is AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now, a streaming product that already is exempt from AT&T wireless data caps. The company could now also provide a fast lane for it, although there is no indication yet that it will.\n\nProponents of change, led by Mr. Pai, contend that fears over the open internet\u2019s demise have been exaggerated. They note that actual complaints of net-neutrality violations have been few and far between. Mr. Pai in particular expects public pressure\u2014aided by FCC transparency rules requiring the providers to disclose their practices in detail\u2014to prevent unreasonable behavior.\n\nMr. Pai has attempted to counter the predictions of doom by arguing that people will still be able to use the internet as they always have. He released a video recently in which he dressed up as Santa Claus and a Jedi warrior, in order to underscore that consumers will still be able to shop on the internet and follow their entertainment favorites.\n\nLarge cable and wireless firms such as Comcast, AT&T Inc. and Verizon that provide internet access to most consumers also sought to reassure consumers.\n\nAT&T executive Bob Quinn said in a statement that his company has made legally-binding net-neutrality commitments and doesn\u2019t intend to \u201cblock websites, nor censor online content, nor throttle or degrade traffic based on the content, nor unfairly discriminate in our treatment of internet traffic.... In short, the internet will continue to work tomorrow just as it always has.\u201d\n\nThose firms, however, have felt hobbled by <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2015 </span>rules, which restricted their ability to leverage their power over the internet\u2019s pipes. They also feared that the government would begin to regulate their pricing.\n\nMr. Pai has argued that the key to the new rules\u2019 success will be transparency\u2014the idea that consumers will know exactly what they are getting. For instance, a buyer of a monthly cellphone plan would be able to find out if access to a particular streaming-movie service is prioritized over other traffic from a rival service. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His plan envisions enforcement of that transparency by both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission, whose mission is consumer protection against anticompetitive and deceptive behaviors.\n\n</span>He has also criticized big internet companies that have opposed his plan, citing recent examples of their own blocking or prioritization of sites and services.\n\nA number of Democrats called on the commission to delay the vote in light of the fact that millions of comments submitted to the agency about the change have been found to be fake. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered thousands of fraudulent comments on the FCC\u2019s online commenting site. The FCC last week said it \u201cstrongly\u201d opposes the submission of fake comments, but Mr. Pai went ahead with the vote.\n\nDemocratic commissioners warned that the changes will open the online world to domination by providers, despite their claimed support for net-neutrality principles.\n\n\u201cWhen the current protections are abandoned, and the rules that have been officially in place <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2015 are</span> repealed, we will have a Cheshire cat version of net neutrality,\u201d said Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn. \u201cWe will be in a world where ... all that is left is a broadband provider\u2019s toothy grin and those oh-so-comforting words: We have every incentive to do the right thing. What they will soon have is every incentive to do their own thing.\u201d\n\nSeveral open-internet advocacy groups and other opponents of the rules said they planned to sue to overturn the new FCC order within weeks. Free Press, one such group, said it would challenge the FCC\u2019s definition of broadband, its justifications for the reversal and \u201cthe many process fouls that have plagued the FCC proceeding since it began earlier this year.\u201d\n\nFCC leaders believe the new order is legally defensible.\n\nJack Nicas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to John D.

{"id": "90411", "text": "<h3>Analysts say Trump may be overly optimistic on new North American trade deal</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">President Trump casts his new North American trade agreement as \u201cthe biggest trade deal in the United States\u2019 history\u201d \u2014 one that would return lost manufacturing jobs to American shores, discourage future outsourcing of factory work, and \u201csend cash and jobs pouring into the United States.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But many economists and trade experts say the president\u2019s forecast may prove overly optimistic, given the limited changes that are envisioned and the powerful economic forces that already have reshaped regional commerce.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While some industries and regions would fare better than others, the sheer size of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $20 trillion</span> U.S. economy will probably swamp those specific effects.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The accord, which the president has christened the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would require automobiles to include more North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment, pry open a sliver of Canada\u2019s dairy market and update trading rules for the Internet economy.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">[Trump says trade deal proves tough talk and tariffs work]\nAll that earned the administration wary praise Monday from business groups, farmers, investors and even some Democratic lawmakers.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But the president\u2019s ebullience about \u201chigh-quality American jobs\u201d ushering in \u201ca new dawn for the American auto industry\u201d stood in contrast to the relatively muted assessments of professional economists.\n</span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolutionary deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s a modification of a deal already in place,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, an investment and research firm.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe total economic impact will be very small.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">I do not expect it to boost the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">To the degree that it could drive growth, the deal would do so by removing the cloud of uncertainty that Trump has created by unsettling global trade, some economists said.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That climate of doubt may have held back investments \u2014 so the new deal could perhaps add a tenth of a percentage point to the economy\u2019s growth rate next year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n</span>\u201cWe see this rebranded NAFTA agreement as a marketing exercise,\u201d Rupkey said. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe harsh war of words from Trump\u2019s economics team terrified markets, consumers and businesses for a time, but what the U.S. actually got was much more modest than what the angry war of words seemingly demanded.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose Monday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 193 points</span>, or less <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span>, to close <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 26,651.21.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Trump celebrated the new agreement with a White House Rose Garden ceremony in which he said the deal included stronger labor protections and would make it easier for American farmers to sell to Canadian customers.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">[Canada avoids a doomsday trade scenario.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But is it a win?]\nOther provisions would refresh regional trading rules for a 21st-century economy, providing important clarity for e-commerce retailers as well as data-rich industries such as financial services.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Even some left-leaning economists gave the president credit for bettering the existing trade bargain.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019d argue this deal is an improvement, though enforcement will make or break that impression,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.\n</span>The administration will probably confront a tough fight for congressional approval next year, when the House of Representatives may be controlled by Democrats. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Touting large potential gains from a new trade deal \u2014 as President Bill Clinton did <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993 when</span> he was promoting the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 will be a central part of the White House campaign.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe all tend to overstate the impact of trade agreements,\u201d said Mickey Kantor, who led the Clinton administration\u2019s sales pitch for NAFTA, which Trump\u2019s new deal would replace.</span> \u201cYou do that for political reasons. But all we do is open ourselves up to criticism and make ourselves look bad.\u201d\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">As economists and trade analysts sorted through <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,800</span>-plus pages of the new accord, they saw few signs of major change.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Lorenzo Caliendo, an economics professor at Yale University\u2019s School of Management who co-authored a NAFTA study published <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 that</span> concluded each American had gained <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $45 a</span> year from that treaty, said the new agreement would \u201cclearly not\u201d return significant numbers of manufacturing jobs to the United States.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The limited differences between the new and old treaties, coupled with changes in the U.S. labor force over the past quarter-century, would minimize the economic benefits, Caliendo said.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Much of the work that has moved to Mexico <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1994,</span> when the original deal took effect, would be ill-suited for the higher-skilled contemporary U.S. labor force, according to Caliendo.\n</span>\u201cI expect very small aggregate effects,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n[Wonkblog: Who are the winners and losers of the \u2018new NAFTA\u2019?<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">]\nSome of the gains may be important for individual industries or farmers but may not make much of a difference in the overall economy.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The president has been especially critical of Canada\u2019s dairy management system, which limits imports to protect domestic farmers\u2019 incomes and has been a particular irritant for U.S. producers in states such as Wisconsin.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">As one of the final issues to be resolved, Canada agreed to open <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 3.5 percent</span> of its dairy market to U.S. farmers.\n</span>The auto industry would face some of the biggest adjustments, illustrating how the deal would create winners and losers. The new agreement is widely expected to raise vehicle costs and create more onerous paperwork requirements, especially for the <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 1 and</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 2 suppliers</span> that feed major automakers such as General Motors and Ford.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The Trump administration aims to return auto industry jobs to the United States.</span> To encourage that, the new deal stipulates that at <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 75 percent</span> of a vehicle \u2014 vs.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62.5 percent</span> today \u2014 must be produced in the NAFTA region to qualify for duty-free treatment. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Another new provision requires at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 40 percent</span> of each automobile to be made by workers <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning $16 an</span> hour, far higher than Mexico\u2019s average factory wage.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe new deal makes it harder to assemble a car in Mexico and export it to the United States and meet the requirements,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n</span>At the same time, he said, \u201ccarmakers are also less able to buy cheaper parts from European or Asian suppliers.\u201d\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan predicts \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of jobs could return out <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 375,000 lost</span> over the past two decades but says American consumers would see sticker prices increase <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by $470 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $2,200 per</span> vehicle.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">But while the agreement may create some additional U.S. and Canadian jobs in the short run, companies over time could look to cut costs by using more robots in their factories.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe do not anticipate an increase in U.S. auto manufacturing employment.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Rather, it will result in an advance in the use of robotics and automation in Mexico,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at audit firm RSM.\n</span>Such judgments are shared by key Democrats. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), a prominent voice on trade policy, told reporters Monday that the Trump administration has done \u201cvery little\u201d consultation with Democrats and predicted it will have trouble getting the new pact approved if Democrats retake the House.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf there\u2019s a major change here, and I think there will be, it will be very difficult to try to push through this trade agreement,\u201d Levin said.\n</span>The veteran lawmaker, a fierce NAFTA critic, also said the new regional content rules were less onerous than they appeared.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">At the moment, more <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2 million</span> vehicles a year are made in the United States and exported, including some at the BMW plant in South Carolina.</span> Another concern is that if costs rise, companies are likely to cease U.S. production and build cars intended for sale overseas in Asia or

point.\u201d\nErica Werner contributed to this report.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Analysts say Trump may be overly optimistic on new North American trade deal</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">President Trump casts his new North American trade agreement as \u201cthe biggest trade deal in the United States\u2019 history\u201d \u2014 one that would return lost manufacturing jobs to American shores, discourage future outsourcing of factory work, and \u201csend cash and jobs pouring into the United States.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But many economists and trade experts say the president\u2019s forecast may prove overly optimistic, given the limited changes that are envisioned and the powerful economic forces that already have reshaped regional commerce.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While some industries and regions would fare better than others, the sheer size of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $20 trillion</span> U.S. economy will probably swamp those specific effects.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The accord, which the president has christened the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would require automobiles to include more North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment, pry open a sliver of Canada\u2019s dairy market and update trading rules for the Internet economy.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">[Trump says trade deal proves tough talk and tariffs work]\nAll that earned the administration wary praise Monday from business groups, farmers, investors and even some Democratic lawmakers.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But the president\u2019s ebullience about \u201chigh-quality American jobs\u201d ushering in \u201ca new dawn for the American auto industry\u201d stood in contrast to the relatively muted assessments of professional economists.\n</span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolutionary deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s a modification of a deal already in place,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, an investment and research firm.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe total economic impact will be very small.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">I do not expect it to boost the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">To the degree that it could drive growth, the deal would do so by removing the cloud of uncertainty that Trump has created by unsettling global trade, some economists said.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That climate of doubt may have held back investments \u2014 so the new deal could perhaps add a tenth of a percentage point to the economy\u2019s growth rate next year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n</span>\u201cWe see this rebranded NAFTA agreement as a marketing exercise,\u201d Rupkey said. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe harsh war of words from Trump\u2019s economics team terrified markets, consumers and businesses for a time, but what the U.S. actually got was much more modest than what the angry war of words seemingly demanded.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose Monday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 193 points</span>, or less <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span>, to close <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 26,651.21.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Trump celebrated the new agreement with a White House Rose Garden ceremony in which he said the deal included stronger labor protections and would make it easier for American farmers to sell to Canadian customers.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">[Canada avoids a doomsday trade scenario.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But is it a win?]\nOther provisions would refresh regional trading rules for a 21st-century economy, providing important clarity for e-commerce retailers as well as data-rich industries such as financial services.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Even some left-leaning economists gave the president credit for bettering the existing trade bargain.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019d argue this deal is an improvement, though enforcement will make or break that impression,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.\n</span>The administration will probably confront a tough fight for congressional approval next year, when the House of Representatives may be controlled by Democrats. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Touting large potential gains from a new trade deal \u2014 as President Bill Clinton did <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993 when</span> he was promoting the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 will be a central part of the White House campaign.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe all tend to overstate the impact of trade agreements,\u201d said Mickey Kantor, who led the Clinton administration\u2019s sales pitch for NAFTA, which Trump\u2019s new deal would replace.</span> \u201cYou do that for political reasons. But all we do is open ourselves up to criticism and make ourselves look bad.\u201d\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">As economists and trade analysts sorted through <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,800</span>-plus pages of the new accord, they saw few signs of major change.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Lorenzo Caliendo, an economics professor at Yale University\u2019s School of Management who co-authored a NAFTA study published <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 that</span> concluded each American had gained <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $45 a</span> year from that treaty, said the new agreement would \u201cclearly not\u201d return significant numbers of manufacturing jobs to the United States.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The limited differences between the new and old treaties, coupled with changes in the U.S. labor force over the past quarter-century, would minimize the economic benefits, Caliendo said.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Much of the work that has moved to Mexico <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1994,</span> when the original deal took effect, would be ill-suited for the higher-skilled contemporary U.S. labor force, according to Caliendo.\n</span>\u201cI expect very small aggregate effects,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n[Wonkblog: Who are the winners and losers of the \u2018new NAFTA\u2019?<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">]\nSome of the gains may be important for individual industries or farmers but may not make much of a difference in the overall economy.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The president has been especially critical of Canada\u2019s dairy management system, which limits imports to protect domestic farmers\u2019 incomes and has been a particular irritant for U.S. producers in states such as Wisconsin.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">As one of the final issues to be resolved, Canada agreed to open <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 3.5 percent</span> of its dairy market to U.S. farmers.\n</span>The auto industry would face some of the biggest adjustments, illustrating how the deal would create winners and losers. The new agreement is widely expected to raise vehicle costs and create more onerous paperwork requirements, especially for the <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 1 and</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 2 suppliers</span> that feed major automakers such as General Motors and Ford.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The Trump administration aims to return auto industry jobs to the United States.</span> To encourage that, the new deal stipulates that at <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 75 percent</span> of a vehicle \u2014 vs.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62.5 percent</span> today \u2014 must be produced in the NAFTA region to qualify for duty-free treatment. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Another new provision requires at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 40 percent</span> of each automobile to be made by workers <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning $16 an</span> hour, far higher than Mexico\u2019s average factory wage.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe new deal makes it harder to assemble a car in Mexico and export it to the United States and meet the requirements,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n</span>At the same time, he said, \u201ccarmakers are also less able to buy cheaper parts from European or Asian suppliers.\u201d\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan predicts \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of jobs could return out <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 375,000 lost</span> over the past two decades but says American consumers would see sticker prices increase <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by $470 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $2,200 per</span> vehicle.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">But while the agreement may create some additional U.S. and Canadian jobs in the short run, companies over time could look to cut costs by using more robots in their factories.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe do not anticipate an increase in U.S. auto manufacturing employment.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Rather, it will result in an advance in the use of robotics and automation in Mexico,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at audit firm RSM.\n</span>Such judgments are shared by key Democrats. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), a prominent voice on trade policy, told reporters Monday that the Trump administration has done \u201cvery little\u201d consultation with Democrats and predicted it will have trouble getting the new pact approved if Democrats retake the House.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf there\u2019s a major change here, and I think there will be, it will be very difficult to try to push through this trade agreement,\u201d Levin said.\n</span>The veteran lawmaker, a fierce NAFTA critic, also said the new regional content rules were less onerous than they appeared.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">At the moment, more <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2 million</span> vehicles a year are made in the United States and exported, including some at the BMW plant in South Carolina.</span> Another concern is that if costs rise, companies are likely to cease U.S. production and build cars intended for sale overseas in Asia or Eastern Europe instead.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Ford and GM welcomed the deal, but automakers continue to assess the deal\u2019s impact on their business models.</span> <span id=\"38\"

regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago.

Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.\n\nCrude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha\u2014groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.\n\n</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad\u2014but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.\n\nMr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.\n\n\"If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,\" he said.\n\nAyman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.\n\nIn normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.\n\nInside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.\n\nMost of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are \"temporarily\" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.\n\n</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.\n\nMr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, \"Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>\"\n\nAlthough the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8",

regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy.

Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "90497": {"id": "90497", "text": "<h3>Listen up: You can now buy hearing aids without a prescription</h3>The government on Monday will begin allowing pharmacies and big-box stores to sell hearing aids without prescriptions, a move that is expected to shake up an industry that has long been dominated by a handful of manufacturers under a model of care that critics said raised costs and stifled innovation.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But while the shift holds the promise of improving the lives of millions of people who have untreated mild to moderate hearing loss, it also is a sweeping test of consumer-driven health care.\n</span>For first-time users, hearing aids require fine-tuning and a degree of patience as the brain becomes accustomed to processing sounds that have been muffled for years, say audiology experts.

Apple has not made any announcements, but its website points to its history of working directly with hearing aid manufacturers to operate hearing aids via smartphone apps. With hearing aids able to stream phone calls and music, the line between ear buds and hearing assist devices is getting blurred.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Amid all the buzz, cost and limited insurance coverage will continue to dampen uptake to a degree, said specialists.</span> Private Medicare Advantage plans offer limited coverage. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Only about half of states include some level of hearing aid coverage for their low-income residents through Medicaid.\n</span>Because traditional Medicare does not cover any of the costs of hearing aids or audiology services beyond a medical assessment, <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $799 set</span> \u2014 even if it is cheaper than traditional hearing aids \u2014 will still be out of reach for many consumers.\nNimet Adam, an audiologist and development director for Hearing the Call, a nonprofit cooperative of audiologists that provide hearing health care to local communities, said many of the people she works with who can\u2019t afford prescription hearing aids may also not be able to afford over-the-counter devices.\n\u201cIf it\u2019<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $500 to</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1,200,</span> that\u2019s going to be an issue for that population,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Price has historically prevented people from getting hearing aids, said Nicholas Reed, an audiologist and assistant professor in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He has done research finding that <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2011 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> despite an increase in hearing aid use among U.S. adults, there was <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 13 percent</span> decrease for those below the poverty line.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He said part of the reason hearing aids became so expensive is the history of the market.</span> When hearing aids first became regulated in the United States, they were analog devices that were difficult to program and potentially dangerous for one\u2019s hearing if done incorrectly, so it made sense to require a professional\u2019s help and implement a gatekeeper model.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">However, the market became extremely vertically integrated, he said, with manufacturers owning thousands of hearing aid dispensaries where an audiologist would exclusively offer their products.\n</span>\u201cThey built a model that essentially is like impossible for a new company to break into,\u201d he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cEssentially, we had a stagnant market.\u201d\n</span>That long-standing state of the marketplace caught the attention of Congress. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> a bipartisan law sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) directed the FDA to develop rules for over-the-counter sales.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">It took five years for FDA to finish the job.\n</span>As more people learn about over-the-counter hearing aids, they will discover a marketplace full of largely unregulated devices that look like hearing aids but are less-sophisticated sound amplifiers. They don\u2019t have to be registered as medical devices with the FDA and most of them should be avoided by people with hearing loss, said experts. Designated as \u201cpersonal sound amplification products,\u201d they do not call themselves hearing aids or make any health claims to avoid violating FDA rules. And most of them lack key features of hearing aids, such as being able to adjust to specific frequencies of sound.\n\u201cAnybody can make anything and call it a hearing booster or whatever. A lot of those are really bad, and they don\u2019t help at all. It\u2019s more noise than anything else,\u201d said Lin, at Johns Hopkins\u2019s Bloomberg School.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">After seeking to blunt over-the-counter sales for years, earning the wrath of members of Congress, the trade association representing the \u201cBig Five\u201d global hearing aid manufacturers has declared its support.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Asked why GN\u2019s Jabra entered the market with its Enhance Plus hearing aid, Calum MacDougall, Jabra\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said it makes sense to seek out new customers with mild to moderate hearing problems.\n</span>\u201cThere are millions of people in the U.S. who have untreated hearing loss,\u201d he said, \u201cand it makes sense for us to help them take their first step.\u201d\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Yet Jabra appears to be treading carefully to avoid eroding the traditional GN hearing aid market.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Even though Jabra has FDA clearance to market its Enhance Plus as a self-fitting hearing aid under the OTC rules, Jabra avoids calling it a hearing aid in its own consumer website.</span> It uses the term \u201cearbud.\u201d\nAsked to clarify, a Jabra spokesman, Claus Fonnesbech, wrote in an email: \u201cThe reason is, that in writing, and specifications, the OTC category should not be confused with traditional, prescription-grade hearing aids.\u201d\nA previous version of this article described Claus Fonnesbech as a Jabra spokeswoman.

With hearing aids able to stream phone calls and music, the line between ear buds and hearing assist devices is getting blurred.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Amid all the buzz, cost and limited insurance coverage will continue to dampen uptake to a degree, said specialists.</span> Private Medicare Advantage plans offer limited coverage. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Only about half of states include some level of hearing aid coverage for their low-income residents through Medicaid.\n</span>Because traditional Medicare does not cover any of the costs of hearing aids or audiology services beyond a medical assessment, <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $799 set</span> \u2014 even if it is cheaper than traditional hearing aids \u2014 will still be out of reach for many consumers.\nNimet Adam, an audiologist and development director for Hearing the Call, a nonprofit cooperative of audiologists that provide hearing health care to local communities, said many of the people she works with who can\u2019t afford prescription hearing aids may also not be able to afford over-the-counter devices.\n\u201cIf it\u2019<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $500 to</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1,200,</span> that\u2019s going to be an issue for that population,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Price has historically prevented people from getting hearing aids, said Nicholas Reed, an audiologist and assistant professor in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He has done research finding that <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2011 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> despite an increase in hearing aid use among U.S. adults, there was <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 13 percent</span> decrease for those below the poverty line.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He said part of the reason hearing aids became so expensive is the history of the market.</span> When hearing aids first became regulated in the United States, they were analog devices that were difficult to program and potentially dangerous for one\u2019s hearing if done incorrectly, so it made sense to require a professional\u2019s help and implement a gatekeeper model.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">However, the market became extremely vertically integrated, he said, with manufacturers owning thousands of hearing aid dispensaries where an audiologist would exclusively offer their products.\n</span>\u201cThey built a model that essentially is like impossible for a new company to break into,\u201d he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cEssentially, we had a stagnant market.\u201d\n</span>That long-standing state of the marketplace caught the attention of Congress. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> a bipartisan law sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) directed the FDA to develop rules for over-the-counter sales.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">It took five years for FDA to finish the job.\n</span>As more people learn about over-the-counter hearing aids, they will discover a marketplace full of largely unregulated devices that look like hearing aids but are less-sophisticated sound amplifiers. They don\u2019t have to be registered as medical devices with the FDA and most of them should be avoided by people with hearing loss, said experts. Designated as \u201cpersonal sound amplification products,\u201d they do not call themselves hearing aids or make any health claims to avoid violating FDA rules. And most of them lack key features of hearing aids, such as being able to adjust to specific frequencies of sound.\n\u201cAnybody can make anything and call it a hearing booster or whatever. A lot of those are really bad, and they don\u2019t help at all. It\u2019s more noise than anything else,\u201d said Lin, at Johns Hopkins\u2019s Bloomberg School.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">After seeking to blunt over-the-counter sales for years, earning the wrath of members of Congress, the trade association representing the \u201cBig Five\u201d global hearing aid manufacturers has declared its support.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Asked why GN\u2019s Jabra entered the market with its Enhance Plus hearing aid, Calum MacDougall, Jabra\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said it makes sense to seek out new customers with mild to moderate hearing problems.\n</span>\u201cThere are millions of people in the U.S. who have untreated hearing loss,\u201d he said, \u201cand it makes sense for us to help them take their first step.\u201d\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Yet Jabra appears to be treading carefully to avoid eroding the traditional GN hearing aid market.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Even though Jabra has FDA clearance to market its Enhance Plus as a self-fitting hearing aid under the OTC rules, Jabra avoids calling it a hearing aid in its own consumer website.</span> It uses the term \u201cearbud.\u201d\nAsked to clarify, a Jabra spokesman, Claus Fonnesbech, wrote in an email: \u201cThe reason is, that in writing, and specifications, the OTC category should not be confused with traditional, prescription-grade hearing aids.\u201d\nA previous version of this article described Claus Fonnesbech as a Jabra spokeswoman.

Usually, the gap between the February and June hog contracts is <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 12 cents</span>, according to analysts. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Prices typically are higher in the summer because hogs tend to eat less when temperatures are high, which keeps them from gaining as much weight and reduces supplies.\n\n</span>\"The 900-pound gorilla sitting on those [later futures] contracts is the uncertainty due to PED virus,\" said Mike Zuzolo, president of brokerage Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Atchison, Kan.\n\nSome traders and investors are cautious about placing too much emphasis on the virus. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">One factor that could offset the disease's impact on output is U.S. hog farmers are expected to expand their herds this year to take advantage of lower feed prices.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The cost of corn, typically the main ingredient in livestock feed, has slid <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 40% in</span> the past year due to a large U.S. crop.</span> This has sharply improved hog farmers' profit margins.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Farmers also are packing more pounds on their animals because feed is cheap and they can capture higher prices from meatpackers for greater weights.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\"I think PED is a real threat, but we're going to need to see an actual shortage of pigs hit the market for futures to rally any higher,\" said Craig VanDyke, an analyst with Top Third Ag Marketing, an advisory firm in Chicago.</span> \"These heavier weights can easily make up for even a 2-3% drop in hog numbers.\"\n\nEven with the industry bracing for a smaller number of available hogs, the USDA forecasts U.S. pork production will <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rise 2% in</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 23.6 billion</span> pounds, from a year earlier, citing heavier hog weights.\n\nAnalysts note that some traders have made wrong bets in the past about how much the virus would affect supplies. For instance, traders who were expecting a big impact were surprised in the early winter to see U.S. hog supplies remain on par with a year earlier. That sent hog futures to an eight-month low on Dec.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11.</span>\n\nA question looming over the pork industry is whether farmers seeking to expand their herds will have their plans snuffed out by the appearance of the virus in their barns.\n\nAs of the first week of January,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,084 separate</span> positive cases of the virus have been reported to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which tracks the disease. Each case may represent anywhere from one infected animal on a farm to thousands across a producer's operations. The U.S. has <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 68,300 hog</span> farms, according to the USDA. Furthermore, these cases have no clear correlation with the number of deaths caused by the disease.\n\nThe industry is trying to develop vaccines to thwart the PED virus, but so far none is in widespread use. Researchers are unsure how the virus, first identified in the U.K. <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1971,</span> entered the U.S.\n\nPhil Borgic, a hog farmer in Nokomis, Ill., said he has invested at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $5 million</span> in new facilities, enhanced \"biosecurity\" safeguards and new breeding animals in the past few months as he seeks to ramp up output while keeping the virus out of his herd.\n\nMr. Borgic <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent $150,000 to</span> build a station where trailers that transport his pigs to packing plants must be washed and dried.

You feel helpless.\"\n\nThough outbreaks at Hitch's farms since then have been smaller, it continues to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lose 500 to</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 600 piglets</span> a week, Mr. Brandherm said. \"We're still not back at the production levels we had prior to the disease,\" he said.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The hit to supplies is expected to contribute to higher bacon and pork-chop prices for U.S. consumers as well.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Retail pork prices likely will set a fresh record this year, breaking the nominal all-time high <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $3.81 a</span> pound reached in October, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The USDA projects <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2% to</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3% increase</span> in retail pork prices <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span></span> after a gain of <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1% last</span> year.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Mike Boero, the meat-department manager at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in Zion, Ill., says shoppers already are talking about higher bacon prices.</span> \"It's definitely gone up more than I can afford,\" he said. \"People are only buying it if it's on sale.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nWorries about the virus have pushed hog prices higher in the past few months.</span> But many traders said the impact on production likely won't show up in a significant way until spring and summer because the disease began to accelerate in October and piglets take around six months to reach slaughter weight.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That sentiment has led to a wider-than-normal disparity in the price of hogs in the front-month contract\u2014February\u2014and for contracts with later dates, according to analysts.</span> On Friday, February hog futures <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.57 cent</span>, <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 0.7%,</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 85.82 cents</span> a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Prices hit the highest levels for a front-month contract in seven weeks on <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Jan 3.</span>\n\n</span>The June contract, meanwhile, closed <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $1.009 a</span> pound, about a 15-cent premium over the February contract. Usually, the gap between the February and June hog contracts is <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 12 cents</span>, according to analysts. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Prices typically are higher in the summer because hogs tend to eat less when temperatures are high, which keeps them from gaining as much weight and reduces supplies.\n\n</span>\"The 900-pound gorilla sitting on those [later futures] contracts is the uncertainty due to PED virus,\" said Mike Zuzolo, president of brokerage Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Atchison, Kan.\n\nSome traders and investors are cautious about placing too much emphasis on the virus. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">One factor that could offset the disease's impact on output is U.S. hog farmers are expected to expand their herds this year to take advantage of lower feed prices.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The cost of corn, typically the main ingredient in livestock feed, has slid <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 40% in</span> the past year due to a large U.S. crop.</span> This has sharply improved hog farmers' profit margins.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Farmers also are packing more pounds on their animals because feed is cheap and they can capture higher prices from meatpackers for greater weights.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\"I think PED is a real threat, but we're going to need to see an actual shortage of pigs hit the market for futures to rally any higher,\" said Craig VanDyke, an analyst with Top Third Ag Marketing, an advisory firm in Chicago.</span> \"These heavier weights can easily make up for even a 2-3% drop in hog numbers.\"\n\nEven with the industry bracing for a smaller number of available hogs, the USDA forecasts U.S. pork production will <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rise 2% in</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 23.6 billion</span> pounds, from a year earlier, citing heavier hog weights.\n\nAnalysts note that some traders have made wrong bets in the past about how much the virus would affect supplies. For instance, traders who were expecting a big impact were surprised in the early winter to see U.S. hog supplies remain on par with a year earlier. That sent hog futures to an eight-month low on Dec.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11.</span>\n\nA question looming over the pork industry is whether farmers seeking to expand their herds will have their plans snuffed out by the appearance of the virus in their barns.\n\nAs of the first week of January,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,084 separate</span> positive cases of the virus have been reported to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which tracks the disease. Each case may represent anywhere from one infected animal on a farm to thousands across a producer's operations. The U.S. has <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 68,300 hog</span> farms, according to the USDA. Furthermore, these cases have no clear correlation with the number of deaths caused by the disease.\n\nThe industry is trying to develop vaccines to thwart the PED virus, but so far none is in widespread use. Researchers are unsure how the virus, first identified in the U.K. <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1971,</span> entered the U.S.\n\nPhil Borgic, a hog farmer in Nokomis, Ill., said he has invested at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $5 million</span> in new facilities, enhanced \"biosecurity\" safeguards and new breeding animals in the past few months as he seeks to ramp up output while keeping the virus out of his herd.\n\nMr. Borgic <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent $150,000 to</span> build a station where trailers that transport his pigs to packing plants must be washed and dried. Visitors to his barns must shower and put on new clothes and boots.\n\n\"We're doing whatever we can to keep it out,\" the 57-year-old said in an interview earlier this month.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Borgic said that he'd discovered infected piglets on his farm.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Rich Nelson, chief strategist with brokerage Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Ill., said he thinks prices for hogs this summer could break the record closing high <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.0745 a</span> pound set in <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 2011.</span></span> \"It appears that PED virus issues are going to beat out any herd expansion in<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span>\" Mr. Nelson said.\n\nWrite to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "60609": {"id": "60609", "text": "<h3>To Secure His Brutal Grip on Power, North Korean Leader Adopts Grandfather\u2019s Folksy Image</h3>Kim Jong Un fashions his propaganda, policies and nuclear ambitions after the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il Sung.

For around two decades, North Korea\u2019s estimated output surpassed South Korea\u2019s. Even some defectors laud his skills in hindsight.\n\nBy contrast, Kim Il Sung\u2019s son and successor, Kim Jong Il, ruled during a 1990s famine that killed more than a million people. Under a so-called military-first policy, he demanded austerity from rank-and-file citizens to make sure the armed forces had all the resources they needed.\n\nKim Jong Il cracked down on private wealth while enjoying a lavish private lifestyle. His khaki jumpsuits drew ridicule abroad. He also was a recluse, whose voice was broadcast only once during his 17-year rule.\n\nThese days, state propaganda highlight his son, Kim Jong Un, as a man of the people, just like his grandfather. A few months after he assumed power, state TV showed him bringing gifts and pouring drinks for families who had just moved into new apartments in Pyongyang. His wife washed dishes.\n\nKim Jong Un also moved away from his father\u2019s demands for austerity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Instead, he resurrected a policy of his grandfather\u2019s known as the dual-track: The state would pursue both economic growth and nuclear weapons.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Kim has thousands of soldiers building recreational and housing projects in Pyongyang, which are showcased by state-run newspapers and TV as evidence of economic advancement.\n\n</span>Alongside a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and redeveloped streets in Pyongyang, known among foreigners as \u201cLittle Dubai,\u201d are new riding stables, a water park and dolphin aquarium.

Smartphones are hot sellers, though primarily Chinese-made models that don\u2019t connect to the internet, which is largely banned. Such illegal goods as foreign movies recorded on memory cards are also sold in markets, said Sokeel Park of the group Liberty in North Korea, a nongovernmental organization that helps defectors.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Kim Kwang-Jin, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and banker, said Mr. Kim has tolerated free-market sales as a potential source of tax income.\n\n</span>The dictator\u2019s populist image is cultivated by state media accounts of Mr. Kim getting angry with officials who, for instance, give incorrect weather forecasts or let weeds sprout through the pavement of an amusement park.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s public image of warmth toward his citizens contrasts with his ruthless elimination of potential rivals, including <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 execution</span> of his uncle, whom he called \u201cfactional filth.\u201d Mr. Kim has demoted or purged more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 top</span> officials, according to South Korean government estimates.\n\nEvan Medeiros, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House National Security Council for two years from mid-2013, said U.S. officials became increasingly persuaded of Mr. Kim\u2019s potential longevity as his rule progressed.\n\n\u201cOnce the major purges took place, we thought he was solid,\u201d said Mr. Medeiros, who is now Asia head for consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather also consolidated power through purges of potential challengers <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1953,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1956,</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1967.</span> None, however, were known to rival the execution by antiaircraft fire of a North Korean defense minister under Mr. Kim, as alleged last year by South Korea\u2019s spy agency.\n\nThe recent purges appear to pave the way for Mr. Kim to reassert the authority of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, another echo of his grandfather\u2019s. The party was used by Kim Il Sung to oversee and control his citizens and government. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">His son, Kim Jong Il, ceded more authority to the military, allowing it take over lucrative businesses in mining and foreign trade.\n\n</span>This year, at the first party congress <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 36 years</span>, Mr. Kim replaced a military-dominated governing body with one made up mostly of politicians. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the shift also puts economic management back in the hands of presumably more capable technocrats.\n\n</span>While reducing the role of the military in politics, Mr. Kim has accelerated the development of weapons of mass destruction, his grandfather\u2019s dream.\n\nKim Il Sung started North Korea\u2019s nuclear program with help from the Soviet Union. After the collapse of its former patron, the former North Korean leader agreed to a deal with the U.S. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994 that</span> froze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear work for almost a decade. It later emerged that North Korea had maintained a secret program to enrich uranium, one type of fuel for an atomic bomb.\n\nThree of North Korea\u2019s five nuclear tests have been conducted under Kim Jong Un\u2019s reign, and he has more than doubled <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 16 ballistic</span> missile tests held under his father.\n\nRecent successful tests of missiles launched from a mobile carrier and a submarine show North Korea is also gaining the capacity to hit back even if its military bases are destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s failed policy has allowed us to build a full nuclear deterrent, including counterstrike ability,\u201d the senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said.\n\nU.S. officials say they have pursued all avenues to reduce the threat from North Korea. Earlier this year, U.S. officials offered talks about ending the armed standoff on the Korean Peninsula if Pyongyang would discuss scrapping its nuclear program. The idea was rejected.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, used North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a bargaining chip for aid and security guarantees. Diplomats and experts say Mr. Kim uses the nuclear program instead to enhance his standing with the military and to intimidate South Korea, with little concern for diplomatic fallout. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Even ties with China\u2014the North\u2019s economic lifeline, defender and sole major ally\u2014have been strained by Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear push.\n\n</span>Mr. Kim\u2019s unexpected resilience has forced Washington to recalculate the scale of the threat North Korea poses to the world, as well as U.S. responses.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and its allies have pledged to step up economic sanctions against North Korea.</span> The U.S. has little power to directly pressure Pyongyang because it has almost no links to the isolated regime. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Efforts are instead focused on persuading countries with economic and diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The U.S. would like to reduce North Korea\u2019s export of coal and other minerals, almost all of which are sold to China.</span> Beijing, however, is strongly resistant to any action that might destabilize North Korea and send a flood of refugees over its shared border. China also sees North Korea as a strategic buffer against U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.\n\nRecent high-level defections, including the second-in-command of Pyongyang\u2019s U.K. embassy, have raised speculation of unrest among the elite. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">South Korean officials say Mr. Kim\u2019s brutality and demand for foreign currency is causing fractures.\n\n</span>A steady diet of propaganda, meanwhile, has pressed home a message that security from nuclear arms outweighs the dangers they may bring, a point of view that is apparently bolstering Mr. Kim\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cSome people in North Korea worried about war,\u201d said Choi Sul-Kyung, a 28-year-old North Korean soldier who defected last year. \u201cBut they also thought we might win.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the September<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> print edition as 'Roots Help Kim Tighten Grip in North Korea'.", "displayed_text": "<h3>To Secure His Brutal Grip on Power, North Korean Leader Adopts Grandfather\u2019s Folksy Image</h3>Kim Jong Un fashions his propaganda, policies and nuclear ambitions after the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il Sung.

Visitors to the new zoo enter through a gate shaped like a giant tiger\u2019s mouth.\n\nAn analysis of state media reports on tours by North Korean leaders shows <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 20% of</span> Kim Jong Un\u2019s so-called guidance visits have been at leisure spots and construction projects, places where his father rarely appeared.\n\nDuring a visit\u2014billed as an inspection\u2014to the Pyongyang zoo this year, Mr. Kim said it would help visitors see North Korea\u2019s \u201cstrength and civilization.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">North Korean officials say these projects show that economic pressures from abroad are futile.</span> \u201dYou can see that sanctions on us have no effect,\u201d a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said in a recent interview.\n\nOutside the country, those claims draw skepticism. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Pyongyang releases no official economic statistics, but South Korea\u2019s central bank estimates that North Korea\u2019s economy grew around half a percentage point each year <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> driven mostly by mineral exports.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Two Western diplomats who recently traveled through rural North Korea on separate visits said clear signs of poverty remained.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Yet a loosening of economic restrictions appears to be raising living standards a bit, according to defectors and recent visitors.\n\n</span>Despite North Korea\u2019s longstanding ban on private enterprise, Mr. Kim has allowed some street markets and small businesses. Smartphones are hot sellers, though primarily Chinese-made models that don\u2019t connect to the internet, which is largely banned. Such illegal goods as foreign movies recorded on memory cards are also sold in markets, said Sokeel Park of the group Liberty in North Korea, a nongovernmental organization that helps defectors.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Kim Kwang-Jin, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and banker, said Mr. Kim has tolerated free-market sales as a potential source of tax income.\n\n</span>The dictator\u2019s populist image is cultivated by state media accounts of Mr. Kim getting angry with officials who, for instance, give incorrect weather forecasts or let weeds sprout through the pavement of an amusement park.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s public image of warmth toward his citizens contrasts with his ruthless elimination of potential rivals, including <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 execution</span> of his uncle, whom he called \u201cfactional filth.\u201d Mr. Kim has demoted or purged more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 top</span> officials, according to South Korean government estimates.\n\nEvan Medeiros, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House National Security Council for two years from mid-2013, said U.S. officials became increasingly persuaded of Mr. Kim\u2019s potential longevity as his rule progressed.\n\n\u201cOnce the major purges took place, we thought he was solid,\u201d said Mr. Medeiros, who is now Asia head for consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather also consolidated power through purges of potential challengers <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1953,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1956,</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1967.</span> None, however, were known to rival the execution by antiaircraft fire of a North Korean defense minister under Mr. Kim, as alleged last year by South Korea\u2019s spy agency.\n\nThe recent purges appear to pave the way for Mr. Kim to reassert the authority of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, another echo of his grandfather\u2019s. The party was used by Kim Il Sung to oversee and control his citizens and government. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">His son, Kim Jong Il, ceded more authority to the military, allowing it take over lucrative businesses in mining and foreign trade.\n\n</span>This year, at the first party congress <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 36 years</span>, Mr. Kim replaced a military-dominated governing body with one made up mostly of politicians. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the shift also puts economic management back in the hands of presumably more capable technocrats.\n\n</span>While reducing the role of the military in politics, Mr. Kim has accelerated the development of weapons of mass destruction, his grandfather\u2019s dream.\n\nKim Il Sung started North Korea\u2019s nuclear program with help from the Soviet Union. After the collapse of its former patron, the former North Korean leader agreed to a deal with the U.S. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994 that</span> froze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear work for almost a decade. It later emerged that North Korea had maintained a secret program to enrich uranium, one type of fuel for an atomic bomb.\n\nThree of North Korea\u2019s five nuclear tests have been conducted under Kim Jong Un\u2019s reign, and he has more than doubled <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 16 ballistic</span> missile tests held under his father.\n\nRecent successful tests of missiles launched from a mobile carrier and a submarine show North Korea is also gaining the capacity to hit back even if its military bases are destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s failed policy has allowed us to build a full nuclear deterrent, including counterstrike ability,\u201d the senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said.\n\nU.S. officials say they have pursued all avenues to reduce the threat from North Korea. Earlier this year, U.S. officials offered talks about ending the armed standoff on the Korean Peninsula if Pyongyang would discuss scrapping its nuclear program. The idea was rejected.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, used North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a bargaining chip for aid and security guarantees. Diplomats and experts say Mr. Kim uses the nuclear program instead to enhance his standing with the military and to intimidate South Korea, with little concern for diplomatic fallout. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Even ties with China\u2014the North\u2019s economic lifeline, defender and sole major ally\u2014have been strained by Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear push.\n\n</span>Mr. Kim\u2019s unexpected resilience has forced Washington to recalculate the scale of the threat North Korea poses to the world, as well as U.S. responses.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and its allies have pledged to step up economic sanctions against North Korea.</span> The U.S. has little power to directly pressure Pyongyang because it has almost no links to the isolated regime. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Efforts are instead focused on persuading countries with economic and diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The U.S. would like to reduce North Korea\u2019s export of coal and other minerals, almost all of which are sold to China.</span> Beijing, however, is strongly resistant to any action that might destabilize North Korea and send a flood of refugees over its shared border. China also sees North Korea as a strategic buffer against U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.\n\nRecent high-level defections, including the second-in-command of Pyongyang\u2019s U.K. embassy, have raised speculation of unrest among the elite. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">South Korean officials say Mr. Kim\u2019s brutality and demand for foreign currency is causing fractures.\n\n</span>A steady diet of propaganda, meanwhile, has pressed home a message that security from nuclear arms outweighs the dangers they may bring, a point of view that is apparently bolstering Mr. Kim\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cSome people in North Korea worried about war,\u201d said Choi Sul-Kyung, a 28-year-old North Korean soldier who defected last year. \u201cBut they also thought we might win.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the September<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> print edition as 'Roots Help Kim Tighten Grip in North Korea'."}, "14981": {"id": "14981", "text": "<h3>The Crypto Party Is Over</h3>On Super Bowl Sunday, a Crypto.com ad featuring billionaire NBA star LeBron James lit up millions of Americans\u2019 TVs. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you want to make history, you gotta call your own shots,\u201d Mr. James said in the 30-second spot for the popular cryptocurrency-trading platform.</span> The words that splashed across the screen as the commercial ended read \u201cFortune favors the brave.\u201d\nLast week, Crypto.com laid <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">off 5% of</span> its workforce as its chief executive officer said on Twitter that the company was making \u201cdifficult and necessary decisions.\u201d\nThe cryptocurrency industry was built in part on swagger, enthusiasm and optimism.

When the dust settles, some crypto products and companies may no longer exist.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe reality is that like stock, with crypto, everyone is a genius in a bull market,\u201d said Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire during the dot-com boom in the \u201990s and has more recently invested in a number of crypto projects.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cNow that prices are falling for both, those companies that were unnaturally sustained by easy money will go away.\u201d\n</span>The fever pitch\nBitcoin was launched as a form of electronic money <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 by</span> an anonymous creator who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Its price rose\u2014unsteadily, haphazardly, often violently and with big crashes sprinkled throughout\u2014as more people jumped in.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Numerous factors drove the rise, but crypto investors often shared a belief that the existing financial system had failed and crypto was the future.\n</span>In <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2021,</span> the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., went public with <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $85 billion</span> valuation, becoming the first major bitcoin-focused public company. It was viewed as a watershed moment for the crypto world.\nIn August, the city of Miami debuted MiamiCoin, a city-branded cryptocurrency.\nThe cryptocurrency complex pushed individual investors hard to join in. Crypto.com\u2019s spot featuring Mr. James was one of several crypto ads that ran during this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Ads for crypto companies are now splashed across Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 uniforms and several major-league and college-sports venues. Coinbase ran an ad during the NBA Finals.\nIn <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2020,</span> well-known hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones revealed that he had a small portion of his assets in bitcoin, and called it a \u201cgreat speculation.\u201d <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At the time, bitcoin was trading <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $9,000.</span></span> Other professional investors followed. Bill Miller. Alan Howard. Stanley Druckenmiller. Suddenly, crypto was OK for the mainstream, it appeared.\nLast December, the red letters spelling out \u201cStaples Center\u201d were pulled down from the famed Los Angeles venue, replaced by new signs reading \u201cCrypto.com Arena,\u201d after <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $700 million</span> naming-rights deal, believed to be the biggest in history.\nEarlier this year, more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 25,000 people</span> showed up for a Miami crypto conference, a slew of events across the city and the endless parties. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez presided over the unveiling of an 11-foot long,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,000</span>-pound, black, techno-styled bull, to rival New York\u2019s famous one on Wall Street. The centerpiece at the conference\u2019s expo hall was a giant, smoking, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 volcano. A party at the Versace mansion featured live music and synchronized swimmers.\nThe panels and speakers raved about bitcoin and its future. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor, who leveraged his business-software company and put more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100,000 bitcoins</span>, worth more <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 billion</span> at the peak, on its balance sheet, said: \u201cI am more bullish than ever on bitcoin.\u201d</span> ARK Investment CEO Cathie Wood said bitcoin would rise to more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 million</span>. PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel suggested bitcoiners should make an \u201cenemies list\u201d of people opposed to the cryptocurrency.\nAt that conference and others, \u201cyou could see this certain amount of euphoria and sense of invincibility,\u201d said Dan Gunsberg, who started investing in bitcoin <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span> today is the chief executive at crypto-based Hxro Network.

Also high on the sell list: crypto.\nSo far this year, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value and currently trades at its lowest level since <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2020.</span> Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, has fallen <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 68% so</span> far this year.\n\u201cThere was absolutely a lot of hubris across a lot of asset classes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That led to a lot of greed and unsustainable business models and a lot of leverage in crypto.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s collapsing now,\u201d said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, a crypto-focused financial-services firm.</span> \u201cA large number of crypto funds will not survive this.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Many don\u2019t appreciate the degree to which the sector\u2019s growth has been aided by a long-running bull market in stocks and the market-juicing policies of the world\u2019s central banks, said Joel Kruger, a strategist at asset exchange LMAX Digital.</span> It was the very system crypto sought to replace.\n\u201cThe irony of it all is the easy-money conditions since <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 crisis</span> have lent themselves to the greatest period of risk-taking we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Kruger said. \u201cThat benefited cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nThe fallout\nIn retrospect, Mr. Jones\u2019s \u201cgreat speculation\u201d remark may end up being the most prescient comment on bitcoin. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The braggadocio that marked so much of the crypto world is fading as those easy-money policies have been reversed and the bull market in stocks has disappeared.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The carnage has spread from the cryptocurrencies themselves to companies that provide services in the market.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">For exchanges, trading activity drives the majority of their business, and with the selloff, revenues have fallen.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Coinbase reported <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $429.7 million</span> first-quarter loss in May and said its users were fleeing the platform, even as its executives sold stock and pocketed profits.</span> In June, for the first time since its founding <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span></span></span> it laid off staff\u2014nearly one-fifth of its workforce. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Its stock now trades <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $51,</span> compared with its high <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $429.54 on</span> its first day of trading on <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 14,</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021.</span></span> Gemini, BlockFi, and big-spending Crypto.com have also let staffers go.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In early May, persistent downward pressure in the crypto market broke something big: the stablecoin terraUSD, a cryptocurrency meant to hold a <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady $1 value</span>, collapsed due to what was essentially a run on the bank, taking along with it its sister coin, Luna.</span> Almost overnight,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $40 billion</span> worth of the two cryptocurrencies were gone. That collapse has had downstream effects. Earlier in June, a large crypto-lending service called Celsius Network LLC, which had <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $12 billion</span> in user assets, froze withdrawals. The money is currently still locked up and the company has hired a law firm to try to work through its obligations and debts. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Another lender, Babel Finance, on Friday suspended withdrawals and redemptions.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital Ltd. has been considering strategic options, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, including asset sales or a rescue by another firm, after it suffered major losses.\n</span>Despite the losses, some investors remain optimistic. Marshall Johnson Jr., a 54-year-old education-television producer in Maryland, started buying bitcoin <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> when it was <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $38,000.</span> His plan at the time was to slowly put in enough money to own one full bitcoin. He still believes in bitcoin\u2019s future, and hasn\u2019t changed his plan despite the selloff and despite the fact that on paper he has lost money. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In fact, given the drop in price, he figures he\u2019ll reach his goal sooner.\n</span>\u201cI\u2019m closer than I was a year ago,\u201d he said, laughing.\nC.J. Wilson first heard of bitcoin <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> At the time, he was a Major League Baseball pitcher who lived in California and had spent his downtime buying and selling silver bars and gold coins. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">He said he viewed the digital currency with skepticism because he wasn\u2019t sure how currency could be created on a computer.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2019,</span> after he retired from MLB, however, he read the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on bitcoin and was intrigued.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">A self-described insomniac, Mr. Wilson said he began trading bitcoin in the middle of the night, and soon started dabbling in other cryptocurrencies.</span> \u201cSometimes you just look at them and think that\u2019s a cool name,\u201d he said. He attended crypto conferences all over the world, from San Francisco to London to Las Vegas.\nMr. Wilson eventually refocused his attention on bitcoin. This past year, though, he said he started noticing signs of froth. When Crypto.com sponsored the Lakers\u2019 arena, he started wondering, \u201cWhere are they getting all this money from?\u201d He said he received invitations to yacht parties from people who had made it big in crypto. He noticed Coinbase\u2019s CEO, Brian Armstrong, bought a home in California <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $133 million</span>. At the bitcoin conference in Miami this spring, he attended a glitzy party hosted by Gemini at a mansion.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo me, it makes you realize that was probably the top of the market,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Mr. Wilson said he still believes in bitcoin, but this spring he started trading bitcoin more than simply holding it.\n</span>The current flushing-out of the crypto world strikes some investors as similar to the late-1990s and internet companies. On the one hand, investors were correct during that bubble: The internet was the future. But that didn\u2019t stop many of them from losing boatloads of money as hundreds of internet companies failed.\n\u201cLong-term, we\u2019re huge believers in crypto,\u201d said Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who invests in crypto. \u201cBut short-term, watch out.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Kelly Miller,<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35,</span> was a professional musician in San Francisco. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">He watched his income go to zero as the world shut down, and started investing in stocks through Robinhood Markets Inc.</span> In <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2021 he</span> decided to try buying some crypto coins, and purchased some dogecoin. He watched his small purchase soar in value before swiftly falling back. Despite the roller coaster, Mr. Kelly, who now lives in Istanbul, said he was hooked. Over the past year and a half, he\u2019s bought bitcoin, Ethereum and solana, among others, with the most of his money in solana, he said. The latest downturn, which has hurt his portfolio, drove home to him the need for changes in the crypto world.\n\u201cThis space needs to be regulated, it needs to be safe for consumers,\u201d he said. He said he believes there\u2019s a lot of value in the underlying technology, and in NFTs in particular, but he said he\u2019s worried selloffs like this current crypto winter will erode trust among investors.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have any exposure to crypto?

Bitcoin itself has plunged <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $21,206,</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 69% off</span> its all-time high <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $67,802.30.</span> Crypto exchanges are bleeding users, crypto companies are laying off workers with at least one contemplating restructuring.\nThe crypto world is no stranger to booms and busts, which many in the industry refer to as \u201cwinters.\u201d But many investors and workers are feeling this crypto crash more acutely than previous ones. When the dust settles, some crypto products and companies may no longer exist.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe reality is that like stock, with crypto, everyone is a genius in a bull market,\u201d said Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire during the dot-com boom in the \u201990s and has more recently invested in a number of crypto projects.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cNow that prices are falling for both, those companies that were unnaturally sustained by easy money will go away.\u201d\n</span>The fever pitch\nBitcoin was launched as a form of electronic money <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 by</span> an anonymous creator who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Its price rose\u2014unsteadily, haphazardly, often violently and with big crashes sprinkled throughout\u2014as more people jumped in.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Numerous factors drove the rise, but crypto investors often shared a belief that the existing financial system had failed and crypto was the future.\n</span>In <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2021,</span> the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., went public with <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $85 billion</span> valuation, becoming the first major bitcoin-focused public company. It was viewed as a watershed moment for the crypto world.\nIn August, the city of Miami debuted MiamiCoin, a city-branded cryptocurrency.\nThe cryptocurrency complex pushed individual investors hard to join in. Crypto.com\u2019s spot featuring Mr. James was one of several crypto ads that ran during this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Ads for crypto companies are now splashed across Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 uniforms and several major-league and college-sports venues. Coinbase ran an ad during the NBA Finals.\nIn <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2020,</span> well-known hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones revealed that he had a small portion of his assets in bitcoin, and called it a \u201cgreat speculation.\u201d <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At the time, bitcoin was trading <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $9,000.</span></span> Other professional investors followed. Bill Miller. Alan Howard. Stanley Druckenmiller. Suddenly, crypto was OK for the mainstream, it appeared.\nLast December, the red letters spelling out \u201cStaples Center\u201d were pulled down from the famed Los Angeles venue, replaced by new signs reading \u201cCrypto.com Arena,\u201d after <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $700 million</span> naming-rights deal, believed to be the biggest in history.\nEarlier this year, more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 25,000 people</span> showed up for a Miami crypto conference, a slew of events across the city and the endless parties. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez presided over the unveiling of an 11-foot long,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,000</span>-pound, black, techno-styled bull, to rival New York\u2019s famous one on Wall Street. The centerpiece at the conference\u2019s expo hall was a giant, smoking, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 volcano. A party at the Versace mansion featured live music and synchronized swimmers.\nThe panels and speakers raved about bitcoin and its future. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor, who leveraged his business-software company and put more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100,000 bitcoins</span>, worth more <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 billion</span> at the peak, on its balance sheet, said: \u201cI am more bullish than ever on bitcoin.\u201d</span> ARK Investment CEO Cathie Wood said bitcoin would rise to more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 million</span>. PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel suggested bitcoiners should make an \u201cenemies list\u201d of people opposed to the cryptocurrency.\nAt that conference and others, \u201cyou could see this certain amount of euphoria and sense of invincibility,\u201d said Dan Gunsberg, who started investing in bitcoin <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span> today is the chief executive at crypto-based Hxro Network. Mr. Gunsberg said he knew the ebullience was a sign of trouble: \u201cNothing that moves that fast, that parabolic, can stay high. Gravity pulls it back to earth.\u201d\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The crash\nAs fear of inflation rages, traders and investors are dumping assets in their portfolio that they deem risky.</span> Shares of unprofitable companies have dropped swiftly, with many newly public technology companies losing more than half their value in the first half of the year. Also high on the sell list: crypto.\nSo far this year, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value and currently trades at its lowest level since <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2020.</span> Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, has fallen <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 68% so</span> far this year.\n\u201cThere was absolutely a lot of hubris across a lot of asset classes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That led to a lot of greed and unsustainable business models and a lot of leverage in crypto.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s collapsing now,\u201d said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, a crypto-focused financial-services firm.</span> \u201cA large number of crypto funds will not survive this.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Many don\u2019t appreciate the degree to which the sector\u2019s growth has been aided by a long-running bull market in stocks and the market-juicing policies of the world\u2019s central banks, said Joel Kruger, a strategist at asset exchange LMAX Digital.</span> It was the very system crypto sought to replace.\n\u201cThe irony of it all is the easy-money conditions since <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 crisis</span> have lent themselves to the greatest period of risk-taking we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Kruger said. \u201cThat benefited cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nThe fallout\nIn retrospect, Mr. Jones\u2019s \u201cgreat speculation\u201d remark may end up being the most prescient comment on bitcoin. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The braggadocio that marked so much of the crypto world is fading as those easy-money policies have been reversed and the bull market in stocks has disappeared.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The carnage has spread from the cryptocurrencies themselves to companies that provide services in the market.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">For exchanges, trading activity drives the majority of their business, and with the selloff, revenues have fallen.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Coinbase reported <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $429.7 million</span> first-quarter loss in May and said its users were fleeing the platform, even as its executives sold stock and pocketed profits.</span> In June, for the first time since its founding <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span></span></span> it laid off staff\u2014nearly one-fifth of its workforce. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Its stock now trades <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $51,</span> compared with its high <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $429.54 on</span> its first day of trading on <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 14,</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021.</span></span> Gemini, BlockFi, and big-spending Crypto.com have also let staffers go.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In early May, persistent downward pressure in the crypto market broke something big: the stablecoin terraUSD, a cryptocurrency meant to hold a <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady $1 value</span>, collapsed due to what was essentially a run on the bank, taking along with it its sister coin, Luna.</span> Almost overnight,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $40 billion</span> worth of the two cryptocurrencies were gone. That collapse has had downstream effects. Earlier in June, a large crypto-lending service called Celsius Network LLC, which had <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $12 billion</span> in user assets, froze withdrawals. The money is currently still locked up and the company has hired a law firm to try to work through its obligations and debts. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Another lender, Babel Finance, on Friday suspended withdrawals and redemptions.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital Ltd. has been considering strategic options, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, including asset sales or a rescue by another firm, after it suffered major losses.\n</span>Despite the losses, some investors remain optimistic. Marshall Johnson Jr., a 54-year-old education-television producer in Maryland, started buying bitcoin <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> when it was <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $38,000.</span> His plan at the time was to slowly put in enough money to own one full bitcoin. He still believes in bitcoin\u2019s future, and hasn\u2019t changed his plan despite the selloff and despite the fact that on paper he has lost money. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In fact, given the drop in price, he figures he\u2019ll reach his goal sooner.\n</span>\u201cI\u2019m closer than I was a year ago,\u201d he said, laughing.\nC.J. Wilson first heard of bitcoin <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> At the time, he was a Major League Baseball pitcher who lived in California and had spent his downtime buying and selling silver bars and gold coins. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">He said he viewed the digital currency with skepticism because he wasn\u2019t sure how currency could be created on a computer.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2019,</span> after he retired from MLB, however, he read the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on bitcoin and was intrigued.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">A self-described insomniac, Mr. Wilson said he began trading bitcoin in the middle of the night, and soon started dabbling in other cryptocurrencies.</span> \u201cSometimes you just look at them and think that\u2019s a cool name,\u201d he said. He attended crypto conferences all over the world, from San Francisco to London to Las Vegas.\nMr. Wilson eventually refocused his attention on bitcoin. This past year, though, he said he started noticing signs of froth. When Crypto.com sponsored the Lakers\u2019 arena, he started wondering, \u201cWhere are they getting all this money from?\u201d He said he received invitations to yacht parties from people who had made it big in crypto. He noticed Coinbase\u2019s CEO, Brian Armstrong, bought a home in California <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $133 million</span>. At the bitcoin conference in Miami this spring, he attended a glitzy party hosted by Gemini at a mansion.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo me, it makes you realize that was probably the top of the market,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Mr. Wilson said he still believes in bitcoin, but this spring he started trading bitcoin more than simply holding it.\n</span>The current flushing-out of the crypto world strikes some investors as similar to the late-1990s and internet companies. On the one hand, investors were correct during that bubble: The internet was the future. But that didn\u2019t stop many of them from losing boatloads of money as hundreds of internet companies failed.\n\u201cLong-term, we\u2019re huge believers in crypto,\u201d said Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who invests in crypto. \u201cBut short-term, watch out.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Kelly Miller,<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35,</span> was a professional musician in San Francisco. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">He watched his income go to zero as the world shut down, and started investing in stocks through Robinhood Markets Inc.</span> In <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2021 he</span> decided to try buying some crypto coins, and purchased some dogecoin. He watched his small purchase soar in value before swiftly falling back. Despite the roller coaster, Mr. Kelly, who now lives in Istanbul, said he was hooked. Over the past year and a half, he\u2019s bought bitcoin, Ethereum and solana, among others, with the most of his money in solana, he said. The latest downturn, which has hurt his portfolio, drove home to him the need for changes in the crypto world.\n\u201cThis space needs to be regulated, it needs to be safe for consumers,\u201d he said. He said he believes there\u2019s a lot of value in the underlying technology, and in NFTs in particular, but he said he\u2019s worried selloffs like this current crypto winter will erode trust among investors.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have any exposure to crypto?

It was a sign to him of just how widespread the phenomenon had gotten. \u201cI get recognized on the street? Walking around Austin?\u201d he said. \u201cThat was really surprising.\u201d\nHis fervor is driven by the idea that bitcoin solves fundamental problems with the existing system.

Hurricane Sandy, the devastating <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2012 storm</span>, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">did $19 billion</span> in damage to the city, and the pace of development along the water has only increased.\nNow, after a year in which hurricanes ravaged Houston and the Caribbean, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is substantially redrawing New York\u2019s flood maps for the first time in three decades. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">It is a painstaking process that will affect tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people, determining how and where buildings can be constructed and the cost of flood insurance on everything from modest bungalows to luxury skyscrapers.\n</span>New York will be the first major metropolis to be remapped taking into account the realities of climate change, like rising sea levels and increasingly powerful storms.\nThe new models, for coastal areas stretching from Cape May to the Hudson Valley, will be used to shape the city\u2019s future zoning, development and building standards to help it become more sustainable. As a result, FEMA and city officials say, New York could be an example for other places around the country.\nBut the maps will also be shaped by the history of New York, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">where 80 percent</span> of properties were built before the current flood maps and requirements were in place, as opposed <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span> nationally, noted J. Andrew Martin, acting chief of FEMA\u2019s risk analysis branch in New York. If those older buildings end up in high-risk zones, their owners could be required to buy flood insurance or make expensive modifications, adding costs that are beyond the reach of many working-class homeowners.<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Continue reading the main story\nThe collision of science with political and economic realities means that the battle over how many more people will fall in the flood zones will be fought house by house, block by block, with millions of dollars at stake.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a game of inches,\u201d said Elizabeth Malone, program manager of resiliency and insurance at Neighborhood Housing Services Brooklyn, a community group that counsels residents in flood-prone areas.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In New York, where more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50,000 people</span> are homeless, and where the mayor has pledged to create or <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">preserve 200,000 units</span> of affordable housing by the end <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2022,</span> the FEMA maps could add further financial strain.\n</span>The city has already pushed back against FEMA. The agency proposed preliminary maps <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 </span>\u2014 soon after Hurricane Sandy \u2014 that would have doubled both the area of flood zones and the number of people inside them. The city, in an unusual move, successfully challenged the scientific assumptions underlying the new maps.\nIn the coming weeks, formal discussions on the maps between New York City and the agency will likely begin.\nThere is no time to waste, said Mr. Martin, who has been on assignment in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. \u201cSandy may not happen again like it did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will be something very similar, and it\u2019s not that far off.\u201d\nBut the process will not be fast, and homeowners should be prepared to be in \u201climbo\u201d for years, said Daniel A. Zarrilli, the city\u2019s chief resilience officer and senior director for climate policy and programs. That may not be ideal, he said, but it is \u201cbetter than it could have been had the city not worked to protect affordability and incorporate climate risks onto the maps. We don\u2019t want to jack up insurance rates and cause a foreclosure crisis, and we want a smoother glide path to a better flood insurance program, and more accurate maps.\u201dContinue reading the main story\nAn Affordability Challenge\nThe first time FEMA mapped the city was <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1983.</span> Since then, only minor changes have been made. The agency was working on an update, as requested by the city, when Hurricane Sandy hit.\nA month later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane.\nThe audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone.\nIn the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.\n</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.\nIndeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact. One recent federal report estimated there was <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 40 percent</span> \u201cuncertainty of flood predictions.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA\u2019s proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation \u2014 the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood \u2014 by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, \u201cunnecessarily putting <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately 26,000 buildings</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 170,000 residents</span>\u201d in higher-risk locations and \u201ccausing an affordability challenge.\u201d\nIn March, at the city\u2019s request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps\u2019 potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The report found that the proposed maps could \u201creduce property values, increase loan defaults, lower tax revenue, and create hardships for current residents.</span>\u201dContinue reading the main story\nOne area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2013 proposal</span></span>, the difference for the area is stark: <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Just 26 buildings</span> were in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1983 FEMA</span> flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 5,000 buildings</span>.\nCanarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But in a neighborhood that weathered the city\u2019s highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have \u201clittle to put toward mitigating their flood risk,\u201d according to a city report released in May.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor\u2019s Office of Storm Recovery.</span> By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established.\nWith such coverage, premiums would probably be <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $500 a</span> year; without it, the annual rates could <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be $3,000.</span>\nBut <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">even $500 a</span> year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood.\nOn Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA\u2019s flood zones.

As a result, FEMA and city officials say, New York could be an example for other places around the country.\nBut the maps will also be shaped by the history of New York, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">where 80 percent</span> of properties were built before the current flood maps and requirements were in place, as opposed <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span> nationally, noted J.

That may not be ideal, he said, but it is \u201cbetter than it could have been had the city not worked to protect affordability and incorporate climate risks onto the maps.

Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane.\nThe audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone.\nIn the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.\n</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.\nIndeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact.
