{"id": "82117", "displayed_text": "<h3>Full TPP Text Reveals A Very Bad Deal for America - Breitbart</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is finally public, after years of President Obama\u2019s secret negotiations and a refusal to share the text openly with Congress and the American people.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Unsurprisingly, the document is full of special deals for various U.S. trading partners, foreign corporations, and multinational U.S. businesses.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The TPP is anything but the free trade agreement it purports to be.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The use of the term \u201cfree trade,\u201d however, is both a smokescreen to conceal what it really contains and a codeword designed in part to attract the support of Congressional Republicans who lurch zombie-like to support anything labeled free trade, without understanding or even examining the details.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The top Obama Administration trade negotiator, Michael Froman, admitted as much when he insisted the deal cannot be re-negotiated, particularly over the lax rules on importing foreign-made autos and auto parts into the United States.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Apparently, one of America\u2019s biggest economic problems is that Toyota does not sell enough cars and trucks here, and thus does not displace enough American jobs.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The TPP deal allows Toyota a special concession to keep its global supply chain intact.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">TPP lowers the already too low NAFTA parts content standard, and permits Toyota to export vehicles to the United States that contain a large percentage of parts produced in non-TPP countries.</span> And so, other Asian countries such as China, who are not even TPP partners are beneficiaries. Hard to believe, right?\nU.S. auto makers and Congressional Democrats are unhappy with the concession and want it renegotiated. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But according to Froman, \u201cHere we <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 12 countries</span>, half of whom we already have free trade agreements with, where every issue is tied to every other issue.</span> You pull the string out on one of these issues and you unravel the whole thing.\u201d Thus Froman admits that the TPP deal is shot through with favoritism and crony arrangements\u2026but it can\u2019t be altered.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">A real free-trade deal could be written on a single sheet of paper, with commitments to remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers of any kind \u2014 including the removal of Value Added Taxes (VATs) applied to American exports at the port of entry \u2014 and pledges to refrain from the currency manipulation that cheapens and subsidizes the cost of foreign exports.</span> But is the TPP one page \u2014 or even two? No, it contains thousands of pages <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 30 chapters</span>, only a few of which deal with tariff reduction.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The other chapters deal with rules and regulations for all manner of things not directly related to trade.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">For example, there are labor and environmental chapters hailed by President Obama as the \u201cmost progressive ever.\u201d\n</span>But the big problem, whether one is for or against these chapters in principal, is that the president is deceiving us. These chapters are completely unenforceable. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Are we really going to have a fleet of labor rights and environmental inspectors cruising around Vietnam, checking to make sure that every last factory is being fair to its workers and not polluting?</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Or tramping through the jungles of Malaysia to make sure that the government has put an end to the human trafficking and forced labor camps?</span> No, it\u2019s just not humanly possible.\nIncidentally, there are two major missed opportunities within the TPP. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">And these have to do with the United States not using a Value Added Tax (VAT) and not manipulating its currency.</span> Froman claims to have <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">cut 18,000 tariffs</span> in the TPP, but he has completely neglected the most significant tariff of all \u2014 foreign VAT taxation. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">All of the other TPP countries (except tiny Brunei) utilize a VAT tax system.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">This is a major trade barrier that imposes a direct tax on U.S. exports, but it is completely unaddressed in the TPP.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">As for currency manipulation, the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency and is freely traded in markets throughout the world.</span> However, a significant number of TPP countries manipulate their currencies to give their goods a competitive advantage over American products.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But in the TPP, there are only side agreements to discuss currency manipulation via reporting requirements and consultative mechanisms.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">What these side deals mean is that a country can continue to intervene in currency markets, and then the U.S. can discuss the matter \u2014 without the ability to do anything about it.</span> That is not a concession or an \u201cextremely meaningful\u201d accomplishment, as Froman has said. It is a surrender \u2014 at a time when the U.S. could have addressed the problem.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The TPP is being touted as giving a big boost to the American economy.</span> That\u2019s the rationale for doing the deal in the first place, right?\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But there is no economic study or model that shows any big net benefit to the United States.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">There is one Peterson Institute study, cited by the U.S. Trade Representative, that shows a <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">minimal 0.4 percent</span> gain for the American economy <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2025.</span></span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s hardly enough to start reducing our immense and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">growing $18 trillion</span> national debt.</span> And two U.S. Department of Agriculture studies show no net gain in agriculture from the TPP. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Why sign the agreement if it doesn\u2019t help with the national debt?</span> Two words: Special Interests.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, the TPP is a complex series of rules and regulations intended to manage the economic relations between <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 nations</span> party to the agreement.</span> And its meticulous design serves to benefit each country\u2019s \u201cnational champion\u201d companies and industries, with the big winners in the U.S. being the major Wall Street banks, insurance companies, and multinational manufacturer-outsourcers.\nOne big example of this complex hypocrisy: The TPP has, in addition <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 30 main</span> chapters, a total <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 58 side</span> agreements (called \u201cside letters.\u201d) <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">And Japan alone <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">possesses 14 of</span> these side letters, with each one laying out special conditions for Japanese participation and special deals for Japanese economic sectors.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Free trade?</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Hardly!\nRepublicans allegedly hate regulatory regimes \u2014 but apparently are okay with them if they are done on an international scale under the rubric of free trade.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">What\u2019s wrong with this picture and party?\nKevin L. Kearns is president of the U.S. Business & Industry Council (USBIC), a national business organization advocating for domestic U.S. manufacturers <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1933.</span>\n</span>Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

{"id": "1646", "displayed_text": "<h3>Live Updates: Biden Delivers a Warning to Putin Over Ukraine</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Live Updates: Biden Delivers a Warning to Putin Over Ukraine\nIn a high-stakes video call, President Biden warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of \u201cstrong economic and other measures\u201d from the U.S. and European allies if military tensions with Ukraine escalated.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">President Biden, in a high-stakes virtual meeting on Tuesday morning, warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of economic consequences if he continued to escalate a military presence around Ukraine, according to a White House statement.\n</span>The diplomatic effort came as tens of thousands of Russian troops mass along the Ukrainian border, raising fears of an invasion.\nJake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, described the president\u2019s comments to reporters.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\n</span>He later added, \u201cThere was a lot of give and take, there was no finger wagging, but the president was crystal clear about where the United States stands.\u201d\nMr. Sullivan said the administration was also prepared to send supplies and additional resources to Ukraine if Russia escalated its military presence.\nAsked for specifics for the consequences facing Russia, Mr. Sullivan declined to go into detail. \u201cI will look you in the eye and tell you as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today that things we did not do <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> we are prepared to do now,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the year Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Virtually no country has recognized the action, and Western powers continue to condemn Russia for it.\nThe U.S. and Russian leaders began their conversation via video-link at 10:07 a.m., according to the White House, and it ended at 12:08 p.m. According to the White House, they also discussed ransomware and issues related to Iran. Before the call, Biden officials said the discussion would cover nuclear arms control, cybersecurity and Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed to continue the dialogue on the issues discussed on Tuesday.\nMr. Biden would be speaking to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, on Thursday, Mr. Sullivan said.\nIn a brief video of the opening moments of the call released by Russian state television, Mr. Putin said, \u201cGreetings, Mr. President!\u201d\n\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Mr. Biden responded warmly, after what appeared to be a brief connection glitch. \u201cUnfortunately, last time we didn\u2019t get to see one another at the G20. I am hoping next time we meet we do it in person.\u201d\nThe video showed Mr. Putin seated at a long wooden desk, with Mr. Biden on a large video screen in front of him, and he waved to Mr. Biden as the call began. Mr. Putin took the call from his residence in Sochi, the Russian resort city on the Black Sea.\nAfter the call ended, Mr. Biden was expected to hold a separate call with multiple U.S. allies, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. The leaders had previously agreed to stay in contact on Russia\u2019s deployment to Ukraine, according to the White House.\nThe virtual meeting with Mr. Putin was a crucial test for Mr. Biden, as he tried to protect Ukraine, a democratic ally whose security U.S. officials have promised to defend, and head off a major European security crisis.\nMr. Putin has complained that Ukraine poses a threat to Russia through its close military and political ties to the United States and European powers.\nU.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin has not decided whether to invade Ukraine. But the United States has disclosed intelligence showing that Russia\u2019s military has developed a war plan that envisions as many <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 175,000 troops</span> pouring across Ukraine\u2019s border \u2014 an invasion force that Ukraine\u2019s military, despite U.S.-provided equipment and training, would have little ability to stop.\nDon\u2019t call it a Zoom.\nPresident Biden\u2019s talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday relied on a secure communications process about which the Biden administration has very little to say: not about conducting the call, or the full list of participants, or how the contents of the call will be memorialized.\n\u201cAs a general rule we would not talk about security measures or the logistics of the president\u2019s calls with world leaders,\u201d Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said.\nBut based on recent history \u2014 including details that emerged after a whistle-blower\u2019s revelations about former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 </span>\u2014 there are more than a few clues to piece together about the mechanics of the call.\nEach White House organizes its calls differently, according to Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a former cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, and sometimes the protocol can vary from leader to leader. But a secure call essentially means the communication between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin would be encrypted.\n\u201cA lot of other intelligence services out there would love to know what conversation actually took place between the president of the U.S. and the president of Russia,\u201d Mr. Daniel said in an interview. \u201cYou want to encrypt the bits as they\u2019re flowing\u201d from leader to leader.\nTo memorialize calls with foreign leaders, presidential administrations have relied on the so-called TNet system, a highly secure network that connects to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, a secure intranet system operated by the Defense Department. More sensitive files can be stored in an even more tightly controlled program, called NICE, for N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment: \u201cYou have a lot of control over what pieces of data that people can get to depending on their access,\u201d Mr. Daniel added.\nThe calls are organized through the National Security Council, with the council\u2019s executive secretary overseeing the logistics. Often, the president, working with the national security adviser, decides who will be present or able to listen in for the calls.\nMr. Biden\u2019s side of the call was in the Situation Room, which is historically where presidents have hosted secure calls with other world leaders. Mr. Putin\u2019s side was from his residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Tass, the state news agency.\nThe longstanding White House policy is to not record calls held in the Situation Room, according to Larry Pfeiffer, who served as a director of the Situation Room during the Obama administration. Instead, there is a transcription, which, he said, allows the White House \u201cboth a historical record that can be relied upon but allows for plausible deniability\u201d if something unflattering were to leak. (The limits of transcription were exposed in some detail two years ago, in the aftermath of accusations that aides to then President Donald J. Trump mishandled the system to store a call with the Ukrainian president.)\nMr. Biden was solo onscreen when the call started, but it is common practice to have aides on hand listening to the call. Each would have a designated role. The Situation Room is equipped with voice-to-text translation software, and a note taker relies on that software to assemble an account of what the two leaders say. In this case, several experts said, a translator would also likely be present.\nA subject-matter expert on the National Security Council is also generally present. That person looks over the material from the call, reviews and edits it based on their understanding of the foreign leader and current events, and then passes it along to the national security adviser.\nMr. Biden\u2019s advisers say that the president believes that there are benefits to meeting face-to-face and in-person with a leader like Mr. Putin. But with mounting Russian aggression toward Ukraine and the threat of an invasion hanging in the balance, Mr. Biden did not have the luxury of travel time to practice his preferred in-person approach to diplomacy. On Tuesday, the day of their call, machine-gun fire and the flash of rocket-propelled grenades were reported along Ukraine\u2019s border.\nWith Putin-Biden meeting, skirmishes break out between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists.\nThe Ukrainian military exchanged fire with Russian-backed separatists using machine guns and grenade launchers on Tuesday, the day on which President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia discussed ways to ease mounting tensions in the region.\nWhile the skirmish was not unusual, it was a reminder that even as leaders in Moscow and Washington were engaging in high-stakes diplomatic negotiations, a war that has claimed thousands of lives over the past seven years showed no signs of abating.\nA recent influx of Russian soldiers along the border with Ukraine has led to fears of a wider conflagration and the prospect that Russia might be planning an invasion of the eastern European nation.\nThe exchange of fire on Tuesday broke out at three locations along the so-called line of contact, a roughly 250-mile-long barricade of trenches and fortifications between Ukrainian soldiers and their opponents in a protracted war of attrition.\nThe Ukrainian side suffered no casualties, according to the press office of the Ukrainian armed services. It was unclear if the separatists had any losses. According to the Ukrainians, it was the separatists who fired first.\n\u201cUkrainian defenders opened fire in response,\u201d the press service said in a statement, \u201cand forced the enemy to cease fire.\u201d\nThough such violence occurs almost daily in the region, in this period of explosive tension there are fears that an errant bullet or mortar shell could be all that is needed to touch off a serious escalation. Even when fired upon, Ukrainian soldiers are under strict orders not to respond unless absolutely necessary.\n\u201cThis really annoys the soldiers, that we\u2019re not allowed to respond,\u201d said First Lt. Ivan Skuratovsky, of Ukraine\u2019s 25th Airborne Brigade, which is deployed at the front in the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka.\nSerious casualties on the front lines are uncommon these days, though a handful of Ukrainian soldiers are killed each month, usually by sniper fire. There were seven soldiers killed in September, two in October and six in November. Last week, a 22-year-old soldier named Valeriy Herovkin became the first killed in December.\nAs concern mounts over Russia\u2019s menacing massing of troops on the Ukrainian border, many analysts say that the fate of the eastern European nation matters far more to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than to the Biden administration.\nMr. Putin speaks often about the former Soviet republic\u2019s historical and ethnic ties to Russia, while President Biden has said his goal is to establish a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia.\nBut Mr. Putin, who raised similar alarms with a deployment near Ukraine this spring, has once again seized the attention of Washington. And he came to Tuesday\u2019s meeting with demands of his own, including his insistence that NATO forswear the possibility of making Ukraine a member of the alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have countered that Moscow cannot dictate the foreign policy choices of other nations.\nEven if he does not plan to invade Ukraine, Mr. Putin may be wagering that Mr. Biden\u2019s preoccupation with matters like the coronavirus pandemic and competition with China will make him inclined to strike a deal.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cSeen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin\u2019s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kyiv or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine,\u201d Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in an analysis published on Monday.\n</span>\u201cRather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin\u2019s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs,\u201d Mr. Samorukov added. For Mr. Putin, any moves by Ukrainian leaders to draw closer to the West are an affront.\nComplicating matters for Mr. Biden is European uncertainty about how to handle Mr. Putin\u2019s newest threats. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">European nations are dependent on Russia for much of their energy supplies, and their economies stand to suffer if relations with Russia deteriorate further.\n</span>The Biden administration has been negotiating with European leaders in an effort to unify around which punishments could be inflicted on Russia for any new aggression.\nThe first time that President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia encountered each other in a leader-to-leader summit, it was on a sunny day last June at an estate on Lake Geneva \u2014 and the meeting was dominated by ransomware attacks on the United States, rather than the specter of an invasion of Ukraine.\nMr. Biden had, weeks before, agreed with the characterization of Mr. Putin as a \u201ckiller.\u201d Mr. Putin denied that Russia was behind a remarkably broad breach of American corporate and government computer networks \u2014 the \u201cSolar Winds\u201d attack which was discovered a year ago, just as Mr. Biden was preparing to take office \u2014 traced to one of Russia\u2019s premier intelligence agencies.\n\u201cWe want a stable, predictable relationship,\u201d Mr. Biden said going into the summit, an acknowledgment that the heady days of the 1990s, when there was talk of Russia joining Europe (and maybe, eventually, even NATO) were gone forever, and that the best that could be hoped for was good communications.\nThe Geneva meeting was tense. \u201cI did what I came to do,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden said after the meeting, including laying out a series of warnings and red lines for the Russian leader, which he insisted were not \u201cthreats.\u201d \u201cI think the last thing he wants now is a Cold War.\u201d\nMr. Putin called Mr. Biden \u201cconstructive, well-balanced and experienced,\u201d and said he wanted agreements on \u201crules of behavior\u201d on sensitive subjects like nuclear weapons and cybersecurity \u2014 an echo of American officials\u2019 hopes of finding \u201cguardrails\u201d for the U.S.-Russian relationship.\nMr. Biden emerged offering some modest optimism that the United States, by restoring its alliances in Europe, had made Mr. Putin more cautious about any actions regarded as being against Western interests.\nFor a few months it looked like something was getting done. Led by Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, talks began on \u201cstrategic stability,\u201d the diplomatic code words for managing the nuclear arsenal \u2014 and, increasingly, space and cyberweapons \u2014 in ways that do not lead to accidental war or unnecessary military escalation. Another set of conversations, quiet and private, took place between Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and her Russian counterpart. Ransomware attacks continued, the F.B.I. reported, but nothing that seemed threatening to critical infrastructure.\nBut in October and November, just as the administration was promoting modest progress, satellite photographs began to appear on desks around Washington showing a major buildup of forces around Ukraine. The administration sent William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former American ambassador to Russia, to send a warning.\nApparently, the message didn\u2019t get through.\nAVDIIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 Machine-gun fire broke the stillness just <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 8 p</span>.m. when Capt. Denis Branitskii was midway through the evening patrol. The shots came in sporadic bursts and were close by, fired by Russian-backed separatists whose positions were obscured in the darkness. Only when the flash of a rocket-propelled grenade illuminated the newly fallen snow did Captain Branitskii break his stride, briefly pausing to take cover before moving on.\n\u201cThis happens every night,\u201d said Captain Branitskii, a cleft-chinned company commander with the Ukrainian military\u2019s 25th Airborne Brigade, positioned along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s much heavier, sometimes it\u2019s like tonight. Tonight, this is fine.\u201d\nThis is the scene on the front lines right now, ahead of a phone call on Tuesday between President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at staving off a far more serious military escalation. After eight years of war, few in Ukraine believe the call will lead to an immediate breakthrough that might spare their country further violence.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a breakthrough,\u201d said Dmitry Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cPutin will hear very clear signals from President Biden about what Ukraine\u2019s partners will do if Putin comes head with a military operation against our country.\u201d\nMr. Kuleba said that following the call, Mr. Biden would speak with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nSo far, soldiers on the front lines said they had seen little evidence of escalation beyond a largely slow-moving war of attrition that set in after both sides fought to a stalemate over territory seized by Russian-backed forces <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014.</span> Compared with the vicious fighting that preceded it, this is a holiday, several soldiers said.\nOn Monday, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Ukrainian armed forces, Mr. Zelensky donned a helmet and flak jacket and visited the troops on the front lines. He later announced that Ukraine\u2019s frontline brigades would soon be getting new weapons systems including modernized tanks and armored personnel carriers. He also announced that Ukraine had signed a deal with Britain to build a new fleet of gunboats and purchase new anti-mine ships.\nThe Ukrainian military has made significant progress <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014,</span> when it nearly disintegrated in the face of a lightning operation by Russian forces to seize territory, first by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then by fomenting a separatist takeover in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nUkrainian troops have since fought alongside NATO forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and trained with American military advisors.\nBut few believe that Ukraine\u2019s military could hold out for long against a full-on Russian invasion. Some military analysts have said that, at most, Ukraine would at best manage an organized retreat.\nIf a full-on attack comes, Ukrainian forces are as ready to face it as they\u2019ve ever been, said Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, commander of the Joint Forces Operation battling the separatists. But even this, he acknowledged, would not be enough to hold off the Russian military without significant assistance from Western countries, specifically the United States.\n\u201cThis is a beast who has tasted blood,\u201d General Pavlyuk said. \u201cBelieve me, the losses are going to be horrible on both sides \u2014 thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. On their side and ours.\u201d\nAs vice president during the Obama administration, Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the lead role in managing America\u2019s relationship with Ukraine as it fended off Russian aggression.\nNow, as president, Mr. Biden is making a dramatic effort to rescue the country from the gravest threat it has faced in decades, by trying to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia not to mount the invasion that U.S. officials say he is planning.\nPresident Barack Obama gave Mr. Biden the Ukraine portfolio in his second term, after Ukraine\u2019s Russia-backed president was ousted in a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2014 popular</span> revolution. Mr. Putin considers the pro-Western leadership that came in at that time both an affront and a security threat.\nIn the following years, Mr. Biden visited Ukraine a half-dozen times, forging relationships with politicians and activists. After Mr. Putin annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and fomented rebellion in the country\u2019s east, Mr. Biden declared \u201cthe unwavering support of the United States of America and the American people\u201d for Ukraine.\n\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of freedom-loving people the world over are with you because so much rides on your fragile experiment with democracy succeeding,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2015 speech</span> to Ukraine\u2019s Parliament.\n\u201cI was the point man for our administration on the crisis, which was exactly where I wanted to be,\u201d Mr. Biden later wrote in a memoir. He scoffed at critics who predicted that Ukraine would amount to a defeat for the West at Mr. Putin\u2019s hands, one that would haunt him politically. \u201cI didn\u2019t much care. There was an important principle at stake: Big countries ought not to beat up smaller ones,\u201d he wrote.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s engagement did bring a political cost: It would expose him to political attacks \u2014 frequently in exaggerated and distorted terms \u2014 by Donald J. Trump and his allies over his son Hunter\u2019s lucrative work for a Ukrainian energy company.\n</span>At times as vice president, Mr. Biden pressed Mr. Obama \u2014 who was reluctant to be drawn into mutual escalation with Mr. Putin in Russia\u2019s back yard \u2014 to provide Ukraine with more support, like anti-tank Javelin missiles.\nBut in the memoir, Mr. Biden also recalls agreeing with Mr. Obama that there was only so much the United States could promise to a country whose importance to America is hard to distill.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe president and I agreed that we could and should convince our European allies to support and extend serious economic sanctions against Russia.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But economic sanctions were as far as the United States and its allies in Europe would go,\u201d he wrote.\n</span>Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s videoconference, the Kremlin has been signaling one core conviction: Russia cares more about Ukraine\u2019s fate than the West ever will.\nIn speeches, interviews and lengthy articles, President Vladimir V. Putin and his close associates have telegraphed a singular fixation in recent months on the former Soviet republic. The Kremlin thesis goes that Ukrainians are \u201cone people\u201d with Russians, living in a failing state controlled by Western forces determined to divide and conquer the post-Soviet world.\nUkrainians, who ousted a Russia-friendly president <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 and</span> are increasingly in favor of binding their country to Western institutions, would largely beg to differ. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Putin\u2019s conviction finds a receptive ear among many Russians, who see themselves as linked intimately with Ukraine by generations of linguistic, cultural, economic, political and family ties.</span> Now, with a force <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 175,000 Russian</span> troops poised to be in position near Ukraine by early next year, in what Western officials fear could be a prelude to an invasion, centuries of shared history loom large.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Putin\u2019s gambit may be a cold calculus of coercion \u2014 a way to force President Biden to recognize a Russian sphere of interest in Eastern Europe.</span> But to Mr. Putin, and many other Russians, the nearly eight-year-old conflict with Ukraine is not simply about geopolitics; it is about a hurt national psyche, a historical injustice to be set right. A former Kremlin adviser, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, describes the Kremlin\u2019s view of Ukraine as a \u201ctrauma wrapped in a trauma\u201d \u2014 the dissolution of the Soviet Union coupled with the separation of a nation Russians viewed as an extension of their own.\n\u201cOne of the colossal problems pushing us into conflict is that Russian identity does not exist without Ukrainian identity,\u201d said Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Parliament who was the only lawmaker to vote against the Crimea annexation and later fled to Ukraine.\nWhile other conflicts in the post-Soviet world have pitted one ethnic group against another, the one between Russia and Ukraine is more complicated. Ukrainian is Ukraine\u2019s official language, but Russian \u2014 which is closely related \u2014 is still widely spoken. Russians often view Kyiv, now the Ukrainian capital and once the center of the medieval Kyivan Rus, as the birthplace of their nation. Russian-language writers like Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov came from Ukraine, as did the Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, now speaks Ukrainian in public but first gained fame as a Russian-language comedian who performed across the former Soviet Union.\nTo many Ukrainians, Mr. Putin\u2019s appeal to a shared history is little but a hollow attempt to appropriate the country\u2019s own heritage and justify territorial ambitions.\n\u201cThey stole our past,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a pro-Western think tank in Kyiv. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to steal our future.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">With the large Russian troop buildup on the borders of Ukraine, White House, NATO and European leaders have been working to project a united front to deter the Kremlin and convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that there would be a heavy price to pay in the event of war.\n</span>On the eve of his virtual summit with Mr. Putin, President Biden spoke with allied leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain.\n\u201cThe leaders discussed their shared concern about the Russian military buildup on Ukraine\u2019s borders and Russia\u2019s increasingly harsh rhetoric,\u201d according to a readout from the White House. They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions, the statement said, and agreed that diplomacy was the only way forward.\nEven as the leaders issued assurances of solidarity, many European officials are worried that Mr. Putin could respond to pressure by diminishing gas supplies to Europe as winter approaches.\nThe crisis also comes as Germany is changing leadership and France is facing an election, creating a shifting landscape that the White House fears the Kremlin might move to exploit.\nAt the Pentagon on Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III convened top military and civilian officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the head of the military\u2019s European Command, to discuss the Russian troop buildup.\nOfficials said that there was an effort underway to send additional defensive weapons, including anti-tank Javelins, to Ukraine, but that they may be kept in position outside the country to avoid giving Mr. Putin a pretext for military action.\nSome NATO country officials have counseled against such a move, suggesting that it would not make much difference in the outcome if an invasion should come and could provoke Mr. Putin, rather than deter him.\nGiven the risks involved, some analysts, like Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argue that Mr. Putin is seeking diplomatic leverage and that the main aim of his troop buildup is not to conquer Ukraine but to get a satisfactory response from the United States.\n\u201cPutin is clearly frustrated about being ignored by Washington,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. He noted that Mr. Putin\u2019s earlier troop buildup near Ukraine secured him an early summit meeting with Mr. Biden in June. \u201cThis time it will bring Biden to a dialogue on Ukraine and other security issues in Europe.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trenin said the use of force could not be ruled out.\nJohn F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, declined to say whether the United States still had a small number of military advisers in Ukraine or whether the administration had decided to send additional military assistance there.\nThe Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that \u201ca major war in Ukraine would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In an open letter to the Atlantic Council, he said that among other major concerns for European society, a war could result in \u201cbetween three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion\u201d and could seriously disrupt food imports, including of grain, \u201ccreating a whole range of food security problems for the entire continent.\u201d\n</span>\u201cRussia\u2019s attack would also mark a definitive end to the rules-based international order, opening the door to a new era of global insecurity that would threaten decades of unprecedented peace throughout most of Europe,\u201d he wrote.\nWith Donald J.

Hovnanian American Mortgage, the mortgage arm of builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">With growing interest from these formerly delinquent buyers, K. Hovnanian provides its sales staff with a flier with industry guidelines listing the mortgage-eligibility rules for all types of derogatory events, from foreclosure to bankruptcy filings.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"The industry is saying, 'Pay your dues and then get back into the market,' \" Mr. Klinger says.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Using the three-year benchmark it takes to get an FHA-guaranteed loan, in this year's second quarter there <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were 729,000 households</span> that were foreclosed upon during the bust that are now eligible to apply for an FHA mortgage, up <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 285,000 in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> according to an analysis of foreclosure data by Moody's Analytics.</span> The company projects that number will grow <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.5 million</span> by the first quarter <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2014.</span>\n\nTypical boomerang buyers are people like April Del Rosario, who purchased her first home <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 when</span> she <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 24 years</span> old. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Newly married and unsure of what terms such as adjustable-rate mortgage meant, Ms. Del Rosario and her husband <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paid $315,000 for</span> a two-bedroom condominium in San Diego's Mission Valley area, a location they picked because it was central to their jobs.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $2,600 monthly</span> mortgage payment was already a struggle, but when the mortgage rate was adjusted higher and Ms. Del Rosario became pregnant, the couple was overwhelmed.</span> They lost the home to foreclosure <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span>\n\n\"We were really young and stupid,\" she says. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\"All of a sudden, our already really expensive mortgage was going to go up.</span> I was pregnant and everything was just bad timing on our part.<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nThree years later, the couple is back in the market.</span> The Del Rosarios were recently approved for a loan for <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $280,000 home</span> in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, which, when it is completed in January, will have three bedrooms and a two-car garage.

We just want to have a nice place for our son,\" she says.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">There is a web of rules for when and how people who have lost homes to foreclosure or short sales or have gone through a bankruptcy can become eligible for a new mortgage.</span> It typically takes three years after a foreclosure or short sale for a buyer to qualify for an FHA-backed loan. In many cases, it takes just one year after a <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</span> discharge, according to the agency.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac require a wait period of as much as seven years after a foreclosure or short sale before a consumer can become eligible for a conventional mortgage, though some short sellers can purchase again after as little as two years.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Becoming eligible for a new mortgage doesn't mean that buyers will necessarily qualify for one.</span> Lenders still require borrowers to have strong credit score and to have been paying their other bills on time.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Until recently, many of the people who had lost their home to foreclosure or short sale have rented homes, leaving many economists and industry watchers to wonder if the nation would become more of a renter society.</span> In the second quarter, the national home-ownership rate came in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 65.5%,</span> down <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 65.9% a</span> year earlier <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 69.2% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2004.</span> Each percentage-point decline represents about one million households.\n\nBut as rental rates continue rising\u2014they <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 0.8% in</span> the third quarter to a national average <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1,090 per</span> month, according to Reis Inc.\u2014homeownership is increasingly becoming cheaper than renting.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That is part of what enticed Ronda Martinez,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 39,</span> back in to the market.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2007,</span> she and her husband, Mark, let their two-story,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $430,000 home</span> in Perris, Calif., go into foreclosure when they were unable to sell it when required to move to Phoenix for a job.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Later, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010,</span> she was laid off from her job at a real-estate-data company.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Since then, the family has repaired their finances, and Mrs. Martinez found a new job.</span> This month, the family is closing on <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $150,000 home</span> in Phoenix that has five bedrooms and a pool in the back.\n\n\"Initially people are upset and think, 'I'll never buy again,' \" she said.

He denounced the GOP vote as \"pointless\" and declared the impasse to be back at \"<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Square 1.</span>\"\n\nThe White House said that if the House bill reached President Barack Obama, who championed the health law, he would veto it.\n\nThe stare-down between the two chambers intensified as Democratic aides said Mr. Reid had no plans to call the Senate into session before its planned Monday afternoon return. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That will be just hours before government funding for many federal functions runs out with the end of the fiscal year.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The next step is unclear, as no official business on Capitol Hill is planned for Sunday.</span> There was no sign negotiations were being scheduled among congressional leaders, and no lawmakers\u2014from graybeards to backbenchers\u2014said they were optimistic that a shutdown would be averted.\n\nIn a blunt acknowledgment of that prospect, the House early Sunday also approved legislation to ensure that military personnel would be paid in the event of a shutdown.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Republicans have been determined to use the budget deadline as leverage in their long-running battle to undercut the health care law, which reaches a landmark moment on Tuesday, when one of its most important components takes effect.</span> On that day, people can begin to sign up for health insurance policies through new online marketplaces.\n\n\"The American people don't want a government shutdown, and they don't want Obamacare,\" House Republican leaders said in a joint statement about their government-funding bill. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown.</span>\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll panic and do the right thing for once,\" Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) said of the Senate. \"Republicans are extremely unified at this point.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) was under pressure from conservative House members to carry the fight against the health law as long as possible.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"Pushing until the very, very last minute has been one of the mainstays of the House GOP's negotiating strategy on budget issues,\" said Stan Collender a former aide to the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a budget specialist at Qorvis Communications.</span> If House Republicans eventually accede to a simple funding bill, shorn of changes to the new health law, it won't likely be until the 11th hour on Monday, he said.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Some Republicans held hope that the Senate would agree at least to repeal the medical devices tax, giving the House GOP a victory.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">In votes earlier this year, senators from both parties backed a repeal, but Democrats were unlikely to do so as part of the current budget fight.\n\n</span>Democrats criticized House Republican leaders for moving to pass measures so close to the deadline that were bound to fail in the Senate. The longest-serving member of the House, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) had particularly harsh words.\n\n\"This once-deliberative body has been taken over by knaves and know-nothings, content with putting partisan politics ahead of the American people,'' Mr. Dingell said.\n\nHe added: \"I believe that this current Congress would be incapable of passing the Ten Commandments or even the Lord's Prayer, and today's actions have only further galvanized that belief.\"\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Some 800,000 of</span> more than two million federal workers were furloughed in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1995 shutdown</span>, with fewer workers affected in a following shutdown that stretched into <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 1996.</span> The number who would be furloughed this time is unclear and would vary by agency. The Pentagon has said <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 400,000 civilian</span> defense workers would be sent home.\n\nPostal and air traffic control services would continue, and Social Security checks would be mailed. But many federal functions would be suspended, such as surveillance of flu and other diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National parks and museums would close.\n\nSome Republicans said that the bill taken up by the House on Saturday night was unlikely to break the stalemate. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In the Senate, Democratic leaders can strike the health care delay and medical device tax amendments with a 51-vote majority, then send the funding bill back to the House.\n\n</span>Lawmakers weren't sure what Mr. Boehner's next step would be in that case.\n\nThe House could pass the Senate's funding measure, stripped of provisions related to the health law, and send it to Mr. Obama, as the Senate has insisted. Lawmakers could also buy more time by passing a short extension of funding, perhaps for a week.\n\nBut Republicans said they might take another stab at amending the spending bill and dare the Senate to let the government shut down. At the same time, some of the GOP caucus's more centrist members worried about the rapidly shrinking window of time. \"I hope it works, but it may not,'' said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.).\n\nThe House bill emerged midday from an uncommon Saturday meeting of the House Republican Conference, where GOP leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers agreed on the details of their bill.\n\nMany House Republicans say their party would likely bear more of the public blame if the government is forced into a partial shutdown. But some argued Saturday that wasn't a reason to shift course.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Republicans said they believed that economic benefits flowing from a repeal of the medical-device tax would offset the loss of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $29 billion</span> in revenue <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 10 years</span>, the sum that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the tax will generate.\n\n</span>And some Republicans argued that their proposal to delay the health-care law by one year represented a compromise between their earlier push to defund the law and Democrats' desire to keep it unchanged.\n\n\"Just delay this thing for one year\u2014it's really not too much to ask,\" said Rep. Trey Radel (R., Fla.).\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, saw little compromise in the House Republican plan. \"It's their way or the highway, and the highway leads over the cliff,\" said Rep. Sandy Levin (D., Mich.).\n\nIn the vote to delay the health law, two Republicans broke from their party to oppose a delay. They were New York Reps. Chris Gibson and Richard Hanna.\n\nTwo Democrats voted in favor of the one-year delay: Reps. Jim Matheson (D., Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D., N.C.).\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats are opposed to delaying the health law but have indicated they would entertain changes to improve the bill. But they have firmly opposed talking about even modest changes as part of negotiating the government funding bill.\n\nWrite to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific [articles focused on a single business]": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 13m 55s "}}

Sixty-seven percent had gotten at least one dose as of <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 3,</span> which remains shy of President Biden\u2019s goal <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 70 percent</span> \u2014 a crucial benchmark toward reaching herd immunity \u2014 by the Fourth of July.\n\n\u201cOur company, like the country at large, has seen a bit of a slowdown in the number of people actually getting the vaccine,\u201d Roger Krone, chairman and chief executive of Leidos, told The Post. \u201cWe see a huge need to gently push people who are on the fence, and give them one more reason to do it.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Though Leidos has been spared from the widespread outbreaks seen in the grocery, meatpacking and other industries, the company said it has lost eight employees to the pandemic.</span> One of them, Keith Redding, was among the first to die of the virus in the D.C. area. A company foundation in his name has <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $1.8 million</span> to the families of other coronavirus victims.\n\nBut as companies like Leidos prepare for a full return to in-person work, managers are working to guard their factory floors and office hallways against becoming points of transmission for a virus that has killed more <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 604,000 Americans</span>.\n\nThe fast-moving delta variant, which poses special risk to unvaccinated people, has upped the ante. The nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has called it the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to ending the U.S. pandemic. The delta variant also moved the Biden administration to activate \u201csurge response\u201d teams that will deploy additional expertise and supplies to hot spots.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has confirmed that federal law, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, does not preclude companies from making vaccinations mandatory in the workforce.</span> Some companies have done so, occasionally stirring controversy.\n\nOther are opting for the carrot over the stick. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Retail and grocery chains including Trader Joe\u2019s, Aldi and Dollar General have used various incentives to encourage vaccinations.</span> In most cases, the incentives add up to a few hundred dollars or a day off.\n\nComing off a profitable year, executives from <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $14.5 billion</span> company wanted to craft an incentive program that would make more of a splash. Krone and other executives said they chose a lottery after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), announced that he would offer <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">five $1 million</span> prizes to vaccinated state residents, along with four-year college scholarships for five vaccinated Ohioans younger <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 18.</span>\n\nFive days after its rollout, the Ohio Department of Health announced the Vax-a-Million campaign had driven <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 28 percent</span> increase in the vaccination rates of <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">residents 16 and</span> older. Other states have also gone the lottery route, including Maryland, Oregon and California.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Leidos\u2019s lottery will award each employee the equivalent of one year of salary.</span> Because managers are excluded from the sweepstakes, the company estimates its outlay will be <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1 million</span>\n\nThe company announced the initiative last Monday, along with a call for sign-ups, and has already enrolled more than a third of its workforce. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Employees are not required to show proof of vaccination when they sign up.\n\n</span>Those with a legitimate reason to opt out of the vaccine, such as a medical condition, can still enter the sweepstakes without getting inoculated, an executive said. But <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 winners</span> will be required to show a vaccine card before receiving their lump-sum payment.\n\n\u201cIn the end, in a time of crisis, what people are about is providing safety, health and security for their family,\u201d Krone said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to celebrate our first few winners.\u201d", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Good": "0"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting better": "0"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 4s "}}
