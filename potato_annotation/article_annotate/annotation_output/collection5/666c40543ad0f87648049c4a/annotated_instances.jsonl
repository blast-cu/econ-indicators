The European Union is pushing ahead with its version (the \u201cDigital Green Certificate\u201d), Israel is struggling to implement its \u201cGreen Passport,\u201d and Japan and China are deploying their own certificates.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">It also follows a year in which advice from experts on testing, mask-wearing, social distancing, economic lockdowns and vaccines turned into tests of partisan loyalties, with Republicans largely echoing Donald Trump\u2019s public doubts about whether such steps were needed.</span> (Resistance to the vaccine today runs high among his supporters, and he only recently disclosed he\u2019d had the shot and encouraged them to follow suit.)\nVaccine passports are the logical next political battleground.\nOn Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a prominent supporter of the former president, decreed the Sunshine State\u2019s borders closed to the idea.\n\u201cWe are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.\u201d\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Proponents say the certificates would provide peace of mind for employees at businesses like restaurants or bars and reassure everyone from air travelers to concert goers.\n</span>An administration official, who requested anonymity to detail behind-the-scenes deliberations, said any passport roll-out was \u201cweeks away.\u201d\nConcerns about the passports seem to run along two broad paths: Fears government will collect too much data on Americans, use it for purposes other than verifying vaccine status, and fail to safeguard the information \u2014 and worries underprivileged Americans who can\u2019t get access to the vaccine will now effectively be punished for it.\nAmericans who don\u2019t want to get vaccinated at all are obviously unlikely to embrace the certificates, either.\nMy colleague Paige Winfield Cunningham reports in The Health 202:\n\u201cTo make passports widely usable, officials would need to create standards for the type of information they must maintain, convince issuers and holders to use the same app or set of apps and figure out how to provide a paper-based system for those who don\u2019t have cellphones. Those are a lot of logistical challenges that would need to be undertaken in a short period of time.\u201d\nThe Biden administration has moved to address some worries while trying to avoid steps that might inflame vaccine skepticism.\n\u201cThere will be no centralized, universal federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki promised Monday at her daily briefing.\n\u201cUnlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cWe view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do.\u201d\nAs for equity, my colleagues Dan Diamond, Lena H. Sun and Isaac Stanley-Becker reported this weekend:\n\u201cThe passports are expected to be free and available through applications for smartphones, which could display a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass. Americans without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, developers have said.\u201d\nAs <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2019,</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 1 in</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 Americans</span> did not have a smartphone.\n\u201cWe'll leverage our resources to ensure that all vaccination credential systems meet key standards, whether that's universal accessibility, affordability, availability \u2014 both digitally and on paper,\u201d Psaki said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important that we recognize that there are still many, many millions and millions of Americans that have not yet been vaccinated,\u201d said Slavitt. \u201cSo that\u2019s a fundamental equity issue.\u201d\nSlavitt also acknowledged the possibility that Americans hesitant to get vaccinated might become more so.\n\u201cWe do know that there is a segment of the population that is concerned that the government will play too heavy-handed of a role in monitoring their vaccinations and that mandates will be coming from the federal government and important \u2014 in point of fact, it would discourage people to feel like that was the role we're playing,\u201d he said.\nWhat\u2019s happening now\nThe murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin continued this morning with recollections from Donald Williams, a key witness. Williams can be heard on video of George Floyd\u2019s death encouraging the officer to get off Floyd, Holly Bailey, Timothy Bella, Kim Bellware and Lateshia Beachum report. Williams testified that he could see Floyd \u201cgoing through tremendous pain.\u201d Williams said he felt like Floyd\u2019s life was very much in danger before he died and that he was scared for his own safety.\nQuote of the day\n\u201cThe more that his knee was on his neck \u2026 the more you see Floyd fade away, slowly fade away,\" said Williams, who is considered a relevant witness because of the vantage point he had standing in proximity to Floyd and Chauvin.\nTo start your day with a full political briefing, sign up for our Power Up newsletter.\nLunchtime reads from The Post\n- \u201cA Black Lives Matter activist exposed the role two local police officers played in the Capitol insurrection.

This small group \u2014 <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">this 10 percent</span> who make up primary voters in both parties \u2014 encourages extremism and gridlock rather than bipartisan cooperation, the report argues. \u2026 Unite America is more than an organization that puts out reports, however. \u2026 <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Kathryn Murdoch, a philanthropist with deep financial resources as the daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, donated <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $6 million</span> to the group <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 alone</span>.\u201d\n</span>- \u201cThe antiscience movement is escalating, going global and killing thousands,\u201d by Scientific American\u2019s Peter Hotez: \u201cFacilitating the spread of COVID-19 is an expanded and globalizing antiscience movement that began modestly under a health freedom banner adopted by the Republican Tea Party in Texas. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Thousands of deaths have so far resulted from antiscience, and this may only be the beginning as we are now seeing the impact on vaccine refusal across the U.S., Europe and the low- and middle-income countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\u201d\n</span>The <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 100 days</span>\nBiden will today sign bipartisan legislation extending the Paycheck Protection Program.\n- \u201cThe bill that Biden plans to sign in the Oval Office will extend the program through <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 30.</span> It is currently set to expire on <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 31,</span>\u201d John Wagner reports.\n- An NPR-Marist poll found that Americans have given Biden better marks on his handling of the coronavirus than his handling of immigration. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Sixty percent approve of his job on the coronavirus, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">while 34 percent</span> approve of his job on immigration.</span> The poll comes as a growing number of Americans are getting vaccinated and thousands of migrants are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, Wagner notes.\n- Satisfaction with the U.S. vaccine rollout surged <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 68 percent</span>, according to a new Gallup poll, doubling since January. \u201cWith more than a million Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines every day, the public's overall willingness to be inoculated against the disease has edged up three points.

Appeals Court. Meanwhile, Tiffany P. Cunningham, a patent attorney in Chicago, was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a D.C.-based lawyer, was named to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n- The list also includes candidates that, if confirmed, would become the first Muslim American to serve on a District Court, the first Asian American woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit, and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge in Maryland.\n- While Republicans will likely oppose some of the nominees, they all face easy confirmations if the Democratic caucus stays united. Our colleagues reported last month that the administration is following Trump\u2019s practice to speed up the process by forgoing the American Bar Association review of candidates in advance of formal nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee could hold hearings on the nominations by late April.\nBiden won\u2019t throw the first pitch at the Nationals stadium this Opening Day.\n- The D.C. baseball team invited Biden to Opening Day moments after the presidential race was called <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span> Today, the team said that Biden would not be coming to the stadium on Thursday but that he was welcome to throw out a first pitch sometime in the future, John Wagner and Chelsea Janes report.\n- \u201cDating back to President William Howard Taft <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1910,</span> every U.S. president had thrown out a first pitch at some point in their presidency during years that Washington had a professional baseball team. That tradition ended with Trump,\u201d our colleagues note.\nThe future of the GOP\nRepublicans, in a private call, acknowledged that Democrats\u2019 expansive electoral reform bill is popular across the political spectrum.\n- \u201cIn private, they concede their own polling shows that no message they can devise effectively counters the argument that billionaires should be prevented from buying elections,\u201d writes the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer. \u201cA recording obtained by The New Yorker of a private conference call on January 8th, between a policy adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell and the leaders of several prominent conservative groups \u2014 including one run by the Koch brothers\u2019 network \u2014 reveals the participants\u2019 worry that the proposed election reforms garner wide support not just from liberals but from conservative voters, too.\u201d\n- \u201cThe participants conceded that the bill, which would stem the flow of dark money from such political donors as the billionaire oil magnate Charles Koch, was so popular that it wasn\u2019t worth trying to mount a public-advocacy campaign to shift opinion. Instead, a senior Koch operative said that opponents would be better off ignoring the will of American voters and trying to kill the bill in Congress.\u201d\nFlorida Republicans are considering a new election bill that would ban giving voters water <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 150 feet</span> of polling places.\n- \u201cState law currently prohibits offering voters assistance <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 100 feet</span> of polling locations,\u201d NBC News reports. The new bill \u201cproposes expanding that zone <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 150 feet</span> and includes a prohibition on giving \u2018any item\u2019 to voters or \u2018interacting or attempting to interact\u2019 with voters within that zone.\u201d\n- The Florida bill would also \u201crequire voters to request mail ballots more frequently, add more identification requirements for mail voting, and limit how drop boxes are used.\u201d\n- \u201cThe [Florida] proposal is similar to a measure in Georgia\u2019s sweeping new election law that bans giving water, food or gifts to voters waiting in line, among many other restrictions.\" The Georgia measure mainly targets third-party activities, since poll workers can still set up self-serve coolers for voters.\nCorporations are very vocal about racial justice. Voting rights, not so much.\n- \u201cLast week, as Georgia Republicans rushed to pass a sweeping law restricting voter access, Atlanta\u2019s biggest corporations, including Delta, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, declined to weigh in, offering only broad support for voting rights. The muted response \u2014 coming from companies that last year promised to support social justice \u2014 infuriated activists, who are now calling for boycotts,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s David Gelles reports.\n- \u201cCompanies have effectively squashed bills at the state level before. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> when lawmakers were advancing the bathroom bills, major corporations said they would move jobs out of states that adopted such measures,\u201d Gelles notes.</span> \u201cThis time around, however, the entertainment industry has taken a more guarded approach. \u2026 The fight in Georgia is likely a preview of things to come. Lawmakers in dozens of states have proposed similar voting bills, and activists are planning to ramp up the pressure on corporate America as the battle over voting rights goes national.\u201d\nThe Freedom Caucus is fretting over how far to push its rebellion.\n- \u201cA notable split has emerged inside the House Freedom Caucus in recent weeks over its members' use of delaying tactics on the floor to protest Democratic policies. That effort has grabbed attention and ruffled leadership, two hallmarks of the Freedom Caucus, but it's also snarled legislative proceedings enough to breed frustration among some members of the far-right crew,\u201d Politico\u2019s Olivia Beavers and Melanie Zanona report.\n- \u201cSome in the caucus criticize the legislative slowdown, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and several others, as a failure to act strategically. Conservatives should challenge a select few bills rather than a wide swath, these Republicans argue, to avoid diluting the potency of moments when they choose to tie the House in procedural knots \u2026 But other Freedom Caucus members feel strongly that wreaking havoc on the floor is part of their brand and they need to deploy every procedural weapon at their disposal.\u201d\nToday in history\nPresident Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt on this day <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1981.</span> \u201cIn the 70th day of his presidency, Reagan underwent three hours of surgery at George Washington University Hospital to remove the bullet that entered under his left armpit, struck his seventh rib and burrowed three iches into his left lung,\" reported The Post's David S. Broder. \"On his way into surgery, the president gamely reassured friends: 'Don't worry about me.

Police also found an array of weapons and gear in Miller\u2019s house, prosecutors said, including a grappling hook, ropes, body armor, night vision goggles, a crossbow and arrows, and multiple firearms with ammunition. \u2026 He also sent a selfie [during the attack] that showed him standing inside the Capitol Rotunda, according to court records, with the caption: \u2018Just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol.\u2019\u201d\nHot on the right\nTrump came after Tony Fauci and Deborah Birx after they both criticized his management of the pandemic response. Birx, who ran Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force, told CNN a few days ago that she was \u201cmarginalized every day,\u201d Diamond reports. \u201cThe majority of the people in the White House did not take this seriously,\u201d she said. Fauci, meanwhile, lamented the \u201clost opportunity\u201d when Trump chose to get vaccinated in private. In a lengthy, rambling statement, Trump called both doctors \u201ctwo self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations, which I fortunately almost always overturned.\u201d\nVaccination rates per county, visualized\nThe first nationwide look at vaccination across counties reveals vast differences in the rate that people are receiving protection from the coronavirus, with notably lower rates in predominantly Black areas and counties that voted most heavily for President Donald Trump <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span> Search where your county stands in this interactive map.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Today in Washington\nBiden will sign the extension of the Paycheck Protection Program today <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2 p</span>.m.

Sitting in a building in Southwest Washington, three prosecutors assigned to his case opened with a lecture.\nFor more than two months, they had been chasing tantalizing leads offered by Corsi, an associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone who had told them that the longtime GOP operative sought a back channel to WikiLeaks during <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span>.\nThey had dispatched FBI agents around the country to interview potential witnesses, expending valuable government money and precious time \u2014 only to find themselves unable to untangle Corsi\u2019s assertions that Stone knew in advance that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\n\u201cNo lies, hunches, wishes,\u201d prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky lectured Corsi that day as they sat in a windowless conference room, according to notes taken by Corsi\u2019s lawyer, David Gray. \u201cHopes do not equal facts. Don\u2019t tell us what you think we want to hear.\u201d\nThe Yale-educated former Supreme Court clerk pleaded with Corsi: It was \u201cvitally important\u201d that Corsi provide the \u201ctruth only,\u201d Zelinsky said.\nThe trio of top prosecutors had spent weeks coaxing, cajoling and admonishing the conspiracy theorist as they pressed him to stick to facts and not reconstruct stories. At times, they had debated the nature of memory itself.\nOnce again that day, however, Corsi struggled to answer clearly questions about Stone and WikiLeaks \u2014 closing the door on an exhausting final chapter of Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year hunt to determine whether anyone in Trump\u2019s world had coordinated with Russia.\nThe investigation took the special counsel\u2019s team down several meandering paths, propelled by discoveries of unusual interactions between Trump associates and Russians. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had shared internal information with an employee assessed by the FBI to have Russian intelligence ties.</span> Foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was tipped off that the Russians had thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails. Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who he hoped would offer damaging information about Clinton.\n[Mueller\u2019s report paints a portrait of a campaign intrigued by Russian overtures]\nIn the end, Mueller\u2019s final report, a redacted version of which was released by Attorney General William P. Barr on Thursday, laid out new details about the Russian effort to influence <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span> through social media and the hacking of Democratic emails, and it offered a rich portrait of Trump\u2019s efforts as president to undermine the investigation and mislead the public.\nThe 448-page report also revealed the outcome of the long endeavor to determine the relationship between Trump associates and Russia: some unanswered mysteries, a lot of dead ends and, ultimately, a conclusion that the contacts they found did not establish a criminal conspiracy.\nStone has not been charged with serving as a conduit to WikiLeaks, which disseminated material stolen by Russians.\nInstead, he was indicted in January for lying to Congress about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and has vehemently denied having any knowledge of what WikiLeaks held and the group\u2019s exact plans. Stone has also denounced Corsi\u2019s account as lies.\nCorsi announced in November that he had rejected a deal to plead guilty to false statements and accused the special counsel\u2019s office of trying to bully him into lying. He has not been charged with any crime.\nA reconstruction of the laborious effort by Mueller\u2019s team to determine whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia shows why it was often a maddeningly difficult task.\nTheir witnesses were not ideal. A few key players, prosecutors would contend, lied in interviews. Many were loyal to the president and echoed his rhetoric that Mueller\u2019s team was acting in bad faith. Some used encrypted applications with disappearing messages that could not be reviewed. Others were overseas, unreachable to American investigators.\nIn some cases, their statements were only loosely tethered to the facts.\nThis account is based on interviews with people who interacted with Mueller\u2019s team, court documents and new details laid out in the special counsel\u2019s report. A spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\nIt was the first item in the order that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein issued in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2017 when</span> he appointed Mueller as special counsel.\nAs part of his charge, Mueller would take over a preexisting FBI investigation into \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\u201d\nThe inquiry had begun in late <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>after</span> the Australian government contacted the FBI about Papadopoulos. Over drinks at a bar in London, the young Trump aide had confided to an Australian diplomat that the Russian government had thousands of Clinton emails that could damage her candidacy.\nBy the time Mueller was appointed, the FBI had interviewed Papadopoulos and, according to him, tried unsuccessfully to get him to travel to London and surreptitiously record a conversation with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who told him about the Clinton emails. In <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 interview</span> with a British newspaper, Mifsud denied knowledge of the emails.\nThe FBI had also obtained a secret court order allowing them to monitor the communications of former Trump adviser Carter Page, who had traveled to Moscow during the heat of the campaign and interacted there with a Russian government official.\nThe work came against the backdrop of the publication of a research dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Clinton\u2019s campaign, which claimed that Trump had engaged in a knowing conspiracy with Russia, which Trump dismissed as false.\nThe special counsel moved quickly on several fronts.\nWeeks after Mueller was appointed, the FBI sent a search warrant to Google, scooping up Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s Gmail messages dating back to <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span></span> court records show. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His emails began to help investigators uncover the extent of his efforts to develop a Trump Tower project in Moscow \u2014 an attempt that persisted through much of the campaign, even as Trump publicly denied he had business ties in Russia, court filings show.\n</span>[\u2018We will be in Moscow\u2019: The story of Trump\u2019s 30-year quest to expand his brand to Russia]\nBy July, Mueller\u2019s team was delving into Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting the previous summer with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, which had also been attended by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort.\nThey started with a potentially neutral witness: the interpreter, interviewing him just four days after the New York Times broke the news of the meeting, according to the report.\nRussian-born Anatoli Samochornov described to investigators what unfolded in the 20-minute meeting: Veselnitskaya raised the topic of Democratic donors who she alleged had broken Russian law. One of her associates then brought up a U.S. sanctions law against Russia and a ban on American adoptions of Russian children that the Kremlin had imposed in retaliation. Trump Jr. said there was little his father could do to address the issue, but said it could be revisited if Trump were elected.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017,</span> prosecutors interviewed Ike Kaveladze, an employee of Aras Agalarov, the Russian billionaire who had hosted Trump\u2019s Miss Universe pageant <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 in</span> Moscow and requested the meeting through his son.\n</span>\u201cThey asked very targeted questions,\u201d said Kaveladze, who had attended the meeting as the Agalarov representative. \u201cI realized they had significant knowledge of the topic.\u201d\nMueller\u2019s team interviewed everyone who attended the meeting except Veselnitskaya, who is in Russia, and Trump Jr., who declined to participate voluntarily, they wrote. (It is unclear whether prosecutors attempted to subpoena the president\u2019s son.)\nThe picture that was emerging was one of a campaign that was eager for Russia\u2019s help at the same time the Kremlin had been working to elect Trump.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">As 2017 stretched</span> on, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador during the transition.

Emails show Manafort tried to get a message to Deripaska to offer him private briefings about Trump\u2019s effort. Manafort told investigators he never gave Deripaska such briefings.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Manafort\u2019s liaison to the Russian aluminum magnate was his own longtime Russian employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI had assessed had ties to Russian intelligence, according to the special counsel.\n</span>The report said Manafort also provided campaign polling data to Kilimnik, described to him a strategy to win the election for Trump by contesting traditionally Democratic-leaning Midwestern states and discussed with him a pro-Russian peace plan for Ukraine, a top foreign policy goal of the Kremlin. Manafort would later say he understood Trump\u2019s sign-off, if elected, would be necessary to advance the plan.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Manafort\u2019s cooperation meant prosecutors finally had a firsthand witness who could explain whether there was ever a suggestion of a trade-off: Russian assistance in the campaign in exchange for a Trump administration that supported pro-Russian policies.\n</span>On Sept.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span></span></span></span> Manafort sat for the first <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 11 interviews</span> with investigators. He also appeared twice before the grand jury.\nBut, prosecutors alleged, he did not tell them everything he knew. A federal judge agreed, ruling in February that Manafort had lied intentionally to prosecutors, particularly about his interactions with Kilimnik.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of requiring the Office of Special Counsel to pull teeth \u2014 withholding facts if he can get away with it,\u201d U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during a February hearing.\nIn an email to The Washington Post last week, Kilimnik denied he had Russian intelligence ties and said he had not shared the polling information with anyone else. He said he had \u201cabsolutely . . . zero\u201d to do with Russian interference.\nMeanwhile, several prosecutors on Mueller\u2019s team were pursuing another intriguing subject: Stone, a decades-old friend of Trump who had worked briefly for the celebrity mogul\u2019s campaign <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span> then continued to informally advise him.\n[Trump\u2019s night-owl calls to Roger Stone <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>draw</span> scrutiny in Mueller probe]\nDuring the campaign, Stone egged on WikiLeaks as the London-based group leaked materials prosecutors say were provided by Russian operatives to help elect Trump.

But it led to suspicions by Podesta and others that Stone had been aware of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans in advance.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">For months, Mueller\u2019s team sought to understand whether Stone shared information about WikiLeaks\u2019 activities with the campaign, uncovering numerous examples of Trump\u2019s deep interest in the Clinton emails.\n</span>At one point, during a drive to LaGuardia Airport, Trump told senior campaign official Gates that \u201cmore releases of damaging information would be coming,\u201d Gates later told prosecutors.\nSome in Trump\u2019s orbit appeared to view Stone as having a hand in WikiLeaks\u2019 activities.

He said that he never discussed WikiLeaks with Trump and that his claims during the campaign were just boasts and exaggerations.\nLikewise, in written answers prepared by his attorneys, Trump told prosecutors he did \u201cnot recall discussing WikiLeaks\u201d with Stone or being aware of Stone discussing the subject with others on his campaign, according to the report.\nIn <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2017,</span> Stone testified to the House Intelligence Committee that his public hints about WikiLeaks were based on vague tips he\u2019d been given by a New York City radio host and comedian named Randy Credico, whom he described as an \u201cintermediary\u201d and \u201cmutual friend\u201d of Assange.\nCredico has denied serving as a back channel for Stone.

He claimed that he had told Stone during the campaign that trying to contact Assange was a bad idea that could subject them both to investigation, according to a draft court filing.\nThat wasn\u2019t accurate.\nBy then, prosecutors had obtained emails showing that Corsi was in constant conversation with his friends and contacts, including Stone, throughout the final months of the campaign, speculating about Assange\u2019s next moves, according to Gray.\nOn July<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 25,</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>\u2014 a few days after WikiLeaks upset the Democratic National Convention by publishing internal Democratic Party emails \u2014 Stone emailed Corsi and asked him to get to Assange and find out what else the WikiLeaks founder held, according to a draft plea agreement Corsi released.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Corsi forwarded Stone\u2019s note to Ted Malloch, an American author living in London who hoped to land a job with Trump and was eager to curry favor with his campaign, according to the draft filing.\n</span>According to the report, Malloch told prosecutors he never tried to reach Assange, who was living at the Ecuadoran Embassy. He declined to comment.\nEight days later, Corsi sent Stone an email hinting he had managed to pick up new intelligence on Assange: \u201cWord is friend in embassy <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">plans 2 more</span> dumps.\u201d He predicted one of WikiLeaks\u2019 publications would come in October and referenced Podesta, according to the draft filing: \u201cTime to let more than Podesta to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC.\u201d\n[Corsi provided early alert to Stone about WikiLeaks release, according to draft special counsel document]\nCorsi has said he was never in direct or indirect contact with Assange. He said he was exaggerating his knowledge to Stone.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced my memory is correct that I didn\u2019t have a source that connected me to Assange,\u201d he told The Post in November. \u201cI really don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nBut prosecutors used his initial assertion that he declined Stone\u2019s request to seek information from WikiLeaks as a cudgel, saying he could be charged with a crime for lying, Corsi described in a book he wrote about the experience called \u201cSilent No More\u201d that was published in December.\nThey pressed him to explain: Did he ever reach Assange? Did he tell Stone in advance that WikiLeaks had Podesta\u2019s emails? Did he and Stone help WikiLeaks time the releases for maximum impact?\nGray said that he believed Corsi was trying to be honest, but he acknowledged his client\u2019s answers were not always clear or consistent.\nHe said he decided to share details from Corsi\u2019s sessions with prosecutors \u2014 including reading to The Post from contemporaneous notes \u2014 to try to help the public better understand how the clash between the special counsel\u2019s office and witnesses like Corsi frustrated and extended the investigation.\nCorsi, he noted, had sold thousands of books and built a fan base by cherry-picking facts to craft a desired narrative. For Corsi, this wasn\u2019t lying, but salesmanship, picking \u201ctruthful facts woven in a way that you don\u2019t have to worry about the things that are inconsistent,\u201d Gray said.\nThe deeply fact-based prosecutors struggled to make sense of the conspiracy theorist and his evolving testimony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their biggest nightmare,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe supposed best of the best were just frankly dumbfounded by the whole situation.\u201d\nOver sessions in September and October, Corsi offered information that appeared enticing but sketchy.\nCorsi claimed he had figured out on his own in early August<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>that WikiLeaks had Podesta\u2019s emails.

(Podesta, after all, did not work for the DNC, and his emails were not kept on the party committee\u2019s servers.)\nOver and over, they asked Corsi who had told him WikiLeaks held Podesta\u2019s emails and whether he\u2019d communicated with Assange. At one meeting, Gray said Corsi seemed to concede another person might have \u201cplanted a seed\u201d in his mind about what WikiLeaks held. Then he said that \u201cmaybe he heard it from somewhere,\u201d Gray said.\n\u201cHis answer had morphed a bit. It was concerning to me, and it was concerning to the prosecutors,\u201d he said.\nIn his book, Corsi insisted the prosecutors confused and rattled him with their repetitive questioning. At one point, he said he told the trio: \u201cIt frustrates me that I can\u2019t remember . . . Sometimes I can\u2019t tell if I remembered or invented.\u2019\u201d\nCorsi told The Post in an interview last week: \u201cI did not go in to lie or deceive them.\u201d\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cI told them from the beginning that I couldn\u2019t remember my<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>conversations with the kind of precision they were going to demand,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not a human tape recorder.\u201d\n</span>The group spent long hours in a windowless conference room, with the three prosecutors and half a dozen FBI agents arrayed on one side of the table and Gray and Corsi on the other.\nAt one point, Gray recalled that his eyes wandered to a whiteboard that covered one wall of the room. It appeared to have been only recently erased from an earlier meeting, and he could just barely make out what had been written there previously:\n\u201cUkraine\u201d it said faintly, underlined three times, an apparent reference to Manafort\u2019s interviews, which were underway during that period. Beneath that were dollar figures tallying into the tens of millions.\nAmong Corsi\u2019s claims to prosecutors, according to Corsi\u2019s book: that Stone had given him advance notice on Oct.<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7,</span></span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> that The Post would be publishing a video in which Trump could be heard coarsely bragging about groping women.\nCorsi said Stone had urged him to reach Assange and get him to release whatever he\u2019d been holding back to counter the damaging video.\nAbout a half-hour after The Post published a story about the video, WikiLeaks did, in fact, post the first tranche of thousands of Podesta emails.\nIf there was evidence that Stone played a role in the timing of the Podesta release, it would support the case that there was a conspiracy.\nStone has denied knowing anything about the tape in advance or playing a role in the timing of the Podesta release.\nCorsi also told investigators that he believed he had played a role in getting WikiLeaks to release the Podesta emails \u2014 though he offered conflicting accounts about how he might have done so, according to the report.\nLooking for corroborating evidence, with Corsi\u2019s help, prosecutors constructed a detailed timeline of Corsi\u2019s emails and phone calls in that period. They sought out Corsi\u2019s contacts, looking for anyone who could be a go-between to WikiLeaks.\nOn Oct.<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span></span></span></span> an FBI agent accompanied by a local sheriff\u2019s deputy knocked on the back gate of the home of James and Joanne Moriarty in the Piney Woods, a rural region of eastern Texas.\nThe couple had lived in Libya before <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2011 fall</span> of ruler Moammar Gaddafi and had served as sources for Corsi as he worked on articles about what he felt were the failures of the Obama administration in that country.\nIn the days leading up to the Oct.<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7,</span></span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> WikiLeaks release, they communicated several times with Corsi about an article he was writing for the right-wing online outlet World Net Daily, James Moriarty told The Post.\nMoriarty said he and his wife greeted the FBI agent coldly, first complaining that they did not see the agent as \u201cany kind of good person\u201d because he had come to their home wearing a weapon under his suit jacket.\nMoriarty said they then spent three hours telling the agent about their experience in Libya, where he said they were detained by militants, and how they believed they had been relentlessly targeted by the U.S. government since they returned to Texas.\n\u201cThe invasion of terrorists into the United States is real and present,\u201d Moriarty said. \u201cI told him about this and I told him that, now that he knows, he has to pass it along to other government agencies, including the White House, or he will be guilty of felonious acts.\u201d\nMoriarty said he and his wife ultimately consented to be interviewed. The agent spoke to them separately for a total of <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 minutes</span></span>. They both told the agent they had not connected Corsi to Assange.\nThe dead end in the Piney Woods was typical.\nAccording to Mueller\u2019s report, investigators could find \u201clittle corroboration\u201d for Corsi\u2019s claim that Stone had urged him to help spur the Podesta email release.\nIn one interview, Corsi suggested he might have publicly tweeted a message that he thought Assange would read.\n\u201cOur Office was unable to find evidence of any such tweets,\u201d Mueller wrote.\nGray said the frustration of the prosecution team became obvious. At one meeting, Rhee, a former partner at the prominent law firm WilmerHale, began to raise her voice as Corsi insisted he clearly remembered a conversation he had with Malloch a few months earlier, but not a key conversation he had shortly afterward with Stone.\n\u201cThat was six months ago,\u201d she said, according to Gray\u2019s notes.\n\u201cWe find what you\u2019re saying is lacking,\u201d Zelinsky added.\nBy their final meeting on Nov.<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span></span></span></span> the prosecutors made their concerns clear. They lectured Corsi for <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 minutes</span></span> about the need to stick to definite facts.\nThen they started in again: Were you a source about WikiLeaks for Roger Stone?\nCorsi, who had grown increasingly uncomfortable as the prosecutors spoke, had trouble answering clearly.\nAfter about five minutes, the prosecutors declared they were done, Gray said.\nBy the end, Mueller\u2019s team had uncovered a wide array of contacts between Trump\u2019s orbit and Russia \u2014 contradicting post-election claims from Trump\u2019s representatives that there had been none.\nThey did not find a crime to charge.\nAccording to the report, prosecutors concluded that Page had formed relationships with Russian intelligence officials before the campaign and that he may have been targeted in<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>by Russian officials because of his Trump campaign tie.

They also said they could find no connections between the meeting and other Russian efforts to interfere in the election.\nInvestigators struggled to determine the motive of Manafort\u2019s contacts with Kilimnik, interactions that went \u201cvery much to the heart\u201d of the special investigation, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in a court hearing in February.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">[How Manafort\u2019s<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 </span></span></span>meeting with a Russian employee at New York cigar club goes to \u2018the heart\u2019 of Mueller\u2019s probe]\nThey were hampered by not only his lies, according to the report, but his use of encrypted messaging apps.</span> Mueller ultimately did not find sufficient evidence to prove that Manafort or any other Trump associate acted as an agent of the Russian government.\nStone is scheduled to go on trial in November for lying to Congress, obstructing an official proceeding and witness tampering over allegations he attempted to intimidate Credico.\nKey details about his case were redacted from the report because of a gag order imposed by the judge, which has also limited what Stone can say in his defense. He is, however, selling T-shirts to fund his legal defense that read, \u201cRoger Stone did nothing wrong!\u201d\nIt is not clear why Mueller\u2019s team did not file the false-statement charges they threatened against Corsi. Much of the report dealing with their interactions with him has also been redacted by the attorney general, citing possible harm to an ongoing investigation. The report does not specify whether the redactions are related to Stone\u2019s case or other continuing matters.\nCorsi said last week that the experience showed the probe was a \u201cfraud from the start.\u201d He said only a \u201ccriminal\u201d would urge him to plead guilty to charges that could not be proved in court.\nGray said he believes it would be inappropriate to charge Corsi because he has a faulty memory and noted that prosecutors gave him extensive opportunities to amend their answers.\n\u201cThey pushed and pushed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, they threw up their hands and said, \u2018We can\u2019t use any of this.\u2019 \u201d\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}

Officials on both sides have said that their counterparts seemed uninterested in concessions. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The dispute has hit China\u2019s stock markets and currency while largely sparing U.S. markets.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Now, trade analysts said, U.S. plans to move ahead in coming weeks with penalties <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $200 billion</span></span></span> more in Chinese goods are raising the stakes.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe talks are necessary to avoid a complete rupture of China-U.S. relations, although the chance of coming to an agreement is low,\u201d said Mei Xinyu, an analyst at a think tank under China\u2019s Commerce Ministry and a frequent critic of U.S. trade policy.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The August discussions will be held at a lower level than previous efforts, which were helmed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The talks\u2014to be led by Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass and Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen\u2014are meant to be exploratory, providing a way for both sides to save face should progress prove elusive, said people briefed on the discussions.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Chinese side will also be represented by Finance Vice Minister Liao Min, who is a top aide to Vice Premier Liu He, and Chinese Commerce Ministry Deputy Director Zhao Na.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The U.S. Treasury has been refining its demands for Beijing, those people said, including lowering tariffs, ending policies that press U.S. firms to transfer technology to Chinese partners and improving market access for foreign companies to reduce what the U.S. calculates is <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $375 billion</span> trade imbalance in China\u2019s favor last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Another item on the U.S. agenda, the people say, is persuading Beijing to raise the value of its currency to its pre-dispute level.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The U.S. has complained for years that Beijing manipulates the yuan\u2019s value to help boost its exports.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The currency has fallen <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 10% against</span> the greenback since April, though it briefly rose <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 0.5% Thursday</span> after the news of the coming talks.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s central bank has attributed the yuan\u2019s weakness to market reaction to a strengthening U.S. dollar.\n\n</span>Largely as a result of the falling yuan, Mr. Trump ordered that the prospective tariffs <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $200 billion</span></span></span> in Chinese goods be raised to as high <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25% from</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10% so</span> Beijing can\u2019t use devaluation to limit the tariff\u2019s sting.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">U.S. officials have said that in previous talks their Chinese counterparts showed little imagination in addressing American complaints about unfair trade practices.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Chinese officials, meanwhile, have privately said the U.S. demands are too wide-ranging and are ultimately aimed at getting Beijing to dismantle its government-supported economic system.\n\n</span>Divisions within the U.S. government are likely to loom over the coming talks.\n\nSome analysts add that the Chinese side is likely to be wary of promises made by U.S. officials that aren\u2019t directly endorsed by Mr. Trump. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Messrs.

Hovnanian American Mortgage, the mortgage arm of builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">With growing interest from these formerly delinquent buyers, K. Hovnanian provides its sales staff with a flier with industry guidelines listing the mortgage-eligibility rules for all types of derogatory events, from foreclosure to bankruptcy filings.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"The industry is saying, 'Pay your dues and then get back into the market,' \" Mr. Klinger says.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Using the three-year benchmark it takes to get an FHA-guaranteed loan, in this year's second quarter there <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were 729,000 households</span> that were foreclosed upon during the bust that are now eligible to apply for an FHA mortgage, up <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 285,000 in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> according to an analysis of foreclosure data by Moody's Analytics.</span> The company projects that number will grow <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.5 million</span> by the first quarter <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2014.</span>\n\nTypical boomerang buyers are people like April Del Rosario, who purchased her first home <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 when</span> she <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 24 years</span> old. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Newly married and unsure of what terms such as adjustable-rate mortgage meant, Ms. Del Rosario and her husband <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paid $315,000 for</span> a two-bedroom condominium in San Diego's Mission Valley area, a location they picked because it was central to their jobs.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $2,600 monthly</span> mortgage payment was already a struggle, but when the mortgage rate was adjusted higher and Ms. Del Rosario became pregnant, the couple was overwhelmed.</span> They lost the home to foreclosure <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span>\n\n\"We were really young and stupid,\" she says. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\"All of a sudden, our already really expensive mortgage was going to go up.</span> I was pregnant and everything was just bad timing on our part.<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nThree years later, the couple is back in the market.</span> The Del Rosarios were recently approved for a loan for <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $280,000 home</span> in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, which, when it is completed in January, will have three bedrooms and a two-car garage. Instead of proximity to work, they picked the location based on its school district and their desire to live there a long time. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">And while they now must <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pay $300 a</span> month in mortgage insurance, the family's income has grown, and their total mortgage payment is still a little lower than before, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $2,400.</span></span> \"We're trying to be really conservative. We just want to have a nice place for our son,\" she says.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">There is a web of rules for when and how people who have lost homes to foreclosure or short sales or have gone through a bankruptcy can become eligible for a new mortgage.</span> It typically takes three years after a foreclosure or short sale for a buyer to qualify for an FHA-backed loan. In many cases, it takes just one year after a <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</span> discharge, according to the agency.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac require a wait period of as much as seven years after a foreclosure or short sale before a consumer can become eligible for a conventional mortgage, though some short sellers can purchase again after as little as two years.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Becoming eligible for a new mortgage doesn't mean that buyers will necessarily qualify for one.</span> Lenders still require borrowers to have strong credit score and to have been paying their other bills on time.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Until recently, many of the people who had lost their home to foreclosure or short sale have rented homes, leaving many economists and industry watchers to wonder if the nation would become more of a renter society.</span> In the second quarter, the national home-ownership rate came in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 65.5%,</span> down <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 65.9% a</span> year earlier <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 69.2% in</span> the second quarter <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2004.</span> Each percentage-point decline represents about one million households.\n\nBut as rental rates continue rising\u2014they <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 0.8% in</span> the third quarter to a national average <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1,090 per</span> month, according to Reis Inc.\u2014homeownership is increasingly becoming cheaper than renting.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That is part of what enticed Ronda Martinez,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 39,</span> back in to the market.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2007,</span> she and her husband, Mark, let their two-story,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $430,000 home</span> in Perris, Calif., go into foreclosure when they were unable to sell it when required to move to Phoenix for a job.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Later, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010,</span> she was laid off from her job at a real-estate-data company.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Since then, the family has repaired their finances, and Mrs. Martinez found a new job.</span> This month, the family is closing on <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $150,000 home</span> in Phoenix that has five bedrooms and a pool in the back.\n\n\"Initially people are upset and think, 'I'll never buy again,' \" she said.

similar story for oil prices, which many investors believe should rise if economic prospects are improving.</span> Instead, crude has swung in both directions following past rate cuts.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">As markets enter the second half <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of<span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span></span> analysts and investors are closely watching the Fed, putting new emphasis on the central bank\u2019s meeting at the end of the month.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If the Fed lowers rates, it would mark its first rate cut <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008,</span> when it began embracing easy money after the financial crisis.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2015,</span> but they still remain well below precrisis levels.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The possible change of course comes at a time when other global central banks are shifting toward easing monetary policy, just after they had begun tentatively stepping away from postcrisis policies.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Bets on lower rates helped push the S&<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 and</span> Dow industrials to fresh records last week, with indexes from the U.S. to Europe <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 15% or</span> more for the year.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Some analysts warn lower rates won\u2019t support stocks and other risky investments if the economy slows markedly, as many investors expect, or morphs into a recession.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unfounded optimism that this recovery could be perpetually supported by fiscal and monetary policy,\u201d says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus.</span> \u201cThat\u2019s not indefinitely positive.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">So do economic conditions today look more like they did in the market-fueled downturns of the \u201990s, or in the buildup to the housing crisis of 2007?\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Some investors say current conditions are comparable to those surrounding Fed rate cuts <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995 and</span></span></span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1998,</span></span> when the central bank eased policy and a recession didn\u2019t follow.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The unemployment rate is currently near its lowest level in almost five decades, and some analysts expect economic growth to slow from its first-quarter annual rate <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 3.1% but</span> remain stable.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report Friday, investors this week will parse minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting and figures on consumer prices to gauge the trajectory of U.S. growth.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Stubbornly soft inflation has also given some analysts confidence that the Fed will lower rates later this month.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s semiannual testimony to Congress will also be in focus this week.\n\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Another factor keeping investors optimistic: Interest rates still remain relatively low compared with historical levels.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Following the best first half of the year for the S&<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 since</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1997,</span> analysts are also weighing whether investors are too optimistic about the effects of rate cuts.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Stocks have risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of a Fed rate cut later this month.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1995,</span> they also rallied before the Fed lowered rates, only to continue their run.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1998 rate</span> cut was preceded by sharp stock-market declines as the meltdown of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management nearly brought down the financial system.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Markets stabilized after the Fed cut rates.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2001,</span> stocks also slid before the central bank cut rates as the tech-stock bubble burst.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Some analysts say protectionist trade policies are muddying the economic outlook to such an extent that past interest-rate cycles aren\u2019t comparable to the current period.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">An index measuring economic-policy uncertainty around the world created by professors at Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago climbed near its highest level ever last month.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Even if the Fed lowers rates, some analysts are skeptical business and consumer spending will pick up if the U.S.-China trade fight remains unresolved.</span> That could mean recent optimism driving stocks higher is misplaced, these analysts say.\n\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s gone way too far,\u201d says Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf the Fed cuts and people don\u2019t want to borrow because capital spending is frozen basically, what you end up with is a lot of money just sitting in the banks.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">In one warning sign that the 10-year-old economic expansion could come to an end relatively soon, the gap between long- and short-term bond yields, known as the yield curve, turned negative earlier this year.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">A yield curve inversion has preceded the last several recessions, though they have often occurred well after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has dropped below the three-month yield in the past.\n\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">There is also the issue of timing investments around Fed rate cuts.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">An analysis of similar periods during which the Fed cut rates after previously raising them by Toronto money manager Gluskin Sheff & Associates showed the S&<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 returned</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22% on</span> average in the year following the last interest-rate cut of each cycle.\n\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">The gap between the performance of stocks and the 10-year Treasury note was also much bigger following the final rate cut of each cycle than after the first time rates dropped, the analysis found.</span> Gluskin Sheff also included rate-cut periods starting <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984,</span><span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1987 and</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1989.</span>\n\n<span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou want to resist the temptation at all costs to jump in after the first rate cut,\u201d says David Rosenberg, the firm\u2019s chief

Mom and Dad put a tenant in the garage. And now Grandma's moving in. But packing them in like that isn't always legal.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The suburban single-family home is becoming a misnomer as economic reality collides with shifting demographics.\n\n</span>Many suburban communities have long made it difficult, or impossible, for homeowners to convert underused space\u2014barns, garages and basements\u2014into rental apartments. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But across the U.S., homeowners are pressing for changes in zoning laws to allow rentals while home builders report a rise in demand for houses with in-law suites or quarters with separate entry.\n\n</span>\"There's a change at both ends,\" said Dean Palos, the director of planning in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City, which is exploring allowing multiple dwellings in one house. \"College graduates are going home to live, parents who are aging want to downsize. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">People see this as an economical way to take advantage of the property they have.</span>\"\n\nFor decades, many suburban communities have discouraged renting out space in single-family homes, citing concerns including traffic, parking and stress on utilities.\n\nSix years ago, Johnson County considered but ultimately didn't pass a measure to allow so-called accessory units. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But with both the job and housing markets struggling to recover, \"now they are far more sympathetic,\" Mr. Palos said of the county planning commissioners.</span> At least half a dozen recent meetings have been devoted to the issue.\n\nOne of five college graduates, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 25 to</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 34,</span> is living with his or her parents, according to the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, the number of shared households\u2014meaning an adult not enrolled in school living with another adult who isn't a spouse\u2014<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 11.4% between</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2007 and</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010,</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 19.7 million</span> households <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 22 million</span>, the Census reported last month. Yet the number of households grew <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 1.3% during</span> the period.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">That number has stagnated as families double up and college graduates accept lower-wage jobs, unable to rent a place of their own.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Economists in part blame the slow recovery of the housing sector on young people who aren't setting up house on their own.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The brunt of America's detached single-family homes\u2014<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 41.9 million</span>, or more than half\u2014are in the suburbs, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies; cities and rural areas comprise the rest.\n\n</span>The rise in shared households challenges the ideals upon which American suburbs were built, including ample space for families, their homes and their cars. But as baby boomers who raised families in the suburbs now age there, many don't want to sell their homes\u2014or can't.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"People are occupying housing that is three to four times what they need,\" said Patrick Hare, a longtime advocate for and author of books about accessory housing.</span> \"If you take all that surplus space, it can be utilized for accessory apartments.\"\n\nThat's the calculation that prompted Richard Lacroix, a retired engineer, to ask the town of Arlington, Mass., a Boston suburb, to change local zoning to allow homeowners to create and rent out accessory apartments. He has lived in his four-bedroom home <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1971 and</span> saw an exodus of longtime neighbors because they couldn't afford to stay. He wanted to convert his garage into a studio apartment.\n\n\"I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">am 73 years</span> old,\" he said. \"They should let people age in place. The town is looking to a substantial increase in property taxes.\" In May, the proposal was defeated in a town meeting. Mr. Lacroix, who prepared and presented a 17-page report on the merits of accessory units, says he plans to raise the issue again. His annual property taxes <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are $8,000,</span> and he says they are only going up. \"It's just a matter of staying ahead,\" he said.\n\nZoning definitions and allowances for such rentals vary by locality. Some towns forbid the construction of kitchens or full bathrooms in areas of a home that could be rented out. Others have allowed multiple units for decades as long as one portion is occupied by a homeowner and there is adequate off-street parking and utility capacity.\n\nThe real-estate data firm Reis Inc. reported this month that U.S. apartment vacancy rates are at their lowest point in a decade, and that rents were at record levels in more <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90% of</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 82 markets</span> it tracks.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Economists say the tight rental market is forcing many people to consider alternatives that in better times were largely dismissed\u2014such as a room in a single-family home.\n\n</span>\"In some markets, like Washington, New York, San Francisco, [people] can't rent something in the areas they want to rent and they don't want to commute two hours away. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\"This may be making some communities more open to rentals and to think about housing more broadly than they have.</span>\"\n\nBuilders of new homes are responding to the new extended American family\u2014and their homes. Last year, Lennar Corp. rolled out a \"Next Gen\" model, calling it a \"home within a home.\" The houses feature a completely separate unit\u2014with own entry, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living area\u2014attached to the main house with a double door similar to adjoining hotel rooms.\n\n\"We can't build them fast enough,\" said Jeff Roos, president for Lennar's west region. \"People want to live together but not on top of each other.\" He said the houses are attracting primarily families who use the extra unit for their grown children or elderly parents; as a result, the builder hasn't faced much resistance from municipalities worried about rentals, he said.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In areas where the units are offered, which include Arizona, California and Nevada, the company <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">says 40% of</span> sales are Next Gen homes.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The homes range <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1,800 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4,000 square</span> feet, and they are priced from the <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">low $200,000s</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $500,000.</span>\n\n</span>But constructing accessory units in existing homes is drawing ire. The planning board in Montgomery County, Md., has asked the county council to consider a measure to allow conversions without homeowners going through a public hearing. Still, homeowners worry about strained public utilities, schools and even the availability of parking spaces. They say illegal conversions have been a problem for some time now.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"This is a good way to supplement income on a fixed income like retirees,\" said Valerie Berton, spokeswoman for the planning department.</span> \"People would much prefer to see this than see foreclosures happening.\"\n\n\"They act as boarding houses without any legal review,\" said Carol Petzold, who lives in Montgomery County and is a board member of the Aspen Hill Civic Association. \"An occasional accessory apartment in a neighborhood is one thing, but when they pile up, there's not enough room on our residential streets for all their vehicles.\"\n\nFor tenants, such aesthetics likely won't matter. \"At some level, you're looking for additional rental housing anywhere you can find it,\" <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span>\n\nWrite to S.

{"id": "82117", "displayed_text": "<h3>Full TPP Text Reveals A Very Bad Deal for America - Breitbart</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is finally public, after years of President Obama\u2019s secret negotiations and a refusal to share the text openly with Congress and the American people.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Unsurprisingly, the document is full of special deals for various U.S. trading partners, foreign corporations, and multinational U.S. businesses.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The TPP is anything but the free trade agreement it purports to be.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The use of the term \u201cfree trade,\u201d however, is both a smokescreen to conceal what it really contains and a codeword designed in part to attract the support of Congressional Republicans who lurch zombie-like to support anything labeled free trade, without understanding or even examining the details.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The top Obama Administration trade negotiator, Michael Froman, admitted as much when he insisted the deal cannot be re-negotiated, particularly over the lax rules on importing foreign-made autos and auto parts into the United States.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Apparently, one of America\u2019s biggest economic problems is that Toyota does not sell enough cars and trucks here, and thus does not displace enough American jobs.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The TPP deal allows Toyota a special concession to keep its global supply chain intact.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">TPP lowers the already too low NAFTA parts content standard, and permits Toyota to export vehicles to the United States that contain a large percentage of parts produced in non-TPP countries.</span> And so, other Asian countries such as China, who are not even TPP partners are beneficiaries. Hard to believe, right?\nU.S. auto makers and Congressional Democrats are unhappy with the concession and want it renegotiated. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But according to Froman, \u201cHere we <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 12 countries</span>, half of whom we already have free trade agreements with, where every issue is tied to every other issue.</span> You pull the string out on one of these issues and you unravel the whole thing.\u201d Thus Froman admits that the TPP deal is shot through with favoritism and crony arrangements\u2026but it can\u2019t be altered.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">A real free-trade deal could be written on a single sheet of paper, with commitments to remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers of any kind \u2014 including the removal of Value Added Taxes (VATs) applied to American exports at the port of entry \u2014 and pledges to refrain from the currency manipulation that cheapens and subsidizes the cost of foreign exports.</span> But is the TPP one page \u2014 or even two? No, it contains thousands of pages <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 30 chapters</span>, only a few of which deal with tariff reduction.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The other chapters deal with rules and regulations for all manner of things not directly related to trade.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">For example, there are labor and environmental chapters hailed by President Obama as the \u201cmost progressive ever.\u201d\n</span>But the big problem, whether one is for or against these chapters in principal, is that the president is deceiving us. These chapters are completely unenforceable. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Are we really going to have a fleet of labor rights and environmental inspectors cruising around Vietnam, checking to make sure that every last factory is being fair to its workers and not polluting?</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Or tramping through the jungles of Malaysia to make sure that the government has put an end to the human trafficking and forced labor camps?</span> No, it\u2019s just not humanly possible.\nIncidentally, there are two major missed opportunities within the TPP. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">And these have to do with the United States not using a Value Added Tax (VAT) and not manipulating its currency.</span> Froman claims to have <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">cut 18,000 tariffs</span> in the TPP, but he has completely neglected the most significant tariff of all \u2014 foreign VAT taxation. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">All of the other TPP countries (except tiny Brunei) utilize a VAT tax system.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">This is a major trade barrier that imposes a direct tax on U.S. exports, but it is completely unaddressed in the TPP.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">As for currency manipulation, the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency and is freely traded in markets throughout the world.</span> However, a significant number of TPP countries manipulate their currencies to give their goods a competitive advantage over American products.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But in the TPP, there are only side agreements to discuss currency manipulation via reporting requirements and consultative mechanisms.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">What these side deals mean is that a country can continue to intervene in currency markets, and then the U.S. can discuss the matter \u2014 without the ability to do anything about it.</span> That is not a concession or an \u201cextremely meaningful\u201d accomplishment, as Froman has said. It is a surrender \u2014 at a time when the U.S. could have addressed the problem.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The TPP is being touted as giving a big boost to the American economy.</span> That\u2019s the rationale for doing the deal in the first place, right?\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But there is no economic study or model that shows any big net benefit to the United States.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">There is one Peterson Institute study, cited by the U.S. Trade Representative, that shows a <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">minimal 0.4 percent</span> gain for the American economy <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2025.</span></span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s hardly enough to start reducing our immense and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">growing $18 trillion</span> national debt.</span> And two U.S. Department of Agriculture studies show no net gain in agriculture from the TPP. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Why sign the agreement if it doesn\u2019t help with the national debt?</span> Two words: Special Interests.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, the TPP is a complex series of rules and regulations intended to manage the economic relations between <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 nations</span> party to the agreement.</span> And its meticulous design serves to benefit each country\u2019s \u201cnational champion\u201d companies and industries, with the big winners in the U.S. being the major Wall Street banks, insurance companies, and multinational manufacturer-outsourcers.\nOne big example of this complex hypocrisy: The TPP has, in addition <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 30 main</span> chapters, a total <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 58 side</span> agreements (called \u201cside letters.\u201d) <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">And Japan alone <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">possesses 14 of</span> these side letters, with each one laying out special conditions for Japanese participation and special deals for Japanese economic sectors.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Free trade?</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Hardly!\nRepublicans allegedly hate regulatory regimes \u2014 but apparently are okay with them if they are done on an international scale under the rubric of free trade.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">What\u2019s wrong with this picture and party?\nKevin L.

Putin of Russia of \u201cstrong economic and other measures\u201d from the U.S. and European allies if military tensions with Ukraine escalated.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">President Biden, in a high-stakes virtual meeting on Tuesday morning, warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of economic consequences if he continued to escalate a military presence around Ukraine, according to a White House statement.\n</span>The diplomatic effort came as tens of thousands of Russian troops mass along the Ukrainian border, raising fears of an invasion.\nJake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, described the president\u2019s comments to reporters.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\n</span>He later added, \u201cThere was a lot of give and take, there was no finger wagging, but the president was crystal clear about where the United States stands.\u201d\nMr. Sullivan said the administration was also prepared to send supplies and additional resources to Ukraine if Russia escalated its military presence.\nAsked for specifics for the consequences facing Russia, Mr. Sullivan declined to go into detail. \u201cI will look you in the eye and tell you as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today that things we did not do <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> we are prepared to do now,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the year Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Virtually no country has recognized the action, and Western powers continue to condemn Russia for it.\nThe U.S. and Russian leaders began their conversation via video-link at 10:07 a.m., according to the White House, and it ended at 12:08 p.m. According to the White House, they also discussed ransomware and issues related to Iran. Before the call, Biden officials said the discussion would cover nuclear arms control, cybersecurity and Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed to continue the dialogue on the issues discussed on Tuesday.\nMr. Biden would be speaking to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, on Thursday, Mr. Sullivan said.\nIn a brief video of the opening moments of the call released by Russian state television, Mr. Putin said, \u201cGreetings, Mr. President!\u201d\n\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Mr. Biden responded warmly, after what appeared to be a brief connection glitch. \u201cUnfortunately, last time we didn\u2019t get to see one another at the G20. I am hoping next time we meet we do it in person.\u201d\nThe video showed Mr. Putin seated at a long wooden desk, with Mr. Biden on a large video screen in front of him, and he waved to Mr. Biden as the call began. Mr. Putin took the call from his residence in Sochi, the Russian resort city on the Black Sea.\nAfter the call ended, Mr. Biden was expected to hold a separate call with multiple U.S. allies, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. The leaders had previously agreed to stay in contact on Russia\u2019s deployment to Ukraine, according to the White House.\nThe virtual meeting with Mr. Putin was a crucial test for Mr. Biden, as he tried to protect Ukraine, a democratic ally whose security U.S. officials have promised to defend, and head off a major European security crisis.\nMr. Putin has complained that Ukraine poses a threat to Russia through its close military and political ties to the United States and European powers.\nU.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin has not decided whether to invade Ukraine. But the United States has disclosed intelligence showing that Russia\u2019s military has developed a war plan that envisions as many <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 175,000 troops</span> pouring across Ukraine\u2019s border \u2014 an invasion force that Ukraine\u2019s military, despite U.S.-provided equipment and training, would have little ability to stop.\nDon\u2019t call it a Zoom.\nPresident Biden\u2019s talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday relied on a secure communications process about which the Biden administration has very little to say: not about conducting the call, or the full list of participants, or how the contents of the call will be memorialized.\n\u201cAs a general rule we would not talk about security measures or the logistics of the president\u2019s calls with world leaders,\u201d Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said.\nBut based on recent history \u2014 including details that emerged after a whistle-blower\u2019s revelations about former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 </span>\u2014 there are more than a few clues to piece together about the mechanics of the call.\nEach White House organizes its calls differently, according to Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a former cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, and sometimes the protocol can vary from leader to leader. But a secure call essentially means the communication between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin would be encrypted.\n\u201cA lot of other intelligence services out there would love to know what conversation actually took place between the president of the U.S. and the president of Russia,\u201d Mr. Daniel said in an interview. \u201cYou want to encrypt the bits as they\u2019re flowing\u201d from leader to leader.\nTo memorialize calls with foreign leaders, presidential administrations have relied on the so-called TNet system, a highly secure network that connects to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, a secure intranet system operated by the Defense Department. More sensitive files can be stored in an even more tightly controlled program, called NICE, for N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment: \u201cYou have a lot of control over what pieces of data that people can get to depending on their access,\u201d Mr. Daniel added.\nThe calls are organized through the National Security Council, with the council\u2019s executive secretary overseeing the logistics. Often, the president, working with the national security adviser, decides who will be present or able to listen in for the calls.\nMr. Biden\u2019s side of the call was in the Situation Room, which is historically where presidents have hosted secure calls with other world leaders. Mr. Putin\u2019s side was from his residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Tass, the state news agency.\nThe longstanding White House policy is to not record calls held in the Situation Room, according to Larry Pfeiffer, who served as a director of the Situation Room during the Obama administration. Instead, there is a transcription, which, he said, allows the White House \u201cboth a historical record that can be relied upon but allows for plausible deniability\u201d if something unflattering were to leak. (The limits of transcription were exposed in some detail two years ago, in the aftermath of accusations that aides to then President Donald J. Trump mishandled the system to store a call with the Ukrainian president.)\nMr. Biden was solo onscreen when the call started, but it is common practice to have aides on hand listening to the call. Each would have a designated role. The Situation Room is equipped with voice-to-text translation software, and a note taker relies on that software to assemble an account of what the two leaders say. In this case, several experts said, a translator would also likely be present.\nA subject-matter expert on the National Security Council is also generally present. That person looks over the material from the call, reviews and edits it based on their understanding of the foreign leader and current events, and then passes it along to the national security adviser.\nMr. Biden\u2019s advisers say that the president believes that there are benefits to meeting face-to-face and in-person with a leader like Mr. Putin. But with mounting Russian aggression toward Ukraine and the threat of an invasion hanging in the balance, Mr. Biden did not have the luxury of travel time to practice his preferred in-person approach to diplomacy. On Tuesday, the day of their call, machine-gun fire and the flash of rocket-propelled grenades were reported along Ukraine\u2019s border.\nWith Putin-Biden meeting, skirmishes break out between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists.\nThe Ukrainian military exchanged fire with Russian-backed separatists using machine guns and grenade launchers on Tuesday, the day on which President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia discussed ways to ease mounting tensions in the region.\nWhile the skirmish was not unusual, it was a reminder that even as leaders in Moscow and Washington were engaging in high-stakes diplomatic negotiations, a war that has claimed thousands of lives over the past seven years showed no signs of abating.\nA recent influx of Russian soldiers along the border with Ukraine has led to fears of a wider conflagration and the prospect that Russia might be planning an invasion of the eastern European nation.\nThe exchange of fire on Tuesday broke out at three locations along the so-called line of contact, a roughly 250-mile-long barricade of trenches and fortifications between Ukrainian soldiers and their opponents in a protracted war of attrition.\nThe Ukrainian side suffered no casualties, according to the press office of the Ukrainian armed services. It was unclear if the separatists had any losses. According to the Ukrainians, it was the separatists who fired first.\n\u201cUkrainian defenders opened fire in response,\u201d the press service said in a statement, \u201cand forced the enemy to cease fire.\u201d\nThough such violence occurs almost daily in the region, in this period of explosive tension there are fears that an errant bullet or mortar shell could be all that is needed to touch off a serious escalation. Even when fired upon, Ukrainian soldiers are under strict orders not to respond unless absolutely necessary.\n\u201cThis really annoys the soldiers, that we\u2019re not allowed to respond,\u201d said First Lt. Ivan Skuratovsky, of Ukraine\u2019s 25th Airborne Brigade, which is deployed at the front in the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka.\nSerious casualties on the front lines are uncommon these days, though a handful of Ukrainian soldiers are killed each month, usually by sniper fire. There were seven soldiers killed in September, two in October and six in November. Last week, a 22-year-old soldier named Valeriy Herovkin became the first killed in December.\nAs concern mounts over Russia\u2019s menacing massing of troops on the Ukrainian border, many analysts say that the fate of the eastern European nation matters far more to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than to the Biden administration.\nMr. Putin speaks often about the former Soviet republic\u2019s historical and ethnic ties to Russia, while President Biden has said his goal is to establish a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia.\nBut Mr. Putin, who raised similar alarms with a deployment near Ukraine this spring, has once again seized the attention of Washington. And he came to Tuesday\u2019s meeting with demands of his own, including his insistence that NATO forswear the possibility of making Ukraine a member of the alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have countered that Moscow cannot dictate the foreign policy choices of other nations.\nEven if he does not plan to invade Ukraine, Mr. Putin may be wagering that Mr. Biden\u2019s preoccupation with matters like the coronavirus pandemic and competition with China will make him inclined to strike a deal.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cSeen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin\u2019s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kyiv or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine,\u201d Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in an analysis published on Monday.\n</span>\u201cRather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin\u2019s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs,\u201d Mr. Samorukov added. For Mr. Putin, any moves by Ukrainian leaders to draw closer to the West are an affront.\nComplicating matters for Mr. Biden is European uncertainty about how to handle Mr. Putin\u2019s newest threats. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">European nations are dependent on Russia for much of their energy supplies, and their economies stand to suffer if relations with Russia deteriorate further.\n</span>The Biden administration has been negotiating with European leaders in an effort to unify around which punishments could be inflicted on Russia for any new aggression.\nThe first time that President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia encountered each other in a leader-to-leader summit, it was on a sunny day last June at an estate on Lake Geneva \u2014 and the meeting was dominated by ransomware attacks on the United States, rather than the specter of an invasion of Ukraine.\nMr. Biden had, weeks before, agreed with the characterization of Mr. Putin as a \u201ckiller.\u201d Mr. Putin denied that Russia was behind a remarkably broad breach of American corporate and government computer networks \u2014 the \u201cSolar Winds\u201d attack which was discovered a year ago, just as Mr. Biden was preparing to take office \u2014 traced to one of Russia\u2019s premier intelligence agencies.\n\u201cWe want a stable, predictable relationship,\u201d Mr. Biden said going into the summit, an acknowledgment that the heady days of the 1990s, when there was talk of Russia joining Europe (and maybe, eventually, even NATO) were gone forever, and that the best that could be hoped for was good communications.\nThe Geneva meeting was tense. \u201cI did what I came to do,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden said after the meeting, including laying out a series of warnings and red lines for the Russian leader, which he insisted were not \u201cthreats.\u201d \u201cI think the last thing he wants now is a Cold War.\u201d\nMr. Putin called Mr. Biden \u201cconstructive, well-balanced and experienced,\u201d and said he wanted agreements on \u201crules of behavior\u201d on sensitive subjects like nuclear weapons and cybersecurity \u2014 an echo of American officials\u2019 hopes of finding \u201cguardrails\u201d for the U.S.-Russian relationship.\nMr. Biden emerged offering some modest optimism that the United States, by restoring its alliances in Europe, had made Mr. Putin more cautious about any actions regarded as being against Western interests.\nFor a few months it looked like something was getting done. Led by Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, talks began on \u201cstrategic stability,\u201d the diplomatic code words for managing the nuclear arsenal \u2014 and, increasingly, space and cyberweapons \u2014 in ways that do not lead to accidental war or unnecessary military escalation. Another set of conversations, quiet and private, took place between Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and her Russian counterpart. Ransomware attacks continued, the F.B.I. reported, but nothing that seemed threatening to critical infrastructure.\nBut in October and November, just as the administration was promoting modest progress, satellite photographs began to appear on desks around Washington showing a major buildup of forces around Ukraine. The administration sent William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former American ambassador to Russia, to send a warning.\nApparently, the message didn\u2019t get through.\nAVDIIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 Machine-gun fire broke the stillness just <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 8 p</span>.m. when Capt. Denis Branitskii was midway through the evening patrol. The shots came in sporadic bursts and were close by, fired by Russian-backed separatists whose positions were obscured in the darkness. Only when the flash of a rocket-propelled grenade illuminated the newly fallen snow did Captain Branitskii break his stride, briefly pausing to take cover before moving on.\n\u201cThis happens every night,\u201d said Captain Branitskii, a cleft-chinned company commander with the Ukrainian military\u2019s 25th Airborne Brigade, positioned along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s much heavier, sometimes it\u2019s like tonight. Tonight, this is fine.\u201d\nThis is the scene on the front lines right now, ahead of a phone call on Tuesday between President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at staving off a far more serious military escalation. After eight years of war, few in Ukraine believe the call will lead to an immediate breakthrough that might spare their country further violence.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a breakthrough,\u201d said Dmitry Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cPutin will hear very clear signals from President Biden about what Ukraine\u2019s partners will do if Putin comes head with a military operation against our country.\u201d\nMr. Kuleba said that following the call, Mr. Biden would speak with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nSo far, soldiers on the front lines said they had seen little evidence of escalation beyond a largely slow-moving war of attrition that set in after both sides fought to a stalemate over territory seized by Russian-backed forces <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014.</span> Compared with the vicious fighting that preceded it, this is a holiday, several soldiers said.\nOn Monday, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Ukrainian armed forces, Mr. Zelensky donned a helmet and flak jacket and visited the troops on the front lines. He later announced that Ukraine\u2019s frontline brigades would soon be getting new weapons systems including modernized tanks and armored personnel carriers. He also announced that Ukraine had signed a deal with Britain to build a new fleet of gunboats and purchase new anti-mine ships.\nThe Ukrainian military has made significant progress <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014,</span> when it nearly disintegrated in the face of a lightning operation by Russian forces to seize territory, first by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then by fomenting a separatist takeover in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nUkrainian troops have since fought alongside NATO forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and trained with American military advisors.\nBut few believe that Ukraine\u2019s military could hold out for long against a full-on Russian invasion. Some military analysts have said that, at most, Ukraine would at best manage an organized retreat.\nIf a full-on attack comes, Ukrainian forces are as ready to face it as they\u2019ve ever been, said Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, commander of the Joint Forces Operation battling the separatists. But even this, he acknowledged, would not be enough to hold off the Russian military without significant assistance from Western countries, specifically the United States.\n\u201cThis is a beast who has tasted blood,\u201d General Pavlyuk said. \u201cBelieve me, the losses are going to be horrible on both sides \u2014 thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. On their side and ours.\u201d\nAs vice president during the Obama administration, Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the lead role in managing America\u2019s relationship with Ukraine as it fended off Russian aggression.\nNow, as president, Mr. Biden is making a dramatic effort to rescue the country from the gravest threat it has faced in decades, by trying to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia not to mount the invasion that U.S. officials say he is planning.\nPresident Barack Obama gave Mr. Biden the Ukraine portfolio in his second term, after Ukraine\u2019s Russia-backed president was ousted in a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2014 popular</span> revolution. Mr. Putin considers the pro-Western leadership that came in at that time both an affront and a security threat.\nIn the following years, Mr. Biden visited Ukraine a half-dozen times, forging relationships with politicians and activists. After Mr. Putin annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and fomented rebellion in the country\u2019s east, Mr. Biden declared \u201cthe unwavering support of the United States of America and the American people\u201d for Ukraine.\n\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of freedom-loving people the world over are with you because so much rides on your fragile experiment with democracy succeeding,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2015 speech</span> to Ukraine\u2019s Parliament.\n\u201cI was the point man for our administration on the crisis, which was exactly where I wanted to be,\u201d Mr. Biden later wrote in a memoir. He scoffed at critics who predicted that Ukraine would amount to a defeat for the West at Mr. Putin\u2019s hands, one that would haunt him politically. \u201cI didn\u2019t much care. There was an important principle at stake: Big countries ought not to beat up smaller ones,\u201d he wrote.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s engagement did bring a political cost: It would expose him to political attacks \u2014 frequently in exaggerated and distorted terms \u2014 by Donald J. Trump and his allies over his son Hunter\u2019s lucrative work for a Ukrainian energy company.\n</span>At times as vice president, Mr. Biden pressed Mr. Obama \u2014 who was reluctant to be drawn into mutual escalation with Mr. Putin in Russia\u2019s back yard \u2014 to provide Ukraine with more support, like anti-tank Javelin missiles.\nBut in the memoir, Mr. Biden also recalls agreeing with Mr. Obama that there was only so much the United States could promise to a country whose importance to America is hard to distill.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe president and I agreed that we could and should convince our European allies to support and extend serious economic sanctions against Russia.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But economic sanctions were as far as the United States and its allies in Europe would go,\u201d he wrote.\n</span>Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s videoconference, the Kremlin has been signaling one core conviction: Russia cares more about Ukraine\u2019s fate than the West ever will.\nIn speeches, interviews and lengthy articles, President Vladimir V. Putin and his close associates have telegraphed a singular fixation in recent months on the former Soviet republic. The Kremlin thesis goes that Ukrainians are \u201cone people\u201d with Russians, living in a failing state controlled by Western forces determined to divide and conquer the post-Soviet world.\nUkrainians, who ousted a Russia-friendly president <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 and</span> are increasingly in favor of binding their country to Western institutions, would largely beg to differ. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Putin\u2019s conviction finds a receptive ear among many Russians, who see themselves as linked intimately with Ukraine by generations of linguistic, cultural, economic, political and family ties.</span> Now, with a force <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 175,000 Russian</span> troops poised to be in position near Ukraine by early next year, in what Western officials fear could be a prelude to an invasion, centuries of shared history loom large.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Putin\u2019s gambit may be a cold calculus of coercion \u2014 a way to force President Biden to recognize a Russian sphere of interest in Eastern Europe.</span> But to Mr. Putin, and many other Russians, the nearly eight-year-old conflict with Ukraine is not simply about geopolitics; it is about a hurt national psyche, a historical injustice to be set right. A former Kremlin adviser, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, describes the Kremlin\u2019s view of Ukraine as a \u201ctrauma wrapped in a trauma\u201d \u2014 the dissolution of the Soviet Union coupled with the separation of a nation Russians viewed as an extension of their own.\n\u201cOne of the colossal problems pushing us into conflict is that Russian identity does not exist without Ukrainian identity,\u201d said Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Parliament who was the only lawmaker to vote against the Crimea annexation and later fled to Ukraine.\nWhile other conflicts in the post-Soviet world have pitted one ethnic group against another, the one between Russia and Ukraine is more complicated. Ukrainian is Ukraine\u2019s official language, but Russian \u2014 which is closely related \u2014 is still widely spoken. Russians often view Kyiv, now the Ukrainian capital and once the center of the medieval Kyivan Rus, as the birthplace of their nation. Russian-language writers like Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov came from Ukraine, as did the Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, now speaks Ukrainian in public but first gained fame as a Russian-language comedian who performed across the former Soviet Union.\nTo many Ukrainians, Mr. Putin\u2019s appeal to a shared history is little but a hollow attempt to appropriate the country\u2019s own heritage and justify territorial ambitions.\n\u201cThey stole our past,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a pro-Western think tank in Kyiv. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to steal our future.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">With the large Russian troop buildup on the borders of Ukraine, White House, NATO and European leaders have been working to project a united front to deter the Kremlin and convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that there would be a heavy price to pay in the event of war.\n</span>On the eve of his virtual summit with Mr. Putin, President Biden spoke with allied leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain.\n\u201cThe leaders discussed their shared concern about the Russian military buildup on Ukraine\u2019s borders and Russia\u2019s increasingly harsh rhetoric,\u201d according to a readout from the White House. They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions, the statement said, and agreed that diplomacy was the only way forward.\nEven as the leaders issued assurances of solidarity, many European officials are worried that Mr. Putin could respond to pressure by diminishing gas supplies to Europe as winter approaches.\nThe crisis also comes as Germany is changing leadership and France is facing an election, creating a shifting landscape that the White House fears the Kremlin might move to exploit.\nAt the Pentagon on Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III convened top military and civilian officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the head of the military\u2019s European Command, to discuss the Russian troop buildup.\nOfficials said that there was an effort underway to send additional defensive weapons, including anti-tank Javelins, to Ukraine, but that they may be kept in position outside the country to avoid giving Mr. Putin a pretext for military action.\nSome NATO country officials have counseled against such a move, suggesting that it would not make much difference in the outcome if an invasion should come and could provoke Mr. Putin, rather than deter him.\nGiven the risks involved, some analysts, like Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argue that Mr. Putin is seeking diplomatic leverage and that the main aim of his troop buildup is not to conquer Ukraine but to get a satisfactory response from the United States.\n\u201cPutin is clearly frustrated about being ignored by Washington,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. He noted that Mr. Putin\u2019s earlier troop buildup near Ukraine secured him an early summit meeting with Mr. Biden in June. \u201cThis time it will bring Biden to a dialogue on Ukraine and other security issues in Europe.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trenin said the use of force could not be ruled out.\nJohn F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, declined to say whether the United States still had a small number of military advisers in Ukraine or whether the administration had decided to send additional military assistance there.\nThe Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that \u201ca major war in Ukraine would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In an open letter to the Atlantic Council, he said that among other major concerns for European society, a war could result in \u201cbetween three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion\u201d and could seriously disrupt food imports, including of grain, \u201ccreating a whole range of food security problems for the entire continent.\u201d\n</span>\u201cRussia\u2019s attack would also mark a definitive end to the rules-based international order, opening the door to a new era of global insecurity that would threaten decades of unprecedented peace throughout most of Europe,\u201d he wrote.\nWith Donald J.

Still, the discussion revealed some were more anxious about the possibility of overdoing the increases, while others worried they might not be making enough progress to warrant a downshift.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Some from the first camp said the risks were rising that the Fed\u2019s rate increases might ultimately \u201cexceed what was required to bring inflation back\u201d to <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">their 2% goal</span></span>.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">A few also warned that continuing to raise rates <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 0.75</span>-point increments \u201cincreased the risk of instability or dislocations in the financial system,\u201d the minutes said.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A small minority believed it might be better to wait to slow increases until rates were \u201cmore clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly,\u201d the minutes said.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">At their September meeting, most Fed officials projected that they would raise the benchmark federal-funds to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 4.6% early</span> next year.\n</span>Officials didn\u2019t release new rate projections at their meeting this month. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at Nov.<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 news</span> conference that if they had, they would have been higher given recent strength in the labor market and high inflation readings.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The minutes said that officials thought that high inflation and the strong labor market would call for raising the benchmark federal-funds rate next year to a level \u201csomewhat higher than they had previously expected.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The Fed is raising rates to combat inflation by slowing the economy through tighter financial conditions\u2014such as higher borrowing costs, lower stock prices and a stronger dollar\u2014which typically curb demand.\n</span>The central bank\u2019s staff saw a U.S. recession next year \u201cas almost as likely\u201d as their baseline projection of weak growth, the minutes showed. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That represented a downgrade of the economic outlook due to the tightening of financial conditions that had occurred this fall.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nIs the Fed taking the right steps to combat inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.\nIn more recent public comments, officials have broadly endorsed approving <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5</span>-point increase at their Dec. 13-14 meeting as they acknowledged the risks of causing an unnecessarily deep downturn.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cA rate hike <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 50 basis</span> points would still be significant,\u201d said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in a speech earlier this month.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Fed governor Christopher Waller last week said the central bank could still raise rates aggressively in coming months even if officials reduce the size of their increases <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.5 point</span>.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He compared the Fed\u2019s task to a pilot finding a comfortable cruising altitude after takeoff.</span> \u201cAs the policy rate gets higher, the stronger is the case for slowing the rate of ascent while continuing to climb,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">This summer and fall, several Fed officials suggested they would want to see evidence that inflation is declining toward <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">their 2% goal</span></span> before slowing or stopping rate increases.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But at a press conference on Nov.<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span> Mr. Powell suggested a sequence of slower inflation readings had never been \u201cthe appropriate test\u201d for slowing or halting rate rises.\n</span>Instead, officials including Mr. Powell have shifted the

Plenty of companies are loss-making after they join the index, especially this year; it is odd that once in the club, the condition no longer applies.\nDavid Blitzer, who retired as chairman of the S&P index committee last year, says the profitability rule was introduced <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2000 as</span> dot-coms boomed, because a previous \u201cgoing-concern\u201d condition was seen as too vague.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Other than the profits rule, the fundamentals of a stock were almost completely ignored by the committee.</span> Almost. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe only time valuations came up is if a stock had a big run up that no one could explain, because no one wanted to put a stock in [the index] and then have it <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drop 25% the</span> next week,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Tesla stock is up sixfold this year and trading at more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 times</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">forecast 2021 earnings</span>.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The profits rule is only the most glaring of many conflicts between an investor tool and a gauge of the market.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Investors want anything that helps performance and eases trading, while a measure of the market should be comprehensive.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 is</span> by design not comprehensive, including only big stocks, but if it can exclude such a huge company as Tesla, what is it for?\n</span>The answer, according to S&P\u2019s website, is that it \u201cis widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.\u201d In the world of investment, that is pretty much all there is: If everyone uses the S&P as the benchmark, you have to pay attention. As Tesla\u2019s move last week showed, the sheer weight of money means the S&P matters.\nThis has perverse effects, because other indexes, with different rules, are used elsewhere. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The result is that the same stock can sit in several benchmarks, attracting money from those tracking, say the eurozone, as well as the U.S.\u2014and contributing to the widely used futures tied to those indexes.\nConsider TechnipFMC PLC.</span> The British-registered oil-services company is the second-smallest member of the S&P by value, and so is at risk of being booted out next month to make way for Tesla. (It might also stay, as the committee isn\u2019t forced to remove any particular company, any more than it was forced to add Tesla.)\nOn Wednesday, TechnipFMC\u2014formed from the merger of French and U.S. companies\u2014was one of the best performers in the index. It was also one of the best performers in the Euro Stoxx index, where it is classified as a French company, and in Vanguard\u2019s popular FTSE Europe ETF, where it is also treated as French. So a diversified portfolio using benchmarks from different index providers would probably have TechnipFMC twice\u2014neither of them in the place where it is legally based.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">When index investing got going in the 1970s, this wasn\u2019t a problem because almost all companies were listed in the country where they were registered, based and did most of their business.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Globalization has broken the links, with companies shifting for tax reasons, more cross-border mergers and many multinationals doing most of their business outside their home countries.\n</span>\u201cWhere a company is listed is pretty much irrelevant in today\u2019s situation,\u201d says Martyn Hole, an investment director at Capital Group, whose Capital International provided the \u201cCI\u201d in MSCI. (They are no longer linked.) <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">He says aside from some corporate-governance rules and governmental pressure, stock pickers should focus on where companies make their money, not where they happen to be listed.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The index providers are in a bind, sometimes focusing on listing location, sometimes on legal status, and other times on where a company does its business\u2014in part because of what investors want.\n</span>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">How have you handled investments in stock indexes this year?</span> Do you plan to follow the same strategy in 2021? Join the conversation below.\nMSCI includes foreign-listed companies in its home-country indexes where there are a lot of them, as with Israel, China and the Netherlands. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">There aren\u2019t many German companies listed overseas, so German vaccine maker BioNTech SE, which IPO\u2019d on Nasdaq, doesn\u2019t qualify for MSCI\u2019s German or European indexes.</span> Because it is German, it doesn\u2019t qualify for MSCI USA either. On the other hand, Tesla has been in MSCI\u2019s U.S. indexes <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010,</span> because there is no rule on profits.\nMost of these problems can be avoided by using very broad global indexes, such as MSCI All Country World or FTSE All-World, which have several large ETFs tracking them. There are still differences in which stocks qualify, notably nonvoting shares, but such an approach does at least avoid the biggest anomalies.\nInvestors still need to pay attention. There are vast amounts of money being shifted around based on strange and conflicting rules.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\nAppeared in the <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 23,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span> print edition as 'Tesla Shows Why Indexes Are Weird.'", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}

Foreign-Exchange Markets; \u2018Unspoken Currency War Has Broken Out\u2019\n\nUpdated Feb.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 7</span>:28 pm ET\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The central-bank stimulus spree <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2015 has</span> the look of a global currency war.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">In quick succession, countries representing about a third of the world\u2019s economic output\u2014from the eurozone to China, Australia and Canada\u2014have taken steps that have driven down the value of their currencies.\n\n</span>But if it\u2019s a war, it\u2019s a gentle one so far.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Half the central banks representing the Group <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 developed</span> and large emerging economies, whose top monetary and finance officials meet to discuss the global economy this week in Istanbul, have taken easing steps so far this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The moves\u2014mainly in the form of interest-rate cuts but also asset purchases\u2014have ricocheted through foreign-exchange markets, driving the currencies of some countries down and those of others, primarily the U.S., up.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">That helps the economies of countries that are easing while complicating life for some central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and creating challenges for exporters, from the U.S. to Switzerland and Denmark.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,\u201d David Woo and Vadim Iaralov at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, noting that the magnitude of currency-market swings this year has hit its highest noncrisis level <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 20 years</span>.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mention of currency war evokes images of countries deliberately trying to force their currencies down to boost exports and curb imports at their neighbors\u2019 expense.</span> By definition, it\u2019s a zero-sum game.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">This is a bit different: Central banks by and large aren\u2019t specifically aiming to achieve a certain\u2014weak\u2014exchange rate, for instance by buying up foreign currencies on the open market, as in currency wars of the past.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They are doing what they think is best for their economies and, if their currencies weaken in response, so much the better.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">With the possible exception of Switzerland, whose economy may be rattled by the sudden surge in the franc after the country\u2019s central bank unexpectedly dropped its currency ceiling against the euro last month, there aren\u2019t any clear victims yet.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Indeed, there\u2019s a positive-sum aspect to these currency wars.</span> As one central bank eases, others are forced to follow suit to offset the upward pressure on their currencies.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Unlike past easy-money campaigns, these latest efforts\u2014from economies totaling <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $36 trillion</span> in annual output\u2014aren\u2019t aimed at addressing financial crises, as with the U.S.-led global effort six years ago.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Rather, central banks are taking aim at the risks of too-low inflation and weak economic growth.\n\n</span>The frenzy of easing policies began in Europe, once a center of conservative central banking with Germany\u2019s Bundesbank at its core. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program, mostly government debt, last month that could swell beyond \u20ac1 trillion (<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1.13 trillion</span>) by the fall <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2016.</span>\n\n</span>That sent a tidal wave through the continent. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Switzerland responded before the program was even announced last month by abandoning the ceiling it had set on the franc\u2019s level against the euro, as markets widely anticipated the ECB\u2019s move, while Denmark slashed interest rates four times in three weeks.</span> Switzerland and Denmark also accumulated massive amounts of foreign currencies last month to keep a lid on their currencies\u2019 strength. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Sweden and Poland might cut rates in coming weeks, analysts say, and the Czech central bank has said it is ready to take steps to keep its currency weak against the euro.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Europeans have turned the common-sense idea that official interest rates can go only so low on its head.</span> Deposit rates on bank reserves set by the Swiss and Danish central banks are each at -0.75%. The ECB also has a negative deposit rate, at -0.2%, which means banks must pay a fee to park excess cash with their central bank.\n\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe are sort of testing the limits,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n</span>These policies have brought bond yields to rock-bottom levels and pushed equities higher. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The hope is that all this global easing will bolster global demand.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">But there are doubts as to how much more stimulus officials can get from asset markets.\n\n</span>That leaves currencies as the main transmission channel. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In an era of weak global growth and very low inflation, central bankers can take aggressive currency-weakening measures such as printing money or pushing rates into negative territory without having to worry about any inflationary consequences.\n\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">That makes exports cheaper in economies with looser monetary policies, and more expensive in those that are holding the line.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Even if recent measures haven\u2019t been directly aimed at currencies, \u201cthe impact of domestically oriented policies naturally has an impact on the exchange rate,\u201d said Hung Tran, managing director at the Institute of International Finance.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The U.S. is already seeing the negative effects of a stronger dollar, with trade slicing one percentage point from fourth-quarter growth.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Still, its economy is cranking out jobs at a rapid pace.\n\n</span>With Europe still wrestling with stagnation and political turmoil in Greece, and growth softening in key emerging markets such as China, the pressure on central banks will likely remain intense.\n\nTommy Stubbington contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}

The country produces <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span></span></span> of the world\u2019s oil supplies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily oil exports <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7.4 million</span> barrels by as much as three-quarters, taking <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 5 percent</span> of global supplies off the market, unless the facility is quickly repaired.\n</span>President Trump suggested on Sunday that he could release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an attempt to calm oil markets. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Brent crude oil futures briefly spiked <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 percent</span>, or more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $11 a</span> barrel, when trading started on Monday and then eased to an increase of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span></span></span>, or just <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $6 a</span> barrel.\n</span>The attack raised the possibility of further disruptions in Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production if there were additional attacks on its fields and pipelines.\nThe planned initial public offering of the kingdom\u2019s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, could also be hurt if international investors doubt Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to defend its vital energy infrastructure.\nBut as luck would have it, the attack came as global oil stockpiles were higher than usual, several producing countries have ample spare capacity and American oil facilities have so far been spared from a damaging hurricane season. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, a slowing global economy has moderated energy demand.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe do not expect an immediate disruption on global oil trade, since many nations, including the U.S., have ample crude oil in storage,\u201d said Manish Raj, chief financial officer of Velandera Energy Partners, a Louisiana oil exploration and production company.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe Saudis themselves have enough storage to meet their export obligation for the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">next 60 days</span>.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Therefore, we expect no supply-demand imbalance in the near term.\u201d\n</span>The main uncertainty is how long will it take for the Saudis to repair the Abqaiq facility, which separates gas from oil from several important oil fields. While the fire was put out quickly, the Saudis may not know the answer for days since the facility is large and has complex equipment that still needs to be tested.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Should the damage be fixed quickly, Eurasia Group, a risk consulting firm, estimates that oil prices could rise a <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">modest $2 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $3 a</span> barrel, which would still leave the global benchmark Brent crude <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $65 a</span> barrel, relatively low by recent historical standards.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The firm estimated that a more long-lasting disruption could mean an increase <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $10 a</span> barrel, though that would still leave prices several dollars below where they were a year ago.\n</span>Other analysts took a dimmer view, even as Saudi Aramco said on Sunday that repairs were already underway. The initial reaction of oil traders was panicky.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe problem is that the attack is so significant, \u201c said Bill Farren-Price a director at RS Energy Group, a market research firm.</span> \u201cIt demonstrates that one of the best regional oil companies has difficulties defending itself from this new style of threat. That theme is going to endure. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201c\nThere are doubts the Saudis will be able to maintain their usual exports and satisfy domestic consumption.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cExport volumes will be severely impacted,\u201d Clay Seigle, an analyst at Genscape, a market research firm, said in an email.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe market will be left with a thinner cushion against additional supply disruptions, and traders will bid prices higher as a result.\u201d\n</span>How the other countries in the Saudi-led OPEC will respond is not yet clear. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In a phone conversation, an official with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said that the Saudis had so far not shared information about the extent of the damage and when output might be restored.</span> He also said that OPEC had not yet begun discussions on potentially loosening supplies. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe have to see how the market reacts tomorrow,\u201d the official said.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was $2.57 on</span> Sunday,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 28 cents</span> lower than a year ago.</span> That decline has been a boon to consumers, giving them extra spending power that has helped retailers and restaurants. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">An increase in prices to last year\u2019s levels is possible over the next few weeks unless the Saudi facility is quickly fixed, energy analysts said.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Only a decade ago, the attack would probably have sent oil prices soaring.</span> But that was before American oil production climbed with the shale drilling frenzy. The United States now produces <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 12.1 million</span> barrels a day, double what it produced <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012 and</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.4 million</span> barrels more than only a year ago.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The United States imports <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 630,000 barrels</span> of Saudi oil a day, down about half <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2017.</span>\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">American oil companies have recently been cutting back on production, but higher oil prices would encourage them to produce more.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">At the same time, several pipelines to the Gulf Coast are nearing completion and that could stimulate significant export growth over the next six <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 months</span>.\n</span>Other oil-producing countries are also ramping up production, including Norway and Brazil, while Iraq, Nigeria and Russia have been producing a total <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 650,000 barrels</span> of oil above the levels agreed to with their OPEC partners.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The United States and other developed countries have <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 3 billion</span> barrels in stockpiles, according to the International Energy Agency, enough to take care of about two months of demand.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">That is <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50 million</span> barrels above a year ago, despite American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that have constricted their exports.\n</span>The stockpiles of the industrialized countries are at their highest level since <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2017,</span> and are <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 20 million</span> barrels above the average of the last five years, according to the energy agency.\n\u201cFor now, markets are well-supplied with ample commercial stocks, \u201c the agency said in a statement on Saturday, adding that it was \u201cmonitoring\u201d the Saudi situation.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Saudi Arabia has <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 27 days</span> of supply stockpiled, according to S&P Global Platts, a provider of energy information.</span> That stockpile is stored not only in the kingdom but also Egypt, Japan and the Netherlands for added security.\nThe developed countries and China have sizable strategic reserves as well in cases of emergency, although stockpiles have been declining in the United States and Europe in recent weeks.\nUntil this weekend, OPEC has been more concerned about oversupply than shortages. As recently as Thursday, oil officials from OPEC, Russia and other producers met in Abu Dhabi and appeared to call for even tighter adherence to the production cuts they have maintained for almost three years. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Those cuts were aimed at propping up prices and keeping the market from being swamped by oil.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The United States alone has as much <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 713 million</span> barrels in its strategic reserve, and administration officials are already talking about releasing some oil on the market to tamp down any gasoline price increase.\n</span>President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday evening that he had \u201cauthorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed.\u201d.\nSuch releases have had a powerful psychological effect on oil markets since the reserve was established after the oil embargoes of the 1970s. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It has been drawn only occasionally, including during the first Persian Gulf war <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span> Hurricane Katrina <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005 and</span> during the Arab Spring <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span> when Libyan exports were halted.</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 33s "}}

He denounced the GOP vote as \"pointless\" and declared the impasse to be back at \"<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Square 1.</span>\"\n\nThe White House said that if the House bill reached President Barack Obama, who championed the health law, he would veto it.\n\nThe stare-down between the two chambers intensified as Democratic aides said Mr. Reid had no plans to call the Senate into session before its planned Monday afternoon return. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That will be just hours before government funding for many federal functions runs out with the end of the fiscal year.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The next step is unclear, as no official business on Capitol Hill is planned for Sunday.</span> There was no sign negotiations were being scheduled among congressional leaders, and no lawmakers\u2014from graybeards to backbenchers\u2014said they were optimistic that a shutdown would be averted.\n\nIn a blunt acknowledgment of that prospect, the House early Sunday also approved legislation to ensure that military personnel would be paid in the event of a shutdown.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Republicans have been determined to use the budget deadline as leverage in their long-running battle to undercut the health care law, which reaches a landmark moment on Tuesday, when one of its most important components takes effect.</span> On that day, people can begin to sign up for health insurance policies through new online marketplaces.\n\n\"The American people don't want a government shutdown, and they don't want Obamacare,\" House Republican leaders said in a joint statement about their government-funding bill. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown.</span>\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll panic and do the right thing for once,\" Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) said of the Senate. \"Republicans are extremely unified at this point.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) was under pressure from conservative House members to carry the fight against the health law as long as possible.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"Pushing until the very, very last minute has been one of the mainstays of the House GOP's negotiating strategy on budget issues,\" said Stan Collender a former aide to the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a budget specialist at Qorvis Communications.</span> If House Republicans eventually accede to a simple funding bill, shorn of changes to the new health law, it won't likely be until the 11th hour on Monday, he said.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Some Republicans held hope that the Senate would agree at least to repeal the medical devices tax, giving the House GOP a victory.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">In votes earlier this year, senators from both parties backed a repeal, but Democrats were unlikely to do so as part of the current budget fight.\n\n</span>Democrats criticized House Republican leaders for moving to pass measures so close to the deadline that were bound to fail in the Senate. The longest-serving member of the House, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) had particularly harsh words.\n\n\"This once-deliberative body has been taken over by knaves and know-nothings, content with putting partisan politics ahead of the American people,'' Mr. Dingell said.\n\nHe added: \"I believe that this current Congress would be incapable of passing the Ten Commandments or even the Lord's Prayer, and today's actions have only further galvanized that belief.\"\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Some 800,000 of</span> more than two million federal workers were furloughed in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1995 shutdown</span>, with fewer workers affected in a following shutdown that stretched into <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 1996.</span> The number who would be furloughed this time is unclear and would vary by agency. The Pentagon has said <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 400,000 civilian</span> defense workers would be sent home.\n\nPostal and air traffic control services would continue, and Social Security checks would be mailed. But many federal functions would be suspended, such as surveillance of flu and other diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National parks and museums would close.\n\nSome Republicans said that the bill taken up by the House on Saturday night was unlikely to break the stalemate. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In the Senate, Democratic leaders can strike the health care delay and medical device tax amendments with a 51-vote majority, then send the funding bill back to the House.\n\n</span>Lawmakers weren't sure what Mr. Boehner's next step would be in that case.\n\nThe House could pass the Senate's funding measure, stripped of provisions related to the health law, and send it to Mr. Obama, as the Senate has insisted. Lawmakers could also buy more time by passing a short extension of funding, perhaps for a week.\n\nBut Republicans said they might take another stab at amending the spending bill and dare the Senate to let the government shut down. At the same time, some of the GOP caucus's more centrist members worried about the rapidly shrinking window of time. \"I hope it works, but it may not,'' said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.).\n\nThe House bill emerged midday from an uncommon Saturday meeting of the House Republican Conference, where GOP leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers agreed on the details of their bill.\n\nMany House Republicans say their party would likely bear more of the public blame if the government is forced into a partial shutdown. But some argued Saturday that wasn't a reason to shift course.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Republicans said they believed that economic benefits flowing from a repeal of the medical-device tax would offset the loss of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $29 billion</span> in revenue <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 10 years</span>, the sum that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the tax will generate.\n\n</span>And some Republicans argued that their proposal to delay the health-care law by one year represented a compromise between their earlier push to defund the law and Democrats' desire to keep it unchanged.\n\n\"Just delay this thing for one year\u2014it's really not too much to ask,\" said Rep. Trey Radel (R., Fla.).\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, saw little compromise in the House Republican plan. \"It's their way or the highway, and the highway leads over the cliff,\" said Rep. Sandy Levin (D., Mich.).\n\nIn the vote to delay the health law, two Republicans broke from their party to oppose a delay. They were New York Reps. Chris Gibson and Richard Hanna.\n\nTwo Democrats voted in favor of the one-year delay: Reps. Jim Matheson (D., Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D., N.C.).\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats are opposed to delaying the health law but have indicated they would entertain changes to improve the bill. But they have firmly opposed talking about even modest changes as part of negotiating the government funding bill.\n\nWrite to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}

{"id": "14194", "displayed_text": "<h3>US Inflation Is The Highest It's Been Since 1982</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation jumped in December at its fastest year-over-year pace in nearly four decades, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surging 7% and</span> raising costs for consumers, offsetting recent wage gains and heightening pressure on President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve to address what is increasingly Americans\u2019 central economic concern.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Prices have spiked during the recovery from the pandemic recession as Americans have ramped up spending on goods such as cars, furniture and appliances.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Those increased purchases have clogged ports and warehouses and exacerbated supply shortages of semiconductors and other parts.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Gas prices, while declining a bit from November to December, have surged in the past year, in part because Americans have driven more in recent months after having cut back on travel and commuting earlier in the pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department reported Wednesday that excluding volatile food and gas prices, so-called core prices <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surged 0.6% from</span> November to December, slightly more than <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 0.5% increase</span> from October to November.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Measured year over year, core prices <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumped 5.5% in</span> December, the fastest such increase <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1991.</span>\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Rising prices have wiped out the healthy pay increases that many Americans have been receiving, making it harder for households, especially lower-income families, to afford basic expenses.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Poll show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern, making clear the political threat it poses to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">A significant portion of consumer inflation is still being driven by pandemic-driven mismatches between demand and supply.</span> Used car costs <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 3.5% from</span> November to December and have soared more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 37% compared</span> with a year ago. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">With new car production restrained by shortages of semiconductors, consumers have snapped up used cars, forcing up their costs.\nShortages at U.S. grocery stores have also grown more acute in recent weeks as new problems, like the omicron variant and severe weather, have compounded the supply chain struggles and labor shortages that have plagued retailers since the coronavirus pandemic erupted.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">On Tuesday, Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the Federal Reserve is prepared to accelerate the interest rate hikes it plans to begin this year if it deems it necessary to curb high inflation.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Fed officials have estimated that they will raise their benchmark short-term rate, now pegged near zero, three times this year.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Many economists envision as many as four Fed rate hikes <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Those rate increases would likely increase borrowing costs for home and auto purchases as well as for business loans, potentially slowing the economy.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The rate hikes also mark a sharp reversal in policy by Fed policymakers, who as recently as September had been split over whether to raise rates even once this year.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed is also rapidly ending its monthly bond purchases, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Yet the Fed\u2019s quick pivot hasn\u2019t quelled questions from many former Fed officials, economists and some senators about whether the Fed has acted too slowly to end its ultra-low-interest rate policies in the face of accelerating inflation \u2015 and put the economy at risk as a result.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In his testimony to Congress on Tuesday, Powell said the Fed mistakenly believed that supply chain bottlenecks that have helped drive up the prices of goods wouldn\u2019t last nearly as long as they have.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Once the supply chains were unsnarled, he said, prices would come back down.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Yet for now, the supply problems have persisted, and though there are signs that they are loosening in some industries, Powell acknowledged that progress has been limited.</span> He noted that many cargo ships remain docked outside the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation\u2019s largest, waiting to unload.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">With the Biden administration facing public discontent over the rise in inflation, President Joe Biden has said his administration\u2019s investments in ports, roads, bridges and other infrastructure would help ease inflation by loosening some snarled supply chains.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In the meantime, many restaurants have been passing some of their higher labor and food costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices.</span> So far, many consumers seem willing to pay more. Gene Lee, CEO of Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and other brands, told investors recently that this is \u201cthe toughest inflationary environment we\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The company said its food and beverage costs <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumped 9% during</span> the quarter, and its hourly wage costs rose <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 9% as</span> it raised pay to attract workers.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Darden said it raised its prices, in turn, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2% during</span> the quarter and expects to raise them <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 4% over</span> the next two quarters to help compensate.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Rick Cardenas, the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said those higher prices have yet to reduce consumer demand.</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}

Biden Jr. strode into a reception room in Athens for a meeting with the president of Greece, a country then drowning in debt and locked in tense negotiations with the European Union.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis man represents the Treasury Department,\u201d a deadpan Mr. Biden said to his host as he gestured to a gray-suited member of his delegation.</span> \u201cHe\u2019s brought hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\nThe room broke up in laughter: It was clear the vice president hadn\u2019t come with a briefcase of cash to pay off Greece\u2019s debts. But his joke captured a deeper truth \u2014 <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span></span></span> many still viewed the United States as the ultimate guarantor of the international order. And Mr. Biden clearly saw himself as a steward of that legacy, his easy self-confidence the product of four decades as a globe-trotting senator.\nAs Mr. Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday, vowing to \u201crepair our alliances and engage with the world once more,\u201d the question for many overseas is whether they will see this man of the world anytime soon.\nIn capitals from Europe to Asia, diplomats and foreign-policy experts have questioned whether the United States is too divided, too weakened and too preoccupied by internal convulsions to play the kind of leadership role that Mr. Biden took for granted as a senator and vice president.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Yet there are reasons to believe President Biden will be more visible and activist than many expect, even as he grapples with the pandemic, a massive economic recovery effort, and the deep divisions left by the Trump era.</span> From the people he has chosen for key foreign policy posts to the travel opportunities he has this year, those who know Mr. Biden say he is unlikely to stay off the global stage for long.\n\u201cThis is a guy who <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 40 years</span> getting to know foreign leaders around the world,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, who lived next door to Mr. Biden as British ambassador to Washington during the Obama administration. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got a flavor for international relationships, you don\u2019t turn your back on all that.\u201d\nWolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States, said he expected Mr. Biden to draw on his personal relationships to mend bonds with European allies that had been sundered by former President Donald J. Trump.\n\u201cJoe Biden is a master of networking, and he will easily repair the lack of trust,\u201d said Mr. Ischinger, who now runs the Munich Security Forum.\nThe Presidential Inauguration \u203a\nHow to Follow Today\u2019s Inauguration\n- Our briefing will track the highlights, takeaways and key moments of the day.\n- In our live reporter chat, watch the inauguration ceremony and follow along as reporters discuss the day moment by moment.\n- See scenes from the Capitol as Biden prepares to take his oath in our live blog.\nMr. Ischinger\u2019s immediate goal is to persuade the president to attend his influential annual conference. He has a decent chance of landing him: Mr. Biden has been a staple in Munich for years, most memorably <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009,</span> when he announced that President Barack Obama wanted to hit the \u201creset button\u201d with Russia.\nIn his inaugural address, Mr. Biden said the \u201cworld is watching.\u201d He promised that the United States had \u201ccome out stronger\u201d from its recent stress test. And he pledged a restoration of American leadership in which, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll lead, not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\u201d\nMr. Biden is likely to make his formal debut at a meeting of Group <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 leaders</span> in June, which Britain is hosting at a seaside resort in Cornwall. He may expand that trip to include other European destinations, including Germany, where he could bid farewell to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she steps down <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 16 years</span>.\nIn the fall, Mr. Biden is expected to attend a Group <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 meeting</span> in Rome and the United Nations\u2019 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where he could showcase his decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord.\nBeyond dates in the diplomatic diary, experts contend that Mr. Biden\u2019s appointments do not suggest an inward-looking White House.\nHis choice of Kurt M. Campbell to serve as a high-level coordinator of Asia policy, for example, could foretell a tough line with China coupled with an energetic effort to reassure American allies Japan and South Korea. As a State Department official in the Obama administration, Mr. Campbell devised the so-called \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia.\n\u201cBiden has chosen people who understand and are committed to strategic competition,\u201d said Thomas Wright, a foreign-policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nSome experts argue that the chaos at the Capitol had compromised the nation\u2019s traditional role as a champion of democracy, and that the cascading domestic crises would consume Mr. Biden\u2019s energy, distracting from world affairs.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cAmbitious foreign-policy goals are completely out of step with the realities of the country\u2019s domestic political and economic dysfunction,\u201d Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in Foreign Policy.</span> \u201cHow can the United States spread democracy or act as an example for others if it barely has a functioning democracy at home?\u201d\nBut Mr. Wright argued that the homegrown threats to democracy should strengthen the Biden administration\u2019s resolve to fight human-rights abuses by China, Russia, and other autocratic governments.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019ve never understood the trade-off between ambition at home and ambition overseas,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because democracy is challenged at home that the U.S. needs to be more energetic in defending democracy overseas.\u201d\nThe links between domestic and foreign policy were reinforced by the appointment of Susan E. Rice, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Obama, as director of Mr. Biden\u2019s domestic policy council. Key domestic priorities like the pandemic, experts pointed out, are also global challenges.\nAnother top Biden aide, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, used Twitter to weigh in on sensitive issues before his boss took office. He condemned Russia\u2019s arrest of the opposition leader Alexei A. Navalny, appealed to the European Union to think twice before signing an investment treaty with China, and said Mr. Trump\u2019s designation of the Houthi rebels in Yemen as a terrorist group \u201cwill only inflict more suffering on Yemeni people.\u201d\nWhether the Biden administration will back up those words with action remains to be seen, of course. But some say that Mr. Biden\u2019s instincts, temperament and background as a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee make him unlikely to shrug off chances to command the world stage.\nAs vice president, he reveled in his access to world leaders. On a trip to Turkey <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span></span></span> there were doubts that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was recuperating from a medical procedure, would see him. Instead, Mr. Erdogan invited him to his private residence, where the two men, wearing slippers, spoke for two hours about Syria and Iran.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m inflating my importance or relationship with him,\u201d a chuffed Mr. Biden told reporters, \u201cbut we have listened to each other. And he was genuinely listening to my perspective and wasn\u2019t challenging it.\u201d\nAt other times, Mr. Biden has taken pride in his readiness to speak bluntly to foreign leaders. He famously walked out of a dinner with Afghanistan\u2019s president, Hamid Karzai, <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 after</span> a rancorous exchange over corruption.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012,</span> Mr. Biden was assigned to play host to Xi Jinping, then China\u2019s vice president and designated future leader, when he visited the United States. Toasting Mr. Xi at a Valentine\u2019s Day lunch, Mr. Biden ran through a litany of grievances, from Chinese theft of intellectual property to human rights abuses.\n\u201cCooperation, as you and I have spoken about, can only be mutually beneficial if the game is fair,\u201d Mr. Biden said as Mr. Xi looked on.\nOn a trip to China the following year, Mr. Biden publicly criticized China for refusing to say if it would renew the visas of American correspondents and for blocking the websites of American-based news media. Several years later, China expelled correspondents for The New York Times and other publications.\nSpeaking as a president, to be sure, is different than as vice president. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">During his trip to Greece <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span></span></span> Mr. Biden ruminated about the risks of commenting on the fiscal tensions between Greece and the European Union.\n</span>\u201cYou know, in the good old days when I was a senator, I was my own man,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters at the time. \u201cI could just tell you my views. But now whatever I say is attributed to the administration.\u201d\n\u201cI finally learned that,\u201d said the man who now leads his own administration. \u201cIt took me about six months, but I got it down.\u201d\nAdvertisement", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 16s "}}

The company aims to ramp up its inoculation rates, which like the rest of the country have slowed down.\n\nThough vaccine supplies are plentiful, more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2 in</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 U</span>.S. adults still aren\u2019t fully vaccinated, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sixty-seven percent had gotten at least one dose as of <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 3,</span> which remains shy of President Biden\u2019s goal <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 70 percent</span> \u2014 a crucial benchmark toward reaching herd immunity \u2014 by the Fourth of July.\n\n\u201cOur company, like the country at large, has seen a bit of a slowdown in the number of people actually getting the vaccine,\u201d Roger Krone, chairman and chief executive of Leidos, told The Post. \u201cWe see a huge need to gently push people who are on the fence, and give them one more reason to do it.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Though Leidos has been spared from the widespread outbreaks seen in the grocery, meatpacking and other industries, the company said it has lost eight employees to the pandemic.</span> One of them, Keith Redding, was among the first to die of the virus in the D.C. area. A company foundation in his name has <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $1.8 million</span> to the families of other coronavirus victims.\n\nBut as companies like Leidos prepare for a full return to in-person work, managers are working to guard their factory floors and office hallways against becoming points of transmission for a virus that has killed more <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 604,000 Americans</span>.\n\nThe fast-moving delta variant, which poses special risk to unvaccinated people, has upped the ante. The nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has called it the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to ending the U.S. pandemic. The delta variant also moved the Biden administration to activate \u201csurge response\u201d teams that will deploy additional expertise and supplies to hot spots.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has confirmed that federal law, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, does not preclude companies from making vaccinations mandatory in the workforce.</span> Some companies have done so, occasionally stirring controversy.\n\nOther are opting for the carrot over the stick. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Retail and grocery chains including Trader Joe\u2019s, Aldi and Dollar General have used various incentives to encourage vaccinations.</span> In most cases, the incentives add up to a few hundred dollars or a day off.\n\nComing off a profitable year, executives from <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $14.5 billion</span> company wanted to craft an incentive program that would make more of a splash. Krone and other executives said they chose a lottery after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), announced that he would offer <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">five $1 million</span> prizes to vaccinated state residents, along with four-year college scholarships for five vaccinated Ohioans younger <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 18.</span>\n\nFive days after its rollout, the Ohio Department of Health announced the Vax-a-Million campaign had driven <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 28 percent</span> increase in the vaccination rates of <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">residents 16 and</span> older. Other states have also gone the lottery route, including Maryland, Oregon and California.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Leidos\u2019s lottery will award each employee the equivalent of one year of salary.</span> Because managers are excluded from the sweepstakes, the company estimates its outlay will be <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1 million</span>\n\nThe company announced the initiative last Monday, along with a call for sign-ups, and has already enrolled more than a third of its workforce. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Employees are not required to show proof of vaccination when they sign up.\n\n</span>Those with a legitimate reason to opt out of the vaccine, such as a medical condition, can still enter the sweepstakes without getting inoculated, an executive said.
