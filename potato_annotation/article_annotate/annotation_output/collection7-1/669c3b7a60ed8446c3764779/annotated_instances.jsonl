Quarter <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020\nCentral</span> bank seeks to avoid a recurrence of unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month\nThe Federal Reserve said it would buy short-term Treasury debt beginning next week to avoid a recurrence of the unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Fed will buy Treasury bills beginning next Tuesday at an initial pace <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $60 billion</span> a month and continue those purchases into the second quarter <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020.</span>\n</span>The announcement Friday marked a U-turn for the central bank, which until August had been shrinking its <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $4 trillion</span></span> asset portfolio.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Fed said the actions were \u201cpurely technical measures to support the effective implementation\u201d of the rate-setting committee\u2019s policy \u201cand do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Fed officials stopped shrinking the assets on their balance sheet this summer but never said when they would allow them to grow again.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">As a result, a crucial liability on the balance sheet\u2014bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves\u2014has continued to decline.\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks had grown reluctant to lend those reserves and that the Fed may have let them to fall too low.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span> last month, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Fed said its goal will be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system to levels of <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $1.5 trillion</span> that prevailed in early September.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is a much needed bazooka from the Fed,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates at Bank of</span> America Corp. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt shows the Fed is finally doing what is necessary to correct their mistake from dropping reserves too low.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Newsletter Sign-up\nChanges in how the Fed administers its rate decisions and in bank regulation earlier this decade, along with increased government debt issuance over the past year, have made it harder for the Fed to determine how many reserves it could drain from the system.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of time where the Fed and others are in a learning-by-doing mode,\u201d said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at financial-services company Jefferies LLC.</span> \u201cThey have been making the right adjustments and, just as important, they are being very transparent about it.\u201d\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the announcement in a speech Tuesday.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the Fed\u2019s funding plan would be designed to maintain a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates and not to provide economic stimulus.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed bought longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive stimulus campaigns <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 that</span> became known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said Tuesday. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, officials will instead buy shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee met by videoconference on Oct.<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 to</span> discuss recent developments in money markets.</span> It approved the plans unanimously on Friday.\nThe committee last met on Sept. 17-18, as the spike in overnight funding markets occurred. Their next scheduled meeting is Oct. 29-30.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The committee last made a policy change between its regularly scheduled policy meetings in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2010,</span> when it reopened a lending program with foreign central banks to alleviate funding pressures growing out of Europe\u2019s fiscal crisis.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Last month\u2019s spike in overnight funding markets led the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to trade outside of its range for one day.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">While the Fed quickly fixed the problem after it occurred, the funding-market dysfunction dinged the Fed\u2019s reputation among some interest-rate traders and raised questions over the central bank\u2019s strategy for its balance sheet.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The episode also followed a period in which New York Fed President John Williams dismissed the head of the bank\u2019s markets desk, which oversees the balance sheet.</span> He has yet to name a successor.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has swelled to <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $4 trillion</span></span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $3.8 trillion</span> over the past month because the New York Fed has been conducting temporary overnight and short-term lending operations to restore liquidity to markets for very-short-term loans that banks make to each other overnight, called repurchase or \u201crepo\u201d agreements.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed also said Friday it would continue to lend in repo markets through January of next year.</span> It will initially offer at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $35 billion</span> of multiday repo operations, generally twice a week. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Overnight repo operations will take place daily, initially in an offering amount of at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $75 billion</span> per operation, the Fed said.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The Fed has been purchasing up <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $20 billion</span> of a range of Treasury securities since August to replace maturing mortgage securities.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $60 billion</span> of monthly bill purchases announced Friday will be added to those purchases.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Personal [articles focused on an individual or small group of individuals]": "4"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 43s "}}

But coronavirus now threatens to put a damper on campaign season.\nIt's on \u2014 for now: President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all said that they will continue to hold campaign rallies despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassing 500\u2014 and the cancellation of other large-scale events and gatherings across the country amid concerns about its spread.\n- But Sanders suggested the situation is fluid: \u201cWe will not endanger the health of anybody in this country,\u201d Sanders said on CNN's \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201c \u2026 We are watching this thing very, very carefully. What is most important is the health of the American people.\u201d\n- Sanders said that \u201cin the best of all possible worlds\u201d the three candidates might want to scale back travel and their exposure to large crowds. \u201cBut right now, we're running as hard as we can.\u201d\n- Biden told reporters in Jackson, Miss., on Sunday \u2014 while rubbing Purell sanitizer on his hands \u2014 that his campaign is \u201clistening to the experts at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and doing everything they recommend.\u201d\n- The AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of unions, was the latest organization to cancel its presidential forum scheduled for this week in Orlando, Florida. Biden and Sanders were both slated to attend.\nThe comments show the dueling pressures on the trail: Sanders and Biden promise to run aggressive campaigns as they consolidate support in what's now a two-man race for the Democratic nomination \u2014 but don't want to downplay the recommendations of public health officials warning millions of Americans that large crowds could increase their risk of getting infected.\nAnd while Trump, for his part, has brushed off concerns about coronavirus and insisted as recently as Saturday that \u201cwe'll have tremendous rallies,\u201d our colleagues our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and Juliet Eilperin report that \u201cchanges to Trump\u2019s travel schedule are also being contemplated, after public health officials warned that elderly Americans should reconsider flying on airplanes and avoid large crowds.\u201d\n- \u201cTrump,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 73,</span> had no campaign rallies scheduled as of Sunday evening, marking the first time this year that there were no such events on the books,\u201d they note.\n- The next round of delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday when six states will vote: Idaho, Mississippi, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.\nBut public health officials have escalated warnings: \u201cIf you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,\u201d the nation's top expert on infectious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on NBC News's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cSo it's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable. When I say 'protect,' I mean right now. Not wait until things get worse. Say no large crowds, no long trips. And above all, don't get on a cruise ship.\u201d\n- Worth noting: Trump, like his fellow septuagenarian candidates Sanders and Biden, are \u201cat higher risk for serious illness from covid-19,\u201d according to guidance from the Centers For Disease Control (CDC).\n- It's up to individuals to decide what's best for them: \u201cThis will be a recommendation,\u201d Fauci added.\n- But their decisions now are critical: \u201cWe have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic,\u201d former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on CBS News's \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWhat you want to do is \u2026 put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted.\u201d\nPotential close calls at political events: The confirmed coronavirus cases at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Conservative Political Action Conference, both large gatherings of prominent politicians, activists and voters, have raised concerns about the virus's spread.\nThere's growing concern in the White House about Trump's own exposure: \u201cTrump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during [CPAC] last month,\u201d Toluse, Josh and Juliet report. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus that he has sought to minimize as it has rocked financial markets and tested his leadership skills.\u201d\n- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) decided to quarantine himself after being informed that he interacted with the CPAC attendee diagnosed with the virus: \u201cI'm not experiencing any symptoms and I feel fine and healthy,\u201d he wrote in a statement.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cNevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, Until <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 14 days</span> have passed since the CPAC interaction.\u201d\n</span>- Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) also announced that he is under self-quarantine after being in contact with the individual for \u201can extended period of time.\u201d \u201cI am closing my office in Washington, D.C. for the week and my team will follow the previously approved Tele-commute plan,\u201d he said.\n- There's broader \u201canxiety in an aging Congress,\u201d NBC's Kasie Hunt and Alex Moe report: \u201cMembers of Congress are becoming increasingly anxious about coronavirus, and there is growing pressure on leadership to take steps to protect lawmakers \u2014 even potentially recessing for a period of weeks \u2014 two Democratic congressional sources said Sunday.\u201d\nTHE WEEK AHEAD IN TRAVEL: But Trump's travel continues for now. The Republican Jewish Coalition is holding its annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas later this week where the president is currently a featured speaker. There are so far four confirmed cases of coronavirus in Nevada.\n- \u201cWe will announce rallies when we are ready to do so,\u201d Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, told our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Juliet Eilperin and Paige Winfield Cunningham. \u201cAnd we have loads of campaign events on the event schedule on the website,\u201d she added.\n- Sanders has an event scheduled today in Detroit with health officials to discuss the coronavirus.\n- Biden will also host an event in Detroit with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who just endorsed the former veep.\nPAST THE POINT OF CONTAINMENT: It might be only a matter of time before the federal response shifts and candidates are forced to cancel. U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams, part of the administration's task force on coronavirus, said on CBS News's \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the administration was past the point of \u201ccontainment\u201d and now \u201ctrying to help people understand how to mitigate the impact of disease spread.\u201d\n- \u201cWell, containment worked to slow the introduction of the virus and gave people time to prepare, and now we know that communities need to look at how we deal with \u2014 with community spread and things such as social distancing, not having large gatherings, pulling down events,\u201d Adams told Margaret Brennan. \u201cThose are conversations that communities need to be having right now.\u201d\n- What is social distancing?: \u201cI'm not asking everyone to stay at home and lock the door for a month,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen. \u201cI'm saying, be thoughtful every time you contemplate getting together with a crowd or group.\u201d\nBut Gottlieb suggested that more aggressive measures to mitigate the outbreak that Trump has been reticent to implement might be necessary. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He said policymakers should give state and local governments economic support so they can take more aggressive steps to limit people's exposure.\n- \u201cI think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy.</span> But that\u2019s what\u2019s going to need to happen,\u201d Gottlieb told Brennan of the idea of governors imposing mandatory quarantines in affected areas. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s going to need to happen. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">States and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic.\u201d\n-</span> And he urged the Trump administration to provide a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d: \u201cThere is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step, make that leap, if you will.\"\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At The White House\nWHITE HOUSE AND FED FIGHT OVER RESPONSE:</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Federal Reserve and the White House appear to disagree about the severity of the potential hit the coronavirus will inflict on the U.S. economy \u2013 and what to do in response, our colleagues Heather Long and Jeff Stein report.\n</span>- <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The Fed's view: Chair Jerome H. Powell and Fed officials have suggested that the central bank only has a limited role to play \u2014 though some other Fed officials have suggested a broader economic stimulus pushed by Congress or the White House would have a greater effect than power of interest rate cuts, our colleagues write.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The West Wing itself is divided about how to respond: \u201c[Trump] has raised the idea of a payroll tax cut to put more money in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d our colleagues report.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But Larry Kudlow, one of the president's top economic advisers, has rejected such a cut and prefers more targeted relief for specific industry.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">- Other ideas include things long on conservatives' wish lists, such as tax reductions on investment income.</span> There is also talk of possible tariff relief with China.\n- <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">A key graf: \u201cUnlike the seasoned economists and Wall Street players who dealt with <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 financial</span> panic such as Lawrence H. Summers, Timothy F.

Timothy Cole, rector of Christ Church Georgetown, our colleagues Fenit Nirappil, Rebecca Tan, Erin Cox and Jenna Portnoy report. \u201cAuthorities in Maryland and Virginia announced three new cases but said the risks for public exposure were low,\u201d they report.\nWhat governments are doing abroad: Italy and Saudi Arabia enacted new travel restrictions and Iran, the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East, suspended flights to Europe, our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Juliet Eilperin and Kim Bellware report\n- The situation in Italy has caused mass confusion: \u201cThe plan to lock down large swaths of the north was the first major attempt by a democracy during the coronavirus crisis to radically halt the routines of daily life \u2014 an effort that will have significant impacts on civil liberties,\u201d our colleagues Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli report from Rome. \u201cBut in the hours before and after the measure became law,\u201d people continued to travel to and from the northern hubs of Milan and Venice.\nWorth a read: Our colleagues Ashley Parker, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Lena H. Sun detail a \"portrait of the precious weeks that [Trump] and his administration frittered away in trying to deal with the coronavirus\u201d in a weekend piece outlining coronavirus testing, agency infighting and an apparently uninterested president.\n- Health experts say the White House did not use its time wisely: The administration should have requested emergency funding one month earlier, our colleagues report.\n- Had such funding come earlier, government agencies could have begun developing vaccines; the federal government could have made sure state and local health departments had the resources they needed and hospitals could have stockpiled supplies.\n- Trump defended his administration's response: \u201cWe have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">V.P. is doing a great job.</span> The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!\"\nGlobal Power\nMEXICO'S DAY WITHOUT WOMEN: \u201cWomen poured into the streets on Sunday to start a two-day protest and national strike against gender-based violence, in what organizers hope will be a turning point for women's rights in a country disfigured by violence and machismo,\u201d our colleague Mary Beth Sheridan reports from Mexico City.\n- \u201cThe annual demonstration for women\u2019s rights here has turned into something of a social uprising after a string of gruesome killings,\u201d our colleague writes. \u201cWomen took to the streets around the country \u2014 from U.S. border cities such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to communities in southern Guerrero state, where indigenous women and peasants joined marches.\u201d\n- This has become a major political challenge: President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has been one of Latin America's most popular leaders, but \u201chis approval ratings have slipped as he has responded in what many view as a ham-handed way to the wave of outrage over femicides.\u201d\nProtests marking international women's day took place around the world: \u201cFrom the streets of Manila to the plazas of Santiago, Chile,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201cTensions marred some celebrations, with police reportedly using tear gas to break up a demonstration by thousands of women in Turkey and security forces arresting demonstrators at a rally in Kyrgyzstan.\u201d\nViral\nJust in: Twitter applied its new manipulated media label for the first time to a deceptively edited video of Joe Biden. It was shared by White House social media director Dan Scavino, and retweeted by the president. pic.twitter.com/PggcCwMNkx\u2014 Cat Zakrzewski (@Cat_Zakrzewski) <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 8,</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 18s "}}

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996,</span> in need of a challenge and a boost to his business skills, Mr. Dupee enrolled in a joint MBA/JD program at Georgetown University.</span> \"Everyone at Green Mountain thought I'd take my law degree and work for the ACLU,\" he says. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Instead, he landed a job with the distressed-assets group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The group was responsible for searching distressed credit-card, small-business and mortgage debt for salvageable investments to buy and pool together.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Initially, Mr. Dupee's excitement about living in New York, landing a coveted job and working on multimillion-dollar deals buoyed him.</span> But over time, he says, he began to have doubts about his career path. \"It felt like there was something I should be doing that I wasn't.\"\n\nFor a while he used his sizable paycheck to pursue distractions from his career. He bought tickets to Yankee games and rock concerts, took sailing lessons and skied in the winter. But, in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2003,</span> three years after joining Goldman, Mr. Dupee decided he needed to make a fundamental change. At work, his team was broken up and re-assigned. He wasn't sure the opportunities he wanted would exist going forward. Meanwhile, work-related stress prevented him from sleeping and he began to worry about his health.\n\nRobert Koes, a fellow Wall Streeter and Mr. Dupee's then-roommate, wasn't surprised. \"I think he wanted to prove that he could succeed [at a firm like Goldman], which he did, but he was never that into it,\" Mr. Koes says.\n\nIn <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2004,</span> Mr. Dupee went home to Vermont to visit his parents and brought a copy of his r&eacute;sum&eacute; along. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\"I told myself I wasn't job hunting; I was just connecting with people in my network.\"</span> A friend there suggested that Mr. Dupee get in touch with Robert Stiller, the founder and then chief executive of Green Mountain.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Back in New York, sitting at a Goldman trading desk, Mr. Dupee got a call from Mr. Stiller, who told him about a position he wanted to create -- a corporate social-responsibility officer who would be the nexus for efforts, including fair-trade coffee, environmental programs and community activism.</span> \"This part of my brain that hadn't been tapped in eight years started to wake up,\" he says. \"I hadn't talked to a dreamer, which is what [Mr. Stiller] is, in years, and it felt really good.\"\n\nHe took the offer, pay cut and all, and moved back to Vermont. But he no longer works insane hours and now feels his work is in keeping with his values and interests.\n\nIt wasn't an entirely easy transition, as Mr. Dupee had to come up to speed on an emerging profession. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That meant figuring out what sorts of efforts are realistic to accomplish, how to work with people in other parts of the business to get those things done and how to measure success.</span> Even though he has returned to his roots, Mr. Dupee says his graduate degrees and prior experience have served him well. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He says that in school and at Goldman, he learned how to navigate office politics, \"speak the language of business\" and to frame environmental or energy-saving initiatives in terms of savings and profits.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">For his part, Mr. Koes isn't surprised that his friend feels at home in his new job.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"At the end of the day, he could have gotten a degree in 17th-century French literature and ultimately would have found this same job,\" he says.\n\n</span>87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Personal [articles focused on an individual or small group of individuals]": "4"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
