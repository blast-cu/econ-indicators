Graham Brady, the chair of <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1922 committee</span></span>, the Conservative Party\u2019s parliamentary group, announced a sweeping change to the rules, truncating what is usually a two-month process.\nAny Conservative lawmaker can put their name forward, provided they have the backing of at <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 100 of</span> their party colleagues in Parliament \u2014 a fairly high bar.\nJeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the Exchequer who has twice tried to become prime minister, quickly ruled himself out.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Names bandied about as possible contenders include former finance minister Rishi Sunak, Truss\u2019s main rival in the last leadership race, who warned that her economic policies would end in disaster \u2014 a \u201cfantasy land\u201d he called it.\n</span>There\u2019s also Penny Mordaunt, the current leader of the House of Commons, who came in third in the last contest and is popular with the Conservative Party faithful \u2014 though in snap polling of the broader public most respondents could not name her when shown a photo.\nAnother option: The return of Boris Johnson. Rumors are building that he could mount a push for the rare role of once-and-future prime minister.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His allies told the British papers that he felt it was in the \u201cnational interest\u201d for him to stage a return.\n</span>A lot of voters might not want Johnson or his party to give it another try. The Conservatives have been in power <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 years</span> and millions of bad headlines. If there were a general election now, they would almost certainly be annihilated. The opposition Labour Party is <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 30 points</span> in opinion polls.\nLabour leader Keir Starmer, who hasn\u2019t had to do much more than sit back and watch his rivals implode, called for a general election \u201cnow.\u201d\n\u201cThe Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,\u201d Starmer said in a statement following Truss\u2019s announcement. \u201cThey do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish.\u201d\nBut because the Tories led by Johnson won a general election <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019,</span> they don\u2019t have to submit to another vote <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2024.</span> A motion to call for an early election would need at least two-thirds of the votes in Parliament. That would only be possible if the Conservatives support the measure, which they would be loath to do while they are down so far in the polls.\nTruss herself should have been safe from another leadership challenge for at least a year. But Conservatives are known for ruthlessly casting aside their leaders. Out went David Cameron for opposing Brexit. Out went Theresa May for failing to get Brexit done. Out went Johnson for a pileup of scandals and for misleading members of his own party, who declared him unfit to govern.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Truss was thrown under the bus for gross mismanagement of the economy, but also because it was quickly clear she wasn\u2019t helping her party regain the trust of voters.</span> YouGov said she was the most unpopular prime minister the organization had ever tracked.\nOn Thursday, a day after she told Parliament that she was a \u201cfighter, not a quitter,\u201d Truss met with the powerful chair of <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1922 committee</span></span>, who would have known exactly how many Conservative members of Parliament had issued secret letters of no confidence in her leadership.\nAt <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 16 Conservative</span> lawmakers had gone on the record calling for her to resign, following a chaotic and <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">confusing 24 hours</span>, which saw claims of bullying in Parliament and the resignation of the home secretary and may have been the final straw for the party.\nAmong the discontented was Conservative lawmaker Gary Streeter, who tweeted, \u201cSadly, it seems we must change leader BUT even if the angel Gabriel now takes over, the Parliamentary Party has to urgently rediscover discipline, mutual respect and teamwork if we are to (i) govern the UK well and (ii) avoid slaughter at the next election.\u201d\nIn one impassioned interview Wednesday night, lawmaker Charles Walker spoke frankly about his frustrations. \u201cI\u2019m livid,\u201d he said. \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t say this, but I hope all those people who put Liz Truss in No.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10,</span> I hope it was worth it \u2026 because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.\u201d\nTruss can be held responsible for six weeks of damage.

{"id": "88076", "displayed_text": "<h3>The paradox of Colombia\u2019s peace deal for FARC</h3>HAVANA \u2014 Over four years of peace talks with the Colombian government, the country\u2019s FARC rebels bargained for the best deal possible \u2014 and one that could convince their troops that the past half-century of guerrilla warfare wasn\u2019t for nothing. But in wresting significant concessions from the government, including a launchpad into politics and a chance to skirt prison, the rebels have run the risk of sweetening their deal so much that Colombians won\u2019t stomach it.\nThis was perhaps the key masterstroke of President Juan Manuel Santos\u2019s insistence that the peace deal be contingent on Colombian voter approval. He has set that vote, formally a \u201cplebiscite,\u201d for <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Oct 2.</span> The entire deal is riding on the outcome.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Santos and his negotiating team have long warned Colombians that peace would have a price, as well as a heavy dose of what Colombians call \u201ctoad swallowing,\u201d i.e. bitter medicine.</span> The government insists it has secured the best deal possible with the guerrillas, and with the accords now finalized there will be no chance of making revisions. If voters reject the agreement, the pact crumbles and the war will resume.\n[Here are the details \u2014 critics would say the devils \u2014 in Colombia\u2019s peace deal with FARC]\nFARC commanders were no fans of this strategy. They wanted the deal to be ratified through a more limited consultation process \u2014 a special assembly \u2014 whose outcome would have been more predictable and easier to control. And like many of the peace deal\u2019s supporters, they worry that Santos\u2019s low approval ratings will hurt them at the ballot box.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Yet they have also feathered their beds with significant concessions from the government, guarantees that Santos opponents caricature as a giveaway to FARC \u201cterrorists\u201d who got rich on the drug trade and committed horrible atrocities.</span> Now the guerrillas are ducking punishment and getting a golden parachute into politics, opponents say.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, FARC will be afforded nonvoting representatives in Congress <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">through 2018,</span> where they will be able to weigh in on matters related to the implementation of the accords. Then come the biggest toads: a minimum five seats for FARC in the 106-member Colombian Senate and five more in the 166-member lower chamber for two legislative terms through the creation of new voting districts. FARC, which has yet to reveal the name of its future political party and can\u2019t form one until it fully disarms, will have to compete for seats on its own merits after that.\n[The staggering toll of Colombia\u2019s war with FARC rebels, in numbers]\nOpposition senator Alfredo Rangel called these final concessions by the government \u201cshameful.\u201d\nThe rebels insist this pact is fair, given that so many leftists leaders, including FARC chief negotiator and former congressman Ivan Marquez, were forced out of democratic politics a generation ago by violence. Thousands of members and supporters of the Patriotic Union party, formed by FARC and other Colombian communists, were wiped out in the 1980s and '90s by paramilitary gunmen.\nStill, it will not be hard for the peace deal\u2019s detractors, led by powerful former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, to depict the guarantee <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 unelected</span> legislative seats as an unconscionable freebie. Colombians who know FARC leaders from grainy \u201cwanted\u201d posters and jungle videos may have trouble accepting them as respectable lawmakers.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Another element that could trigger public resentment: Demobilized ex-combatants will receive a monthly government stipend nearly equal to Colombia's minimum wage for a two-year period after the accords.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They will also be eligible for onetime cash payment of <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2,500 </span>-- a significant sum in Colombia -- to start a business.\n</span>[The Colombian peace agreement has a big emphasis on the lives of women. Here\u2019s how.]\nUribe and other opponents of the deal have also attacked it on the grounds that it offers \u201camnesty\u201d to FARC commanders charged with murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking and other crimes. The accords will establish a parallel justice system akin to a truth-and-reconciliation process, wherein guerrillas and members of Colombian security forces and other combatants can serve time at halfway houses, work farms and other alternatives to prison.\nIn his speech Wednesday, Santos seemed hard-pressed to push back, insisting there would be \u201cno immunity\u201d for the worst offenders. \u201cThey will be investigated, judged and sanctioned with several years of restrictions on their freedom. They\u2019ll have to tell the trust \u2014 the whole truth \u2014 and make reparations to their victims,\u201d Santos said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll go to jail for up <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 years</span>.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert, said the justice agreement and FARC\u2019s return to politics are the two biggest points in the peace deal that will be \u201chugely unpopular in Colombia and carry a political cost for Santos.\u201d</span> But he said FARC has arguably given up more in the negotiations, since it scratched much of its wish list items, including land reform, full amnesty and an end to forcible coca eradication.\n\u201cI think the FARC gave some ground when it became clear that too much intransigence would only empower the far right in Colombia,\u201d said Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThey were careful to bend the process, to get what they could, but not break it.\u201d\nOn Oct.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 the</span> government and the rebels will find out whether they found the right balance, or if their accord will die on arrival.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Not Relevant to the U.S. Economy": "6"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}

Avichay Adraee, an Israeli army spokesman, was taken aback when he received a message from a mysterious man writing from the heart of Syria\u2019s bloody civil war.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The man, a Sunni Muslim who created a Facebook page called \u201cJobar Synagogue,\u201d said he was on a mission to preserve his town\u2019s crown jewel, a centuries-old religious site venerated by the three major religions.</span> Merely contacting the Israelis was an act that could have put his life in danger.\n\n\u201cIf we do not move fast to protect this historical heritage, it will be lost forever,\u201d he wrote to the Israeli major, via Facebook.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The exchange last year was part of a frantic mission to rescue the synagogue, located in the battle-worn Damascus suburb of Jobar.</span> The man behind the Facebook page, who uses the nom de guerre Abbas Abu Suleiman, got the attention of rabbis in Israel and New York, Syrian exiles in Washington and a Manhattan diamond-district salesman who visited the synagogue as a boy.\n\nMr. Suleiman hoped the Jewish community would intervene with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad not only to save the site, but to halt the bombardment of his hometown. Safeguarding a part of Syria\u2019s multicultural religious heritage, he hoped, might help the country rebuild whenever the war was over.\n\nMaj. Adraee gets as many <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 18,000 Facebook</span> messages each day, many berating him for Israel\u2019s policies toward its neighbors. After receiving Mr. Suleiman\u2019s plea, he didn\u2019t know what to think. Was this man an ally? An opportunist? He replied to the Facebook message with a question mark.\n\nOthers contacted by Mr. Suleiman had a similar reaction. Jewish leaders on two continents worried about, among other things, whether intervening would endanger the tiny community of aging Jews remaining in Syria.\n\nThis account of Mr. Suleiman\u2019s quest is based on interviews with him on Skype, transcripts of his Facebook chats and discussions with Muslim and Jewish leaders in the U.S., Syria and Israel. Mr. Suleiman asked The Wall Street Journal not to disclose his real name.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Jobar has been part of Jewish life in Syria for centuries.</span> An inscription that for years was part of the synagogue\u2019s wall described it as the shrine of the Prophet Eliyahu Hanavi <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 720 B</span>.C. The synagogue has been rebuilt many times over the years, according to the chief rabbi of the Syrian Jews, Avraham Hamra.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Of Damascus\u2019<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 22 synagogues</span>, the one in Jobar is the most revered because it was built atop a cave where, according to religious teachings, the prophet Eliyahu concealed himself to avoid persecution.</span> Muslims and Christians regard Eliyahu as a prophet, making the site one of the few in Syria revered by all three religions.\n\nBefore the civil war, Jews, Muslims and Christians would visit the synagogue and take turns descending into the cave to pray. Inside was a stone chair believed to have been used by Eliyahu. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Syrians of different faiths believed saying a prayer in the cave would bless a new business venture and safeguard their health, Rabbi Hamra said.\n\n</span>In the early 20th century, an <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 25,000 Jews</span> lived in Syria, split between Damascus and Aleppo, according to Abraham Marcus, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Texas at Austin. The Jews of Syria began to leave in the early 1900s. The exodus accelerated before the founding of Israel <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1948.</span>\n\nToday, Rabbi Hamra said, there <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 17 Jews</span> left in Damascus and probably none in Aleppo, making it Syria\u2019s smallest known religious minority. Nine are men, one short of a minyan, the quorum <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 Jewish</span> male adults required for certain religious obligations. All the Jews in Damascus <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 60 years</span> old or older.\n\nSyria\u2019s Jews have a complex relationship with the Assad regime. Many see him as a protector, and the opposition, dominated by groups aligned with al Qaeda, as the real threat. Government agents monitor the nation\u2019s Jews, according to rabbis and government defectors, which circumscribes what they can do or say.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Suleiman started his quest, Jobar was under the control of opposition forces, as it still is.</span> Groups operating there included the Western-backed Free Syrian Army as well as the Nusra Front, which has ties to al Qaeda. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Jobar and other eastern Damascus suburbs are strategically significant as gateways to the capital, and have seen heavy fighting.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In the security vacuum, thieves in Jobar looted the synagogue, taking prayer books, scrolls and the ornate interior doors, local activists say.</span> On one occasion, members of the FSA rescued some of the stolen items.\n\nLocal activists set up a special committee to protect the synagogue. Mr. Suleiman says he volunteered to take the lead.\n\nIn peaceful times, the synagogue had attracted visitors from Syria and beyond. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">More than just a religious site, it put Jobar on the map.</span> For the sake of the town, residents believed they needed to save it.\n\nBefore the war, Mr. Suleiman had worked as a manager at his family\u2019s factory. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">He had lived in Jobar for his whole life but had never gone inside the synagogue until the summer <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2012,</span> when he decided to help protect it.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Local Jobar leaders locked the doors and posted guards outside.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">On <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 of</span> last year, Mr. Suleiman posted a message, using his Jobar Synagogue account, on the Arabic-language Facebook page of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He explained what leaders in Jobar were doing to secure the site and asked whom they could contact about the antiquities.</span> He got no response.\n\nHe messaged Maj. Adraee, the Israeli Defence Force\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman, later that month. \u201cI tried to connect to many different entities and sources but with no luck,\u201d he said in one message.\n\nNext, he contacted Amine Helwani, one of Damascus\u2019<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 17 remaining</span> Jews. Mr. Helwani and his brother used to visit the synagogue to make sure everything was in order, according to Rabbi Hamra.\n\nMr. Helwani replied in a series of Facebook messages. He said the war prevented anyone making the drive across town. He asked about an old Torah scroll and about the condition of the rugs.\n\nMr. Suleiman said he couldn\u2019t find the Torah scroll, and that he had rolled up the rugs to protect them.\n\n\u201cMay God protect you and guide you,\u201d Mr. Helwani wrote back. He said the Jews in Damascus were in no position to help because of the constant fighting. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. Mr. Helwani didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Helwani found one way to keep the effort rolling. He reached out to Henry Hamra, nephew of the Syrian chief rabbi, who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan\u2019s diamond district. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hamra had visited Jobar as a child growing up in Damascus.\n\n</span>\u201cHi. How are you? My name is Henry Hamra,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Suleiman via Skype in July of last year. He thanked Mr. Suleiman for taking care of the synagogue. \u201cYou are doing the best thing anybody could do without getting a reward,\u201d he wrote. He suggested that Mr. Suleiman secure the religious items away from the synagogue.\n\nHe asked Mr. Suleiman to send pictures. One showed prayer books and two Torah scrolls in boxes. Another showed the synagogue after it was cleared out. Mr. Suleiman said he needed help\u2014trucks and other equipment to protect the perimeter.\n\nMr. Hamra recalls that he wasn\u2019t sure how to proceed. He contacted his uncle, the chief Syrian rabbi, who now lives in Holon, a working-class suburb near Tel Aviv. Rabbi Hamra cautioned his nephew against intervening. The first priority was to protect the remaining Jews in Damascus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want one fingernail of anyone to be hurt. I don\u2019t want that. If I will deal with the opposition, then the government won\u2019t forgive,\u201d Rabbi Hamra recalls advising his nephew. \u201cI will not speak against Assad and I will not speak against the opposition. I stand by the Jews of Syria.\u201d\n\nMr. Hamra kept talking to Mr. Suleiman. They exchanged pictures of their young children. Mr. Hamra hoped to one day visit the synagogue with his children. When the two men talked, usually over a Skype connection, explosions and the sound of children playing could be heard in the background.\n\nIsraeli Maj. Adraee hadn\u2019t responded to Mr. Suleiman when he wrote again in July of last year to say that \u201cif the people of the house don\u2019t want to protect their homes, then I have come to a dead end and I can no longer continue protecting the synagogue.\u201d\n\nMaj. Adraee wrote back: \u201c?\u201d\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner says Maj. Adraee sometimes responds with a question mark if he wants further context or explanation. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe efforts of the residents of Jobar are honorable and we certainly hope to see the appropriate organizations and bodies act on their behalf,\u201d Lt. Col. Lerner says.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The following month, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 2013,</span> the Assad regime launched what the U.S. and its allies called a large chemical-weapons attack, devastating Jobar and other nearby suburbs.</span> Mr. Suleiman says many local residents were killed, including members of his family.\n\nWhen Mr. Hamra heard the news in New York, he sent frantic messages. Mr. Suleiman responded a few days later. Mr. Suleiman sent pictures of victims of the gas attack and told him to get the word out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell him,\u201d Mr. Hamra recalls.\n\nTheir talks about lobbying and providing trucks and other equipment were going nowhere. Both men say their relations grew strained.\n\nMouaz Moustafa, an antiregime activist based in Washington, was introduced to Mr. Suleiman by a mutual acquaintance in the opposition movement. Mr. Moustafa, a Syrian of Palestinian origin, says he felt conflicted. Although his work put him in frequent contact with American officials and Jewish leaders, he didn\u2019t want to be seen as working with the Israelis because that could hurt his relations with opposition activists.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He decided to approach Jewish leaders in New York, who he thought could help persuade Mr. Assad to ease the stranglehold on Jobar.</span> In the back of his mind, he says, was the distant prospect of engineering a prisoner swap that would free activists, women and children imprisoned by the regime.\n\nThe first meeting was with Rabbi Elie Abadie, whose family was from Aleppo and who now runs Congregation Edmond J. Safra in Manhattan. Mr. Moustafa had met rabbis before but never one who spoke Arabic and who shared his love of Fairuz, a Lebanese singer.\n\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Rabbi Abadie was intrigued but wasn\u2019t sure \u201chow much to trust the people in Jobar,\u201d he recalls.</span> He too believed it was more important to protect the remaining Jews in Damascus.\n\nRabbi Abadie looked at pictures Mr. Suleiman had sent. He estimated the prayer books were maybe two centuries old. Other pictures showed Torah scrolls, one of which was so badly damaged that Rabbi Abadie thought it was no longer usable and should be buried, per Jewish custom.\n\nThe next stop in New York for Mr. Moustafa was Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Mr. Hoenlein had visited Syria <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 to</span> try to preserve Jewish sites and had met with Mr. Assad. He says he was skeptical of Mr. Suleiman\u2019s requests for money and his ability to save the synagogue and its contents. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">He checked with contacts in Syria, who told him Jobar was largely impassable and in the hands of competing rebel units.\n\n</span>\u201cThere was a lot of suspicion and mistrust,\u201d says Marty Kalin, a Jewish American alarmed by the humanitarian crisis in Syria who accompanied Mr. Moustafa in New York.\n\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hoenlein recalls that he and other Jewish leaders wanted to help but didn\u2019t know whether Jobar residents could deliver on their promises to protect the synagogue.</span> They reached a consensus soon after: The risk of intervening was too high.\n\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hoenlein says he worried that providing financial assistance to Jobar might prompt opposition forces in other parts of Syria to seek similar deals to protect other Jewish sites.\n\n</span>Rabbi Abadie was disappointed with the result but agreed with the decision. \u201cI am a Jew, but I realized that plenty of churches have been destroyed, plenty of mosques have been destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I felt, \u2018With what right could I scream foul play while other houses of worship have been destroyed equally?\u2019 \u201d\n\nA few weeks later, Rabbi Abadie was invited to an exhibit in New York of \u201cimportant Judaica\u201d put together by the auction house Sotheby\u2019s. As he toured the exhibit, he noticed a wood carving from a Syrian synagogue with an inlaid ebony-and-bone border. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The Sotheby\u2019s catalog said: \u201cThis rare surviving artifact of the Jewish community at Jobar may be all that remains of this ancient and venerable community.\u201d\n\nRabbi Abadie asked the curator to remove the item so he could examine it.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">He assumed Jobar\u2019s residents were selling off looted antiquities.</span> \u201cOh, my goodness. These guys really are quick!\u2019\u201d he recalls thinking.\n\nThe curator checked the item\u2019s notes. It had been taken from the synagogue in the early 1900s.\n\nIn the spring of this year, a rocket hit the back of the synagogue, punching a hole in the wall. Mr. Suleiman posted another message on Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Facebook page: \u201cIt seems like this issue means nothing to you all.\u201d\n\nIn May, the synagogue took a direct hit from a shell. The damage was catastrophic.\n\nRabbi Hamra, who was at home in Holon when he heard the news, compares it to the destruction of the ancient temple in Jerusalem. \u201cIt felt like the world was destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had such a special place in the world. But what could I do?\u201d\n\nMr. Hoenlein says he is skeptical much survived the strike.\n\nMr. Suleiman says local residents went through the rubble and salvaged what they could. The cave, he says, is still intact. The safe house where the religious items were stored was hit by rockets. One of the scrolls was burned but most of the prayer books and other religious items were saved.\n\nMr. Suleiman posted pictures of the destroyed stone building on the synagogue\u2019s Facebook page and sent a message to Mr. Netanyahu that linked to pictures of the rubble.\n\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">He wrote: \u201cThe end of the Jobar synagogue at the hands of Bashar al-Assad.\u201d\n\nWrite to Adam Entous at adam.entous@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}

Penney\u2019s corporate headquarters in Plano, Tex., and surveyed its employees gathered above and below him.</span> Microphone in hand, he bellowed: \u201cMy people!\u201d\nMr. Richie is a four-time Grammy winner, with <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 100 million</span> records sold, so he counts a lot of people as \u201chis\u201d people. Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers danced with him during his \u201cBrick House\u201d days with the Commodores, then swayed to his \u201cEndless Love\u201d serenades when he went solo. Younger fans may know him as a judge on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d or as father to Nicole, Miles and Sofia.\nNow, he has the undivided attention of a new fan: J.C. Penney, the struggling department store where Mr. Richie is introducing his new home goods collection.\nThat\u2019s right. Lionel Richie, the 69-year-old multiplatinum singer-songwriter, is debuting a line of sheets and towels, which will be available in stores beginning Sept.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7.</span> With his entourage and a camera crew in tow, he made a three-hour stop at the J.C. Penney campus, where he tried to excite the sellers of his black satin comforters and gold-embroidered pillowcases by, among other things, handing out two bouquets of roses and crashing a meeting of the board of directors.\nThe grand finale was the gathering in the rotunda. As the initial applause and cheers died down, Mr. Richie leaned on the wooden railing and shook his head, almost laughing.\n\u201cThis is absolutely insanity,\u201d he said.\nWhich is what you may be thinking, too. An explanation is forthcoming, but first the puns: Hello, is it zzzs you\u2019re looking for? After a night of Dancing on the Ceiling, you can climb under this comforter and sleep All Night Long. Mr. Richie, once a Penny Lover is now a Penneys lover \u2014 and he\u2019s coming for your linen closet.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the bedroom,\u201d Mr. Richie said, referring to his many romantic songs. \u201cAt least use my sheets.\u201d\nCelebrities sell stuff because it works.\nTo understand how we got to a place where we could collectively climb into bed with Lionel Richie, consider the threadbare, well-worn path of celebrity merchandising. Many stars have product lines; some simply license their names, while others are intimately involved in design.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Stores often demand the right to exclusively sell these product lines in order to ensure a lock on each celebrity\u2019s fan base.\n</span>Pop stars tend to gravitate toward creating their own clothing and accessories lines, where a few oft-cited individuals have had considerable success (see: Jessica Simpson and Victoria Beckham).\nHome goods make sense for the Rachael Rays and Martha Stewarts of the world, but it is something of a new frontier for musicians, and a strategic one. The category attracts a broader customer base, with looser ties to age or a gender, and presents much less fashion risk. A set of sheets can sit on a store shelf for months. A strong-selling towel can stick around for years.\nFacing declines in traffic, department stores like J.C. Penney are betting on star power to attract shoppers. Before hitting the sheets with Mr. Richie, J.C. Penney carried bedding collections from the actress Eva Longoria and the model Cindy Crawford. It also plans to sell bedding by Ayesha Curry, a foodie and the wife of the N.B.A. player Stephen Curry, this fall.\nThe store is especially excited about Mr. Richie\u2019s line, which will be manufactured by Sobel Westex, the Las Vegas-based textile manufacturer behind Sleep Like a King, the bedding collection by Larry King and his wife, Shawn.\nExecutives see a strong correlation between the core J.C. Penney shopper \u2014 a woman over the age <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 45 </span>\u2014 and Mr. Richie. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">His E-Score, a ranking of a celebrity\u2019s marketability from E-Poll Market Research, is a near-<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">perfect 98 out</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100.</span></span> Nine out <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 people</span> over the age <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 55 recognized</span> his name, <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97 percent</span> said they liked him.\nAmong the top attributes women assigned to him were \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cgood energy.\u201d It\u2019s not far off from Mr. Richie\u2019s own sense of his brand, which he says is love. To guys, he is a musical wingman; to ladies, a swoony crooner.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">J.C. Penney could use some good energy after its most recent earnings report, which sent its stock plunging.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Katheryn Burchett, the chain\u2019s senior vice president of merchandising for home, said Mr. Richie\u2019s collection fills an aesthetic void in its assortment, pointing to the already strong online sales for the black-and-gold satin-like three-piece comforter set, on sale <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $149.99.</span>\n</span>\u201cWe really want to reach out to his fans that may not have been in a J.C. Penney store for a while and get them to come in,\u201d Ms. Burchett said.\nLionel Richie loves home goods. Don\u2019t act so surprised.\nIf you\u2019re still thinking, \u201cHome goods? Really?\u201d that\u2019s O.K. Mr. Richie\u2019s friends have said the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m actually enjoying this,\u201d he said.\nFrom an ornate sitting room in his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., Mr. Richie explained it further. \u201cI was desperately trying to get the next hit record,\u201d he said, when he reached a point of wanting something new, an additional outlet for his creative energy.\nHe had his team reach out to Walter Pelaez, the chief executive of Sobel, and they had dinner together at Mr. Richie\u2019s house on Valentine\u2019s Day <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span> There, \u201cthe magic started,\u201d Mr. Pelaez recalled. They spent all night long \u2014 just kidding, it was more like several hours \u2014 talking through the possibilities.\nCelebrities are infusing the otherwise stale design landscape with a much-needed newness, Mr. Pelaez said, so he came to Mr. Richie\u2019s house already intent on sealing the deal. For a musician to be thought of, his or her song has to be playing on the radio \u2014 a fleeting moment.\nBut sheets and towels are a permanent reminder, a particularly intimate connection. \u201cIt\u2019s in your bedroom, it\u2019s in your bathroom, it\u2019s touching your body,\u201d Mr. Pelaez said.\nMr. Richie said that interior design has been a hobby of his since he bought his home two decades ago. He performs <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 70 live</span> shows around the world each year and takes respite from the road by decorating his own space.\nHe collects sizable souvenirs from his travels, like the piece of the Berlin Wall in his backyard. Now, those same adventures inform his product design.\nThe J.C. Penney bed and bath line is the beginning of what Mr. Richie sees as a much bigger lifestyle brand, Lionel Richie Home, with more categories to come. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s his second attempt in home goods; <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 he</span> hosted a dinner party to introduce a higher-priced offering of glassware and china.\n</span>That collection had limited distribution, according to a spokesman. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The concept will be reimagined at more affordable prices in the future.\n</span>\u201cI happen to stand every night in front of my customer. It\u2019s called my fans,\u201d Mr. Richie said. He appeals to people looking for quality and value. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Their questions are practical: \u201cHow much is it going to cost?\u201d and \u201cIs it going to last after the third washing?\u201d\nHis current line will be merchandised alongside color-coordinated pieces from J.C. Penney\u2019s own label.</span> If a shopper buys a Lionel Richie Home six-piece white-and-black towel set, on sale <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $39.99,</span> she could pick up a few solid black towels from J.C. Penney\u2019s line to coordinate. The intermingling of brands was intentional: It ensures both parties are invested in the success of the other.\nThe in-store setup that will be featured <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 250 locations</span> includes three photos of Mr. Richie: a head shot over each of the display beds and \u2014 the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2014 a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Richie standing between the two. The hope is that shoppers will see it as a selfie moment.\nMr. Richie certainly did. During his visit to J.C. Penney headquarters, he jumped on stage unprompted to pose for pictures with his cardboard self. Later, in the rotunda, Mr. Richie declared that he would change the way people think about selling. \u201cThe only way to do that is you have to do something slightly ridiculous,\u201d he said.\nIt always helps to have a sense of humor.\nIndeed, rather than run from the jokes, Mr. Richie joins them. The merchandise booth in Las Vegas, where Mr. Richie has a residency at Planet Hollywood until October, for example, sells mugs that read, \u201cHello, is it tea you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\nIt\u2019s funny, and serves a purpose. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">At the J.C. Penney headquarters, when an employee inquired about his dinner plans, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell a lot of sheets and pillowcases with that attitude right there, my dear.\u201d\n</span>\u201cIn life, there\u2019s only one great bridge to the other side,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cThat is a sense of humor.\u201d He sees it as a path toward relevance, and relevance as an alternative to retirement.\nThis fandom keeps him in the mix, Mr. Richie added, rattling off the admirers he often hears about: \u201cMy mama, my daddy, my cousin, my brother, my sister, my aunt loves you.\u201d That fan base has to translate, he said. \u201cSomebody is going to buy a towel and hopefully a sheet.\u201d\n\u201cI would buy anything for Lionel Richie,\u201d said Lisa Stewart, a 49-year-old mother of three from Lexington, Ky, who was attending Mr. Richie\u2019s Las Vegas concert one Saturday evening. She had already shelled out hundreds of dollars for V.I.P. passes in celebration of her coming birthday.\nAlthough she is a lifelong J.C. Penney shopper \u2014 her husband was wearing pants from the chain to the concert \u2014 Ms. Stewart had not heard of Mr. Richie\u2019s bedding line. The possibility excited her. (Later, in an email, she said she saw pieces online and loved them all.)\nOn this particular summer night, Ms. Stewart was part of a crowd that drew people from San Diego and San Antonio, Illinois and Arkansas. For a little less than two hours, a few thousand people stood, if and when they were able, swaying and smiling.\nMr. Richie is a performer as much as he is a singer, cracking dad jokes in between his tried-and-true songs. \u201cThere\u2019s a portion of your life when you realize that you got more years behind you than you do in front of you, so you\u2019re not ashamed,\u201d he said, taking a beat as the crowd laughed, \u201cof telling your children, \u2018Just get out of my face for a minute.\u2019\u201d\nAt another point, he pretended that a drink that was handed to him by a crew member was filled with something strong. (It was Pedialyte).\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Around 10 p</span>.m., after \u201cEasy (Like Sunday Morning),\u201d \u201cWe are the World\u201d and every other Lionel Richie song you maybe forgot he sang, the show was over. He walked offstage, shed his blue sequined \u201cAll Night Long\u201d jacket and climbed into a black S.U.V., waiting to take him to his private plane.\nLionel Richie was going home to sleep in his own bed.\nAdvertisement", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Not Relevant to the U.S. Economy": "6"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}

I immediately said, 'Flight we're going to alarm.' Neil, who never says anything during the critical phase, says 'Houston, give me a reading <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on 1202.</span>' And Charlie Duke, who may have saved the mission, doesn't wait and tells the crew to go on the alarm. It was telling us the computer had too much to do, sending hundreds of signals at a time and that's why we got <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1202 alarm</span>.\"\nFrom there, all seemed quiet, with Bales thinking that the mission was \"home free\" on the 20th as the Eagle lander got down to <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 7,000 feet</span>. <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">But 8 minutes</span> into a process that took <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately 12.5 minutes</span>, NASA got another alarm.\n\"We're so close now that there's a chance they might not be able to land manually,\" Bales said. \"Bob Carlton, who <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 10 years</span> older than me, said there was no fuel gauge on the vehicle, only a sensor that was getting low. When the light went on, there <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were 90 seconds</span> of fuel left, so he [Carlton] started a stopwatch and the program is resting on a guy with a stopwatch. The ground [Charlie Duke[ called <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">out 60 seconds</span> and at the time, we saw the vehicle shooting out across the Moon and Neil was going over football-field-sized craters. Thirty seconds and then a few seconds later, we heard touchdown and then tranquility base. And that's when we had to get ready.\"\n'THERE WAS A BIT OF TENSION' ASTRONAUT DESCRIBES WATCHING MOON LANDING WITH BUZZ ALDRIN'S FAMILY\nNo one could fault anyone NASA for celebrating the monumental achievement with a sip of alcohol or two, but that was not the case \u2014 at least not until later.\n\"We had what we called a state of the state a few minutes after they landed to make sure they were OK on the surface,\" Griffin said. \"We didn't celebrate at touchdown, there was too much left to do.\"\nBut when the crew landed back on Earth, the room got pretty crazy \u2014 cigars were smoked, flags were waved,\" Griffin added, noting that they later went to a local bar and had a beer bust. \"It was a crazy time.\"\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Now 50 years</span> later, America is preparing to return to the Moon <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2024,</span> and eventually, to Mars.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many of the men and women who worked on <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Apollo 11,</span></span></span> it was a job, one that came with enormous responsibility and pressure.</span> In the moment, it was difficult to comprehend what actually happened. \"No one joined the astronaut core to be a hero,\" Duke said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"We stay focused on our jobs.</span> It's humbling on one hand and very satisfying on the other, but I don't wear a badge that says 'hero.'\"\nIt wasn't until later, in some cases a few minutes, and in others, much, much later, that the impact was felt.\n\"After our debriefing, I walked out to my car, stuck the keys into the ignition and I couldn't start the car,\" Ahr said. \"That's when it hit me when I realized what we had done.

Federal Reserve said it would buy short-term Treasury debt beginning next week to avoid a recurrence of the unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month.\n</span><span id=\"1\"

those purchases into the second quarter <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020.</span>\n</span>The announcement Friday marked a U-turn for the central bank, which until August had been shrinking its <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $4 trillion</span></span> asset portfolio.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Fed said the actions were \u201cpurely technical measures to support the effective implementation\u201d of the rate-setting committee\u2019s policy \u201cand do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Fed officials stopped shrinking the assets on their balance sheet this summer but never said when they would allow them to grow again.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">As a result, a crucial liability on the balance sheet\u2014bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves\u2014has continued to decline.\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks had grown reluctant to lend those reserves and that the Fed may have let them to fall too low.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span> last month, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Fed said its goal will be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system to levels of <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $1.5 trillion</span> that prevailed in early September.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is a much needed bazooka from the Fed,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates at Bank of</span> America Corp. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt shows the Fed is finally doing what is necessary to correct their mistake from dropping reserves too low.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Newsletter Sign-up\nChanges in how the Fed administers its rate decisions and in bank regulation earlier this decade, along with increased government debt issuance over the past year, have made it harder for the Fed to determine how many reserves it could drain from the system.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of time where the Fed and others are in a learning-by-doing mode,\u201d said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at financial-services company Jefferies LLC.</span> \u201cThey have been making the right adjustments and, just as important, they are being very transparent about it.\u201d\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the announcement in a speech Tuesday.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the Fed\u2019s funding plan would be designed to maintain a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates and not to provide economic stimulus.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed bought longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive stimulus campaigns <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 that</span> became known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said Tuesday. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, officials will instead buy shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee met by videoconference on Oct.<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 to</span> discuss recent developments in money markets.</span> It approved the plans unanimously on Friday.\nThe committee last met on Sept. 17-18, as the spike in overnight funding markets occurred.

{"id": "38734", "displayed_text": "<h3>Watching inflation like a hawk, the Fed might start to cut its economic aid.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Watching inflation like a hawk, the Fed might start to cut its economic aid.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, signaled on Tuesday that the central bank was growing more concerned about high \u2014 and stubborn \u2014 inflation, and could speed up its plan to withdraw financial support from the economy as it tries to ensure that rapid price gains do not become long-lasting.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell, whom President Biden plans to renominate for a second term, testified before the Senate Banking Committee at a fraught economic moment.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Inflation has jumped to its highest level in three decades and a new coronavirus variant, Omicron, threatens to keep the economy from returning to normal, potentially dragging out supply and demand mismatches.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Yet millions of workers are still missing from the job market \u2014 and the health threat could keep them on the sidelines.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">As arguably the nation\u2019s most important economic policymaker</span>, Mr. Powell must navigate that divide. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">His comments Tuesday suggested that he was preparing to do it with an eye more firmly focused on the threat of inflation.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">That could mean ending the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program sooner than expected.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The central bank had been <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buying $120 billion</span> in government-backed securities each month throughout much of the pandemic to bolster the economy by keeping money flowing in financial markets.</span> In November, officials announced plans to slow those purchases <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by $15 billion</span> a month, which would have the program ending midway <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">through 2022.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Powell said the central bank could wrap up more quickly, reducing the amount of economic juice the Fed is adding.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong, and inflationary pressures are high,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cIt is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner.\u201d\nHis comments further rattled investors, who had already been fretting about Omicron\u2019s potential impact. Stocks, which had been down <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 0.5 percent</span> for much of the morning, tumbled after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments and the S&P closed <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 1.9 percent</span>. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Short-term bond yields, which are heavily influenced by expectations for Fed rate increases, spiked as investors began to expect what is sometimes referred to as a \u201chawkish,\u201d or aggressive approach to interest rate policy.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe tone of his remarks was notably hawkish, suggesting that the Fed\u2019s primary focus is on the risk of more persistent excess inflation,\u201d Krishna Guha, an economist at Evercore ISI, wrote in a research note reacting to the testimony.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said he expected Fed officials to discuss slowing bond purchases faster \u201cat our upcoming meeting,\u201d which is scheduled for Dec. 14-15.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">He stressed that between now and then, policymakers will get a better sense of the new Omicron virus variant, a fresh labor market report and updated inflation numbers.\n</span>While he emphasized that much is unknown about Omicron, he said experts could get a better sense of it \u201cin about a month,\u201d and will know at least something about the risks \u201cwithin a week <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 10 days</span>.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">For now, he focused on the risk the central bank has already come to know: rapid price gains.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Inflation is running at its fastest pace since the early 1990s in the United States, and prices have picked up in Europe and across many other advanced economies as booming consumer demand runs into sharply constrained supply.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In the eurozone, annual inflation jumped <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.9 percent</span>, according to data released Tuesday, the highest since records began <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1997.</span></span> Global factory shutdowns, clogged ports and unusual shipping patterns have driven shortages in couches, cars and computer chips.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Fed officials had for months predicted that the snarls would clear and price gains would fade.</span> Instead, they have broadened \u2014 and that has made central bankers like Mr. Powell increasingly worried.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cGenerally, the higher prices we\u2019re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it\u2019s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,\u201d Mr. Powell said Tuesday.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">\u201cI think the risk of higher inflation has increased.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Monetary policymakers had spent recent months focused on helping the economy to heal, hoping to pull the millions of workers still missing from the job market back into work.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">To that end, the Fed\u2019s policy interest rate, its more traditional and more powerful tool, has remained set to near zero.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Officials had been stressing that they would be patient in pulling back that support and cooling down the economy, giving missing employees more time to return.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But their tone appears to be shifting as prices for food, rent and goods are jumping.\n</span>Slowing bond purchases quickly would put officials in a position to raise borrowing costs sooner than previously forecast. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Lifting interest rates earlier or faster would pump the economic brakes, helping to slow home-building, business expansions and consumer spending.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Weakening demand would in turn help to weigh down prices over time.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">By trying to rein in price increases, the Fed would probably slow hiring.</span> Doing so could be painful while people still remain out of work partly out of virus fears or a lack of child care.\nThat\u2019s why Omicron could pose such a big challenge. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">If the new variant shuts down factories and slows shipping routes while keeping would-be job applicants at home, it could put the Fed in a tough spot.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Central bank policymakers are supposed to foster both full employment and keep prices stable, and such a situation would force them to choose between those goals.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell\u2019s willingness to pull back support faster despite the new variant \u2014 and his full-throated recognition that price gains are not poised to be as short-lived as officials had once hoped \u2014 caught investors\u2019 attention.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Understand the Supply Chain Crisis\nCovid\u2019s impact on the supply chain continues.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain and made all kinds of products harder to find.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">In turn, scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher as inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe Fed is the ultimate owner of the \u2018transitory\u2019 characterization, and the chair\u2019s decision to move beyond that is a decidedly hawkish step,\u201d wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, in a note to clients shortly after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">At one point, Mr. Powell even said that at \u201ccoming meetings\u201d he expected the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee would say that when it comes to inflation, its standard for lifting interest rates had been met.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">That would mean that central bankers would simply be looking to the job market as they weighed when, whether and how much to raise borrowing costs.\n</span>For Mr. Powell, the timing is complicated. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">The Biden administration announced last week that it would renominate him as chair of the Fed, and that it would elevate Lael Brainard \u2014 now a governor \u2014 as the central bank\u2019s vice chair.</span> Both await Senate confirmation.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Inflation is factoring into the political moment, as well, as Republicans try to pin high inflation on the Biden administration and its policies.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Several Republican senators asked combative questions of Mr. Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen during their joint testimony on Tuesday, at times trying to back them into blaming rapidly rising prices on Mr. Biden\u2019s policies.\nDemocrats, furthermore, are working to pass <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $2.2 trillion</span> climate change and social policy bill before the end of the year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen defended the Biden administration\u2019s economic agenda, insisting that the policies were fiscally responsible and that they would reduce costs for families.\n</span>\u201cThe Build Back Better plan contains support for households to help address some of the most burdensome and most rapidly rising costs that they face,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, pointing to proposals to make preschool free, provide expanded care for the elderly and increase education subsidies.\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Republicans, who four years ago <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passed $1.5 trillion</span> in tax cuts that went mostly to the rich, assailed the spending proposals as reckless.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen insisted that tax increases and an investment in the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that people and companies are paying the taxes they owe would prevent the legislation from adding to the debt.\n</span>\u201cIt is fully paid for, or even more than fully paid for,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Others criticized the administration and Fed\u2019s response to the virus and the risk that it posed, saying policymakers needed to accept that the disease would be around for a long time and should not react every time a new strain appeared.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cAt what point do we just get back to a more normal execution of Fed policy?\u201d</span> Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, asked Mr. Powell.\n\u201cWe have to be humble about our ability to predict this, or really understand,\u201d Mr. Powell replied, after saying that the central bank did not expect the new variant to have fallout that is \u201cremotely comparable\u201d to the initial pandemic-spurred state and local lockdowns.\nMatt Phillips contributed reporting.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996,</span> in need of a challenge and a boost to his business skills, Mr. Dupee enrolled in a joint MBA/JD program at Georgetown University.</span> \"Everyone at Green Mountain thought I'd take my law degree and work for the ACLU,\" he says. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Instead, he landed a job with the distressed-assets group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The group was responsible for searching distressed credit-card, small-business and mortgage debt for salvageable investments to buy and pool together.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Initially, Mr. Dupee's excitement about living in New York, landing a coveted job and working on multimillion-dollar deals buoyed him.</span> But over time, he says, he began to have doubts about his career path. \"It felt like there was something I should be doing that I wasn't.\"\n\nFor a while he used his sizable paycheck to pursue distractions from his career. He bought tickets to Yankee games and rock concerts, took sailing lessons and skied in the winter. But, in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2003,</span> three years after joining Goldman, Mr. Dupee decided he needed to make a fundamental change. At work, his team was broken up and re-assigned. He wasn't sure the opportunities he wanted would exist going forward. Meanwhile, work-related stress prevented him from sleeping and he began to worry about his health.\n\nRobert Koes, a fellow Wall Streeter and Mr. Dupee's then-roommate, wasn't surprised. \"I think he wanted to prove that he could succeed [at a firm like Goldman], which he did, but he was never that into it,\" Mr. Koes says.\n\nIn <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2004,</span> Mr. Dupee went home to Vermont to visit his parents and brought a copy of his r&eacute;sum&eacute; along. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\"I told myself I wasn't job hunting; I was just connecting with people in my network.\"</span> A friend there suggested that Mr. Dupee get in touch with Robert Stiller, the founder and then chief executive of Green Mountain.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Back in New York, sitting at a Goldman trading desk, Mr. Dupee got a call from Mr. Stiller, who told him about a position he wanted to create -- a corporate social-responsibility officer who would be the nexus for efforts, including fair-trade coffee, environmental programs and community activism.</span> \"This part of my brain that hadn't been tapped in eight years started to wake up,\" he says. \"I hadn't talked to a dreamer, which is what [Mr. Stiller] is, in years, and it felt really good.\"\n\nHe took the offer, pay cut and all, and moved back to Vermont. But he no longer works insane hours and now feels his work is in keeping with his values and interests.\n\nIt wasn't an entirely easy transition, as Mr. Dupee had to come up to speed on an emerging profession. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That meant figuring out what sorts of efforts are realistic to accomplish, how to work with people in other parts of the business to get those things done and how to measure success.</span> Even though he has returned to his roots, Mr. Dupee says his graduate degrees and prior experience have served him well. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He says that in school and at Goldman, he learned how to navigate office politics, \"speak the language of business\" and to frame environmental or energy-saving initiatives in terms of savings and profits.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">For his part, Mr. Koes isn't surprised that his friend feels at home in his new job.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"At the end of the day, he could have gotten a degree in 17th-century French literature and ultimately would have found this same job,\" he says.\n\n</span>87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Personal [articles focused on an individual or small group of individuals]": "4"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
{"id": "93473", "displayed_text": "<h3>Trump, Ryan say they are \u2018totally committed\u2019 to uniting their party</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan struck a conciliatory tone after meeting in Washington Thursday, seeking to ease tensions that flared last week when Ryan said he is not ready to endorse the business mogul in his bid for the White House.\n</span>\u201cWhile we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,\u201d Trump and Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a joint statement shortly after their meeting at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there\u2019s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal.\u201d\nDespite the positive tone of the statement, Ryan is still not committing to supporting Trump as the party\u2019s nominee, although he said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by their conversation Thursday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today,\u201d he told reporters on Capitol Hill later in the morning. \u201cThe question is what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings of the party. It was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together.\u201d\nRyan said the next step is to drill down on policy differences to find commonalities, adding that their \u201cpolicy teams\u201d were going to meet to \u201cwork through the details.\u201d\n\u201cGoing forward we\u2019re going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds to make sure we have a better understanding of one another,\u201d he said.\nRyan called unifying the party \u201ca process\u201d and said it would \u201ctake some time\u201d before it comes together.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to have a fake unification process here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that we really and truly understand each other.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s face-to-face with Ryan was the first of several high-profile sit downs with Republican leaders that come as the campaign seeks to unite the party \u2014 and its resources \u2014 ahead of a competitive general election. The speaker described the meeting with the former reality TV star, who he admitted he doesn\u2019t know very well, as a \u201cpleasant exchange.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very warm and genuine person\u2026we really don\u2019t know each other and we started to get to know each other,\u201d Ryan said.\nThe summit between Ryan and Trump was cast as an opportunity to soothe tensions between Trump and the GOP establishment at a pivotal moment for a party sharply divided over the likely nominee\u2019s unorthodox and controversial campaign.\nThe day of meetings began <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9 a</span>.m. when Trump met with Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, after which he met with the full House GOP leadership team.\nShortly <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 10 a</span>.m., Priebus tweeted out that the meeting was \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\u201cThey had very good chemistry between the two of them,\u201d he said later on CNN. \u201cIt was positive and it was give and take. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">If anyone was a fly on the wall, they would agree with what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that during their meeting with Trump, House leaders ran through a long list of policy issues, including the national debt, foreign affairs and issues of particular concern to the lawmakers in the room.</span> McCarthy, for example, brought up California\u2019s water crisis.\nBoth McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said they thought there was plenty of room for agreement with Trump.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">McCarthy noted House Republicans are working on a series of policy proposals they can take to voters this fall and said they specifically discussed their work on tax reform \u2014 an issue Trump has highlighted.\n</span>\u201cI think when you talk about ideas, you talk about vision, that\u2019s a perfect place for people to unite,\u201d he said.\nMcCarthy said other topics raised, included veterans\u2019 issues and \u201cthe overreach of agencies.\u201d\nTrump left the RNC shortly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 11 a</span>.m., waving at reporters from the back seat of his black suburban as he headed to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his top associates.\nIn the roughly 75-minute meeting with Senate Republican leadership, Trump listened as the senators took their turns raising issues of concern that had come up in his raucous campaign.\nAccording to more than a half-dozen participants, the meeting was cordial and lacked any of the tension from the previous huddle with Ryan\u2019s team as none of those senators had expressed the same reservations as the House speaker.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) raised policy concerns and while she declined to specify which ones, Trump\u2019s positions on taxes, trade and entitlement programs have so far all run counter to where a majority of Senate Republicans stand.\n</span>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No.<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 in</span> GOP leadership, told reporters he raised \u201cthe issue of tone\u201d in relation to how the candidate could better attract Latino voters. This has been a major concern for Republicans in Washington, who fear that Trump\u2019s antagonistic statements \u2013 he labeled Mexicans who come across the border as \u201crapists\u201d the day he launched his campaign a year ago \u2013 will drive Hispanic voters deeper into the Democratic column and make it impossible to win a national campaign.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to share with you my experience and observations, because obviously that\u2019s an important part of the voters <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span>\u201d Cornyn said he told Trump, noting that he won a majority of Latino voters in Texas during <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 re</span>-election contest.\nAdditionally, the Senate leaders talked brass tacks about their campaigns ahead and agreed that in some cases Republicans are going to run away from Trump and his proposals.\n\u201cHe looked forward to being helpful where he could,\u201d Cornyn said, noting that some states might be more amenable to Trump policies. \u201cHe also understands that some places, people may choose to run independently and not join up with the presidential.\u201d\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans seeking reelection this year, said \u201cit was a good listening session \u2013 it really was, on both sides.\u201d\nPortman flatly rejected any speculation he would want to be Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\u201cNo,\u201d was his quick response when asked by a reporter.\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the most senior Senate Republican, was the most enthusiastic about the meeting.\n\u201cYes, I totally endorse him,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cWe want him to win and we want him to be the next president.\u201d\nHe waved off reporters\u2019 questions about whether Trump was on board with House and Senate Republicans\u2019 agenda by pointing out that the discussion only lasted an hour.\n\u201cThere were naturally questions raised that you might call criticism, but he handled them very well,\u201d Hatch said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very, very bright guy,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good guy.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s trip to Washington became a spectacle in and of itself.\nThe streets outside Republican National Committee headquarters assumed a circus-like atmosphere Thursday morning with dozens of cameras staked out every entrance to the building, satellite trucks lined the nearby streets and passersby gawked at the spectacle.\n[A fake Trump, a bagpiper and a guy with a ram\u2019s horn meet on the sidewalk\u2026]\nAt one point, a man wearing a portable megaphone and a papier mache Trump head walked down First Street SE carrying a brown paper sack with a dollar sign on it.\n\u201cThe Donald has spoken, and the GOP is listening!\u201d he shouted as photographers swarmed around him.\nAs he shook his bags of money and made campaign promises like giving all women free manicures and pedicures, Trump supporter Johnny Rice stood in front of him with a mega-horn and sang religious songs in an attempt to drown out the protester. He then switched to sounding a ram\u2019s horn that he bought on eBay.\n\u201cOkay: Believe in spiritual or don\u2019t believe in spiritual, God spoke to me and said that he was raising up Trump to trump the evil government of Obama,\u201d said Rice,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who lives in Maryland.\nThe impetus for Trumps trip was the war of words between the Ryan and Trump camps that occurred last week after the speaker declared that he was \u201cjust not ready\u201d to support Trump as the party nominee. Trump responded in a statement that he was not ready \u201cto support Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda.\u201d The comments highlighted the rifts that Trump will need to overcome in coming weeks as he seeks to unify the party.\nAt one point there was a question over whether Ryan would step down from his role as chairman of the Republican National Convention due to his differences with Trump. On Thursday, he indicated they had put that issue behind them.\n\u201cI am happy to serve in this capacity at the Republican convention,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI would honor the decision of our presumptive nominee and he did express that preference.\u201d\nTrump and Ryan sought to distance themselves from their hostile exchange ahead of their sit down Thursday. Trump said Wednesday night that the purpose of the meeting with Ryan is \u201cunity,\u201d striking a conciliatory tone after the public spat and adding that the two are looking to get to know each other.\nBut tensions within the party over Trump have only worsened in the week since he effectively clinched the nomination following the departures of rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, members of the Bush family and other top Republicans have declined to endorse Trump publicly. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Romney, who ran <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012 with</span> Ryan as his running mate, blasted Trump on Wednesday for suggesting he would not release his tax returns until after the election.\n</span>The real estate mogul will need party resources behind his White House run if he hopes to run a competitive bid against likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\nThe Trump campaign is finalizing plans with the RNC to set up a joint fundraising committee \u2014 a \u201cvictory fund\u201d \u2014 to solicit donations far larger in magnitude than what the campaign itself is legally allowed to accept. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The additional funds are routed to the party\u2019s war chest then used to finance national get-out-the-vote operations.\n</span>[Trump fundraising operation ramping up with Los Angeles kick-off]\nA chief worry among congressional Republicans is that Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric on immigration and his past disparaging comments about women will hurt GOP members in tight re-election battles this fall.\nSensing this blood in the water, congressional Democrats have eagerly attempted to portray Trump as the embodiment of what the Republican party has become.\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blasted Republicans, and McConnell in particular, during a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.\n\u201cAt some point in their conversation Donald Trump should thank the senior senator from Kentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and to the policies that he\u2019s led,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt was an obstructionist, anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-middle class, anti-environment and anti-Obama and anti-everything Republican Party of the last eight years that made Donald Trump a reality.\u201d\nBut this line of attack runs somewhat counter to the message from the campaign of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, which has sought to court center-right Republicans who remain uneasy about voting for Trump in the fall by pointing out how unpopular he is even within his own party.\n\u201cSince Donald Trump became the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee for president last Tuesday, the chorus of Republicans and conservative commentators from around the country rejecting his unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy has grown daily,\u201d the Clinton campaign blasted out in a statement as Trump met with Ryan.\nJenna Johnson, Karoun Demirjian, Paul Kane, Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan contributed to this story", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Other [articles that do not fit into any of the above categories but are relevant to the U.S. economy]": "5"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 8s "}}

inflation <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 40 years</span> by raising interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That would be the Fed\u2019s sixth interest rate increase this year and the fourth time in a row they\u2019ve bumped rates up by this much.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Fed officials have suggested that at some point it will be appropriate to dial back their increases to allow the full economic effect of these moves to play out.</span> The question is when that slowdown might happen.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Officials don\u2019t want investors to conclude that the Fed is easing up on its inflation fight, because market conditions could become more friendly to lending and economic growth as a result, the opposite of what central bankers are aiming for.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s a challenge that could be on full display when the Fed announces its rate decision <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2 p</span>.m. Eastern.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, holds his news conference at 2:30 p.m.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what else to know:\nStocks and U.S. government bonds were muted in early trading, as investors prepared to read the Fed\u2019s signals about its next steps.\n</span>Higher rates have a direct effect on Americans\u2019 lives. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Savers may earn more interest and borrowers can expect to pay more on mortgages, credit cards and other forms of debt.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Many top executives in Corporate America have said that they expect to see sustained demand for their goods and services, and that they expect to continue raising prices in the coming months.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That may make it harder for the Fed to stamp out inflation.\n</span>Mr. Powell is well liked across the political spectrum. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">But that could change as complaints about higher interest rates are likely to be lobbed at him personally.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s one spot of good news for the Fed:</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The global supply chain crunch of the last few years has gone a long way toward resolving itself.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Some products and materials continue to be in short supply, but shipping prices have fallen back to where they were before the pandemic, and a massive bottleneck of container ships waiting outside the Port of Los Angeles has dissipated.\n</span>Shipping is just one of the costs that businesses face, of course, but this should help translate into less pricing pressure on businesses that could ultimately benefit consumers in the months to come.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s also worth noting that A.P. Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said in its latest earnings report today that \u201cit is clear that freight rates have peaked and started to normalize during the quarter, driven by both decreasing demand and easing of supply chain congestion.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">As the Fed prepares to raise interest rates again, a backlash is growing among prominent Democrats in Congress, potentially setting the stage for a concerted pressure campaign from liberals to shift monetary policy ahead of <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2024 presidential</span> election.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The overarching concern: that the Fed\u2019s actions are risking throwing millions of Americans out of work by dramatically slowing the economy.\nSenators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have called on Mr. Powell to pause rate increases.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">This week, a coalition of progressives led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts warned Fed Chair Powell that \u201cwe are deeply concerned that your interest rate hikes risk slowing the economy to a crawl while failing to slow rising prices that continue to harm families.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">As the Federal Reserve battles the fastest inflation in four decades, the latest financial results from big companies may give them reasons to worry, The New York Times\u2019s Isabella Simonetti and Jeanna Smialek report.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many top executives have said that they expect to see sustained demand for their goods and services, and that they plan to continue to raise prices in the coming months.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">If companies continue to charge more and find that consumers are still willing to pay, it will make inflation harder to stamp out.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">That could mean more financial turmoil in the future.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Here are some themes from recent earnings reports:\nHigher prices are not denting consumer demand.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">McDonald\u2019s reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter and said it expected to raise <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">prices 10 percent</span> this year.</span> Hotels, airlines and related businesses have also benefited as consumers shift their spending away from goods and toward experiences.\nSome firms are raising profits simply because they can. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Chipotle Mexican Grill saw \u201cminimal resistance\u201d to price increases of more <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Incomes matter when it comes to inflation.</span> Many consumers have more savings than they did before the pandemic, but those who live paycheck to paycheck are buying less or turning to cheaper brands.\nThe tech giants point to an impending slowdown. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Alphabet reported a decline in earnings, Microsoft had its slowest growth in five years, and Intel announced a cost-cutting program and lowered its profit forecast for the year.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Everyone\u2019s wondering how higher interest rates are playing out in the economy, and we often look to the stock market for clues.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">But <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $24 trillion</span> U.S. government bond market is probably a better indicator of how interest rates are affecting the economy, and can provide predictions for the path for interest rates in the future.</span> Here\u2019s our explainer about how this works.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The Fed in September projected that it would raise rates by <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another 1.25 percentage</span> points this year, suggesting a three-quarter point move at this meeting and a half-point in December.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, could explain during his news conference today why that step-down might still be appropriate, economists think \u2014 but many expect that he will avoid explicitly committing to a smaller move next month.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to slow the pace of interest rate increases at some point soon because it wants to avoid overdoing its fight against inflation.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">While officials are determined to wrestle price increases lower, they are hoping to do that without absolutely tanking the economy \u2014 and they have already done a lot of tightening.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">They would like to see how that plays out as its full effects trickle through the economy.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The Fed last met on Sept.<span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21.</span></span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Since then, we\u2019ve had a solid jobs report, decent consumer demand numbers and a strong Employment Cost Index report that showed wages and benefits still climbing rapidly.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Job openings initially seemed like they were plunging, but a report released yesterday showed a bounce-back.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Altogether, the economy is looking remarkably resilient, making it harder to wrestle down rapid price increases.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">We saw a fresh acceleration in both the annual Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures indexes for September, after stripping out food and fuel costs.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">As the Federal Reserve has lifted its key interest rate several times this year, Americans have seen the effects on both sides of the household ledger:</span> Savers benefit from higher yields, but borrowers pay more.\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s how it works:\nCredit Cards\nCredit card rates are closely linked to the Fed\u2019s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise, usually within one or two billing cycles.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The average credit card rate <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 18.7 percent</span> as of Oct.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span> according to Bankrate.com, up from <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 16 percent</span> in March, when the Fed began its series of rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">\u201cWith the frequency of Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, it will be a drumbeat of higher rates for cardholders every couple of statement cycles,\u201d said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\nCar Loans\nCar loans are also expected to climb, but those increases continue to be overshadowed by the rising cost of buying a vehicle and the price you pay for filling it with gas.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Car loans tend to track the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed\u2019s key rate \u2014 but that\u2019s not the only factor that determines how much you\u2019ll pay.\n</span>A borrower\u2019s credit history, the type of vehicle, loan term and down payment are all baked into that rate calculation. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The average interest rate on new-car loans <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was

Most businesses aren\u2019t including expansion space when they sign new leases as they often did in the past, according to brokers. <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 212 million</span> square feet of sublease space is currently available, according to CoStar, a record high <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005 when</span> the company began tracking the metric.\nOffice landlords had hoped that leasing activity would start to return to prepandemic levels, but there is little sign of that happening, especially now with the threat of a recession looming. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">New tenant searches in October remained below half of their average prepandemic pace <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 and</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> according to the VTS Office Demand Index.\n</span>Not every developer is tapping the brakes.

The Durst Organization in New York famously built a 52-story tower in Times Square during the recession of the early 1990s without preleasing and signed Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications before it was completed.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But high interest rates and rising building costs in the current market have put a new wrinkle in this strategy.</span> Even if developers are able to attract tenants to their new buildings, they might not be able to get the rents they need for their investments to pay off, some analysts say.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistory shows there is likely to be good demand for new and high-quality office space,\u201d said Danny Ismail, a senior analyst at real estate analytics firm Green Street.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut will demand be there at the rents needed to justify those developments?\u201d\nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com\nContinue reading your article with\na WSJ membership\nAlready a member?</span> Sign In", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 31s "}}

owners\u2019 equivalent rent component of price indexes should be monitored carefully, as rising home prices could lead to upward pressure on rents,\u201d minutes from the Fed\u2019s September meeting, released Wednesday, said.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Rent is less critical to the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the one it officially targets when it shoots <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> annual inflation on average, than it is to the C.P.I.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But it is a big part of people\u2019s experience with prices, so it could help shape their expectations about future cost increases.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Those expectations matter a lot to the Fed.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">If consumers come to anticipate faster inflation, they may begin to demand higher wages to cover their rising expenses.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">As businesses lift prices to cover rising costs, they could set off an upward spiral.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Already, some key measures of inflation outlooks \u2014 notably the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations \u2014 have jumped higher.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The Fed is already preparing to start slowing the large bond purchases it has been making during the pandemic to keep longer-term interest rates low and money flowing around the economy.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">If inflation stays high, the Fed may also come under pressure to raise its policy interest rate, its more traditional and more powerful tool.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">That might slow mortgage lending, cool the housing market and weigh down inflation.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">But doing that would come at a big cost, slowing the labor market when there <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 5 million</span> fewer jobs than before the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">So for now, Fed officials are getting themselves into a position where they can be nimble without signaling that they\u2019re poised to raise rates.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">White House officials are also wrestling with their options for easing housing price pressures.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">President Biden\u2019s economic agenda includes measures that would build more houses and discourage zoning rules that keep new construction at bay.\n</span>Such an intervention would take time \u2014 homes are not built overnight. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">And in the meantime, rents will almost certainly continue moving in the inflation data, which reflect rising housing costs at a long delay.</span> More up-to-date measures of rental pricing pressure produced by Apartment List and Zillow have shown costs climbing in recent months, though many measures of rent and new leases have calmed down somewhat after a red-hot summer.\nThe national median rent has <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 16.4 percent</span> since January, Apartment List said in its September rental report, with monthly growth slowing slightly from its July peak.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">U.S. Inflation & Supply Chain Problems\nCovid\u2019s impact on supply continues.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Price increases that grew out of pandemic-related shutdowns and supply chain disruptions have continued.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Here are some of its effects:\n\u201cThis is still very strong by historical standards \u2014 we\u2019re in off season,\u201d said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s a racecar slowing down ahead of a turn, but it\u2019s still going faster than we ever have in our lives.\u201d\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Whether rent growth speeds up or slows next year may hinge on whether the government support that has given households the financial ability to afford housing gives way to a strong job market.\n</span>\u201cThere\u2019s room to run, for sure,\u201d based on demographics alone, Mr. Ozimek said. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe question is whether the economy is going to go into full employment, or whether there\u2019s a slowdown.\u201d\nRents could heat up as big cities including New York and Los Angeles rebound from the pandemic, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of Redfin.</span> While smaller cities\u2019 rental markets have been hot for months, the median rent in Manhattan climbed for the first time since the start of the pandemic in September, data from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman showed.\n<span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The recovery in the New York area as a whole has been uneven as some families have moved to the city, bidding up prices, while others are struggling to pay, said Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents landlords of mostly rent-stabilized housing.\n</span>\u201cYou have bidding wars for one unit, and then a renter who can\u2019t pay,\u201d he said. <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cA tale of two cities is happening within the same building.\u201d\nDrew Hamrick, the senior vice president of the Colorado Apartment Association, a landlord group, said the rise in rents is not driven by landlords but by market factors.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cLandlords don\u2019t really set the price, consumers set the price,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s musical chairs.\u201d\n<span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Even if there is a pullback in rents next year, today\u2019s suddenly higher housing costs could make for a painful adjustment period.</span> Higher rent costs can reverberate through people\u2019s lives and force tough decisions.\nLuke Martinez, a 27-year-old in Greenville, a town in East Texas, is contemplating buying a trailer and setting his family up on an R.V. lot after learning that he is losing the three-bedroom house he has been renting for <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1,000 per</span> month <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016.</span>\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane the amount of rent, even in this little podunk town,\u201d Mr. Martinez said.\nHe\u2019s looking at paying up <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,500 per</span> month for a new place, which will be tough. After getting laid off at the start of the pandemic, he had been living partly on savings \u2014 padded by an insurance payout after his car was stolen and totaled. He returned to working in automotive repair only this week. His wife had been working the front desk at a hotel until two months ago, but she is now home-schooling their 8-year-old.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">If they end up renting at the higher price, they will most likely afford it by forgoing a new car.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much just scraping by,\u201d he said of his lifestyle.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 39s "}}

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will host a livestreamed town hall summit on climate change next month, a move that may intensify pressure on the next Congress to curb planet-warming emissions and challenge TV networks to cover a rapidly worsening crisis they\u2019ve long ignored.\n\nThe 90-minute event \u2015 scheduled <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7 p</span>.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Dec.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 </span>\u2015 will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center Auditorium in Washington and broadcast over Facebook, YouTube and Twitter by seven progressive media outlets.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost by phone.</span> \u201cThe good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back.\u201d\n\nSpeakers <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">include 350.org</span> founder Bill McKibben, activist and \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d star Shailene Woodley, climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel, activist and musician Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, and Mayor Dale Ross of deep-red Georgetown, Texas, whose avowedly pragmatic embrace of newly cheap renewable energy has made him a poster boy for how Republicans could quit climate change denialism.\n\nIt\u2019s the fifth live-broadcast town hall Sanders has hosted. Past programs examined the universal health care proposal Medicare for All, inequality, the Iran nuclear deal, and workers vs. chief executives.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The event bolsters Sanders, a likely contender for <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 Democratic</span> presidential nomination, as the most serious candidate on climate change, offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions.\n\n</span>The summit, which took months to plan, will take place less than a month after Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) propelled talk of a so-called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream, giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October, the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">next 12 years</span> or risk catastrophic warming <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with $54 trillion</span> in damage.\n\nThe historic wildfire that <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 63 dead</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 631 missing</span> in Northern California this month, in what was once the Golden State\u2019s rainy season, offers a glimpse of that future, Sanders warned.\n\nSearch and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned by the Camp Fire in Northern California.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is a growing consciousness,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long, hard struggle to transform our energy system.\u201d\n\nClimate remains a low priority for most voters. <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Just 38 percent</span> of registered voters said candidates\u2019 positions on global warming would be \u201cvery important\u201d to their voting decisions, according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 28 issues</span> voters ranked in the questionnaire.\n\nBut among liberal Democrats in that poll, the issue ranked fourth, behind health care, gun policies and general environmental protections. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">A YouGov survey <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2018 voters</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">found 75 percent</span> of Democrats strongly supported charging companies with big carbon dioxide footprints a polluter fee, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 56 percent</span> favored giving unemployed Americans federally backed jobs in energy efficiency and weatherization.\n\n</span>In the lead up to <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 midterm</span></span> elections, the fossil fuel industry <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent $100 million</span> to crush pro-climate ballot measures across the West, and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so-called eco-socialists. And a new majority of Democratic state attorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages.\n\nActivists, freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of California\u2019s deadliest wildfire, seem primed for action, and the party\u2019s progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue that\u2019s remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [climate change] is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable, because that was not the case even five years ago,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist and Yale\u2019s climate program director. \u201cIf you think of Bernie, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be talking about inequality or civil rights. There\u2019s a whole host of progressive issues, yet this is the one he\u2019s leading with. It may suggest there\u2019s been an alignment of the stars.\u201d\n\nLast week, youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit-ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nAt least three sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus agreed to back a resolution Ocasio-Cortez proposed to establish a 15-member Green New Deal panel. Activists are hoping Sanders\u2019 event will add <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 presidential</span> contender\u2019s star power to their movement.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system.\u201d\n\n- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\n\u201cHe helped popularize things like Medicare for All, a living wage and a lot of other fights he\u2019s taken up,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of Sunrise Movement.</span> \u201cI hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire that\u2019s been lit under politicians and the public over the past week.\u201d\n\nSanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2017,</span> he co-sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100-percent clean energy <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2050.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The bill <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">included $7 billion</span> in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil-fuel communities, and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs.</span> In <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017,</span> Sanders introduced a bill to <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spend $146 billion</span> rebuilding storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is extremely bold legislation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf there are Democrats who cannot support it, well, we\u2019ve got to push pressure on them.\u201d\n\nThe relative absence of climate science from TV broadcasts that dominate American political discourse makes it hard to raise awareness of the near-term threats warming poses.\n\nSeventy-one percent of major, televised debates in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 midterm</span></span> elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 107 segments</span> ABC, CBS and NBC aired from Nov.<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 to</span> Nov.<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13 on</span> the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News aired a <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 260 minutes</span> of climate coverage,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 79 percent</span> of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trump\u2019s personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of huge consequence and you would think that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox would be talking about this every day, having the debate, \u2018What do we do? Where do we go?\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cClearly you aren\u2019t seeing that debate.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 inequality town hall in March <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drew 1.7 million</span> viewers. Similar numbers might show cable news producers that climate change is not, as MSNBC host Chris Hayes revealingly described it in July, a \u201cratings killer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are a big deal,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe hope this can be part of the revolution that we need in thinking on climate change.\u201d", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Government revenue and expenses [articles focused on lawmaking and government action including treaties, regulation, taxes, laws, and spending]": "3"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 0s "}}

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\nIt\u2019s always been easy to prophesy Hong Kong\u2019s doom. Ever since Britain handed over the bustling colonial entrep\u00f4t to Beijing <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1997,</span> prognosticators and politicos of all stripes warned of its inexorable decline. Hong Kong\u2019s liberal and quasi-democratic traditions, including civil liberties such as freedom of speech, would wane and wither under the new Communist overlords, they said. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">So, too, would the economic preeminence of this famous port at the heart of global trade, eclipsed by booming cities on the Chinese mainland.</span> And, ultimately, Hong Kong\u2019s supposedly apathetic local populace would accept its fate and get with the program.\nNone of these fears are misguided and, in some cases, have proved far too real. But for all the political pressure bearing down on Hong Kong, the city still has a way of defying the naysayers and standing up \u2014 even if that means rising against the tide of history itself.\nThat spirit has been on display this week. On Sunday, Hong Kong saw its biggest protests in half a decade, with possibly upward of a million people flooding the streets in opposition to a draft bill that would allow for extraditions to the mainland. A pocket of protesters who attempted to hold a sit-in at Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council clashed with riot police and were blanketed with pepper spray.\nThe legislation\u2019s proponents insist that current legal loopholes \u2014 Hong Kong does not have extradition treaties with China or Taiwan \u2014 need to be closed. But its critics argue that the bill fundamentally threatens the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model that has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a degree of political autonomy <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1997.</span> Permitting extraditions to the mainland, they contend, would enable China\u2019s authoritarian leadership to further erode the rule of law and civil liberties in Hong Kong. When a senior Communist Party official in the ruling Politburo publicly offered his support for the measure, it only deepened suspicions in Hong Kong.\n\u201cThis is the last fight for Hong Kong,\u201d Martin Lee, a pioneering democracy activist, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe proposal is the most dangerous threat to our freedoms and way of life since the handover.\u201d\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing chief executive, Carrie Lam, did not heed the protests and is pressing ahead with the bill\u2019s passage. By Tuesday night, groups of protesters were encamped near the Legislative Council, where elected lawmakers as well as officials handpicked by Beijing were set to debate the bill on Wednesday. The legislative body is widely viewed to be rigged in Beijing\u2019s favor. And so there\u2019s now talk of mass action, strikes, university boycotts and other forms of civil disobedience to force the region\u2019s leadership to reconsider its current course of action.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cLabor unions and small businesses across Asia\u2019s financial capital planned more strikes,\u201d reported Timothy McLaughlin for The Washington Post.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn a sign of the rising stakes, more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 4,000 aviation</span> employees from various carriers, including the flagship Cathay Pacific Airways, signed a petition requesting to join the strikes.\u201d\n</span>On Wednesday, thousands of protesters flooded the streets of central Hong Kong near the Legislative Council building. Bowing to public pressure, Hong Kong\u2019s lawmakers decided to postpone the debate of the bill.\nHanging over the current tensions is the legacy of the Umbrella Movement, the mass pro-democracy protest <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 that</span> occupied Hong Kong\u2019s main commercial district <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 79 days</span>. Despite galvanizing a new generation of young activists, it achieved little in the way of political change. Instead, both China and the local government have clamped down on dissidents and the right to dissent in Hong Kong.\n\u201cFor the past five years, residents of Hong Kong have fought with much difficulty against the erosion of our freedom,\u201d activist Denise Ho wrote last week in a column for The Washington Post. \u201cPro-democracy lawmakers have been unjustly disqualified from office, booksellers have been kidnapped, and activists have been sentenced heavily for protesting. It\u2019s obvious that our city\u2019s system is no longer working in the people\u2019s favor.\u201d\nIn Chinese President Xi Jinping, Hong Kong faces an unmoved, unrelenting overlord. Experts suggest Xi, who has cemented his reputation as one of China\u2019s most ruthless leaders, has little incentive to heed the protests of the Hong Kongers, let alone the complaints of Western governments on their behalf. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">(In Washington, activists and lawmakers are calling on President Trump to retaliate economically if the measure gets passed.)\n</span>\u201c[Xi] will do whatever he can to enforce Beijing\u2019s sovereignty and thumb his nose at Western efforts to interfere with Hong Kong or Taiwan,\u201d Willy Lam, a Hong Kong-based political scientist, said to the Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cHe is a tough opponent of the Western order.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It doesn\u2019t help Hong Kong\u2019s cause that its economic clout has somewhat dipped in the decades since the handover, with business interests and executive talent drifting either toward greater opportunity within China or further away from the increasingly long hand of Beijing.</span> Out of fear for the future, large numbers of families are choosing to leave the city. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Earlier this year, the GDP of the Chinese megacity of Shenzhen \u2014 once a tiny fishing village in Hong Kong\u2019s backwaters \u2014 surpassed that of the former British colony for the first time.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Though still Asia\u2019s financial capital, Hong Kong looks tinier and tinier when set against China\u2019s ever-rising colossus.\n</span>But those among its more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 7 million</span> residents who believe in Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms aren\u2019t going down without a fight. The current standoff has revived the city\u2019s civil society and pro-democracy movement. \u201cYoung people who had checked out from disappointment and frustration are reappearing, and once again actively participating,\u201d Ho wrote.\n\u201cJudging by the crowds on Sunday, Hong Kongers\u2019 scorn for the government on the mainland may have reached new heights,\u201d wrote Yi-Zheng Lian, a Japan-based commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs. \u201cThis cannot be what Beijing wanted.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Sunny Leung,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> was distributing red fliers denouncing the extraditions bill. \u201cMaybe we [Hong Kong] will die, but we will not die in silence,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cWe are protesting until the end.\u201d\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

But coronavirus now threatens to put a damper on campaign season.\nIt's on \u2014 for now: President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all said that they will continue to hold campaign rallies despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassing 500\u2014 and the cancellation of other large-scale events and gatherings across the country amid concerns about its spread.\n- But Sanders suggested the situation is fluid: \u201cWe will not endanger the health of anybody in this country,\u201d Sanders said on CNN's \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201c \u2026 We are watching this thing very, very carefully. What is most important is the health of the American people.\u201d\n- Sanders said that \u201cin the best of all possible worlds\u201d the three candidates might want to scale back travel and their exposure to large crowds. \u201cBut right now, we're running as hard as we can.\u201d\n- Biden told reporters in Jackson, Miss., on Sunday \u2014 while rubbing Purell sanitizer on his hands \u2014 that his campaign is \u201clistening to the experts at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and doing everything they recommend.\u201d\n- The AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of unions, was the latest organization to cancel its presidential forum scheduled for this week in Orlando, Florida. Biden and Sanders were both slated to attend.\nThe comments show the dueling pressures on the trail: Sanders and Biden promise to run aggressive campaigns as they consolidate support in what's now a two-man race for the Democratic nomination \u2014 but don't want to downplay the recommendations of public health officials warning millions of Americans that large crowds could increase their risk of getting infected.\nAnd while Trump, for his part, has brushed off concerns about coronavirus and insisted as recently as Saturday that \u201cwe'll have tremendous rallies,\u201d our colleagues our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and Juliet Eilperin report that \u201cchanges to Trump\u2019s travel schedule are also being contemplated, after public health officials warned that elderly Americans should reconsider flying on airplanes and avoid large crowds.\u201d\n- \u201cTrump,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 73,</span> had no campaign rallies scheduled as of Sunday evening, marking the first time this year that there were no such events on the books,\u201d they note.\n- The next round of delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday when six states will vote: Idaho, Mississippi, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.\nBut public health officials have escalated warnings: \u201cIf you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,\u201d the nation's top expert on infectious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on NBC News's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cSo it's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable. When I say 'protect,' I mean right now. Not wait until things get worse. Say no large crowds, no long trips. And above all, don't get on a cruise ship.\u201d\n- Worth noting: Trump, like his fellow septuagenarian candidates Sanders and Biden, are \u201cat higher risk for serious illness from covid-19,\u201d according to guidance from the Centers For Disease Control (CDC).\n- It's up to individuals to decide what's best for them: \u201cThis will be a recommendation,\u201d Fauci added.\n- But their decisions now are critical: \u201cWe have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic,\u201d former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on CBS News's \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWhat you want to do is \u2026 put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted.\u201d\nPotential close calls at political events: The confirmed coronavirus cases at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Conservative Political Action Conference, both large gatherings of prominent politicians, activists and voters, have raised concerns about the virus's spread.\nThere's growing concern in the White House about Trump's own exposure: \u201cTrump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during [CPAC] last month,\u201d Toluse, Josh and Juliet report. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus that he has sought to minimize as it has rocked financial markets and tested his leadership skills.\u201d\n- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) decided to quarantine himself after being informed that he interacted with the CPAC attendee diagnosed with the virus: \u201cI'm not experiencing any symptoms and I feel fine and healthy,\u201d he wrote in a statement.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cNevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, Until <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 14 days</span> have passed since the CPAC interaction.\u201d\n</span>- Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) also announced that he is under self-quarantine after being in contact with the individual for \u201can extended period of time.\u201d \u201cI am closing my office in Washington, D.C. for the week and my team will follow the previously approved Tele-commute plan,\u201d he said.\n- There's broader \u201canxiety in an aging Congress,\u201d NBC's Kasie Hunt and Alex Moe report: \u201cMembers of Congress are becoming increasingly anxious about coronavirus, and there is growing pressure on leadership to take steps to protect lawmakers \u2014 even potentially recessing for a period of weeks \u2014 two Democratic congressional sources said Sunday.\u201d\nTHE WEEK AHEAD IN TRAVEL: But Trump's travel continues for now. The Republican Jewish Coalition is holding its annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas later this week where the president is currently a featured speaker. There are so far four confirmed cases of coronavirus in Nevada.\n- \u201cWe will announce rallies when we are ready to do so,\u201d Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, told our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Juliet Eilperin and Paige Winfield Cunningham. \u201cAnd we have loads of campaign events on the event schedule on the website,\u201d she added.\n- Sanders has an event scheduled today in Detroit with health officials to discuss the coronavirus.\n- Biden will also host an event in Detroit with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who just endorsed the former veep.\nPAST THE POINT OF CONTAINMENT: It might be only a matter of time before the federal response shifts and candidates are forced to cancel. U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams, part of the administration's task force on coronavirus, said on CBS News's \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the administration was past the point of \u201ccontainment\u201d and now \u201ctrying to help people understand how to mitigate the impact of disease spread.\u201d\n- \u201cWell, containment worked to slow the introduction of the virus and gave people time to prepare, and now we know that communities need to look at how we deal with \u2014 with community spread and things such as social distancing, not having large gatherings, pulling down events,\u201d Adams told Margaret Brennan. \u201cThose are conversations that communities need to be having right now.\u201d\n- What is social distancing?: \u201cI'm not asking everyone to stay at home and lock the door for a month,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen. \u201cI'm saying, be thoughtful every time you contemplate getting together with a crowd or group.\u201d\nBut Gottlieb suggested that more aggressive measures to mitigate the outbreak that Trump has been reticent to implement might be necessary. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He said policymakers should give state and local governments economic support so they can take more aggressive steps to limit people's exposure.\n- \u201cI think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy.</span> But that\u2019s what\u2019s going to need to happen,\u201d Gottlieb told Brennan of the idea of governors imposing mandatory quarantines in affected areas. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s going to need to happen. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">States and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic.\u201d\n-</span> And he urged the Trump administration to provide a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d: \u201cThere is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step, make that leap, if you will.\"\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At The White House\nWHITE HOUSE AND FED FIGHT OVER RESPONSE:</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Federal Reserve and the White House appear to disagree about the severity of the potential hit the coronavirus will inflict on the U.S. economy \u2013 and what to do in response, our colleagues Heather Long and Jeff Stein report.\n</span>- <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The Fed's view: Chair Jerome H. Powell and Fed officials have suggested that the central bank only has a limited role to play \u2014 though some other Fed officials have suggested a broader economic stimulus pushed by Congress or the White House would have a greater effect than power of interest rate cuts, our colleagues write.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The West Wing itself is divided about how to respond: \u201c[Trump] has raised the idea of a payroll tax cut to put more money in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d our colleagues report.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But Larry Kudlow, one of the president's top economic advisers, has rejected such a cut and prefers more targeted relief for specific industry.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">- Other ideas include things long on conservatives' wish lists, such as tax reductions on investment income.</span> There is also talk of possible tariff relief with China.\n- <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">A key graf: \u201cUnlike the seasoned economists and Wall Street players who dealt with <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 financial</span> panic such as Lawrence H.

Timothy Cole, rector of Christ Church Georgetown, our colleagues Fenit Nirappil, Rebecca Tan, Erin Cox and Jenna Portnoy report. \u201cAuthorities in Maryland and Virginia announced three new cases but said the risks for public exposure were low,\u201d they report.\nWhat governments are doing abroad: Italy and Saudi Arabia enacted new travel restrictions and Iran, the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East, suspended flights to Europe, our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Juliet Eilperin and Kim Bellware report\n- The situation in Italy has caused mass confusion: \u201cThe plan to lock down large swaths of the north was the first major attempt by a democracy during the coronavirus crisis to radically halt the routines of daily life \u2014 an effort that will have significant impacts on civil liberties,\u201d our colleagues Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli report from Rome. \u201cBut in the hours before and after the measure became law,\u201d people continued to travel to and from the northern hubs of Milan and Venice.\nWorth a read: Our colleagues Ashley Parker, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Lena H. Sun detail a \"portrait of the precious weeks that [Trump] and his administration frittered away in trying to deal with the coronavirus\u201d in a weekend piece outlining coronavirus testing, agency infighting and an apparently uninterested president.\n- Health experts say the White House did not use its time wisely: The administration should have requested emergency funding one month earlier, our colleagues report.\n- Had such funding come earlier, government agencies could have begun developing vaccines; the federal government could have made sure state and local health departments had the resources they needed and hospitals could have stockpiled supplies.\n- Trump defended his administration's response: \u201cWe have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">V.P. is doing a great job.</span> The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!\"\nGlobal Power\nMEXICO'S DAY WITHOUT WOMEN: \u201cWomen poured into the streets on Sunday to start a two-day protest and national strike against gender-based violence, in what organizers hope will be a turning point for women's rights in a country disfigured by violence and machismo,\u201d our colleague Mary Beth Sheridan reports from Mexico City.\n- \u201cThe annual demonstration for women\u2019s rights here has turned into something of a social uprising after a string of gruesome killings,\u201d our colleague writes. \u201cWomen took to the streets around the country \u2014 from U.S. border cities such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to communities in southern Guerrero state, where indigenous women and peasants joined marches.\u201d\n- This has become a major political challenge: President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has been one of Latin America's most popular leaders, but \u201chis approval ratings have slipped as he has responded in what many view as a ham-handed way to the wave of outrage over femicides.\u201d\nProtests marking international women's day took place around the world: \u201cFrom the streets of Manila to the plazas of Santiago, Chile,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201cTensions marred some celebrations, with police reportedly using tear gas to break up a demonstration by thousands of women in Turkey and security forces arresting demonstrators at a rally in Kyrgyzstan.\u201d\nViral\nJust in: Twitter applied its new manipulated media label for the first time to a deceptively edited video of Joe Biden.
