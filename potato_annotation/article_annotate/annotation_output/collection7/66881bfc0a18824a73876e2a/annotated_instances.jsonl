{"id": "24060", "displayed_text": "<h3>Top Office Developers Hit the Pause Button on New Projects</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. real-estate developers are delaying major office projects already under way or in the planning stages, discouraged by high vacancy rates and the reduction in workspace demand resulting from remote work.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Some property developers view periods of economic uncertainty and weak office demand as good times to launch new projects.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Because large-scale developments tend to take three to five years or longer, developers bet that tenants looking to trade up in office quality will be drawn to modern offices with lots of amenities, just as the economy is gaining steam.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But soaring interest rates and the slow pace at which workers are returning to offices have even some risk-taking developers wary about the future.</span> With office use only about half of what it was before the pandemic, some of the most active developers are postponing major projects and are losing their appetite for new developments.\n\u2018There\u2019s increasing uncertainty in the world, and tenants are acting accordingly.\u2019\u2014 Vornado President Michael Franco\nThat list includes real estate heavyweights Vornado Realty Trust, Houston-based Hines, Kilroy Realty Corp. and Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc., according to the companies or people familiar with the matter.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cCaution is the word of the day,\u201d Vornado\u2019s president and chief financial officer, Michael Franco, said on Vornado\u2019s earnings call last week.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s increasing uncertainty in the world, and tenants are acting accordingly.\u201d\nSome analysts took these and other comments by Chief Executive Steven Roth as a sign that Vornado might move slower than expected on its planned new office tower on the site of Manhattan\u2019s Hotel Pennsylvania, which it is demolishing. Mr. Roth declined to address that matter on the call.\nKilroy, which earlier this year delayed <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 600,000</span>-square-foot development in San Diego, said last month that it was shelving <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 500,000</span>-square-foot project in Austin, Texas, that had already started.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere are times to buy, times to sell, times to develop and times such as now to be patient,\u201d John Kilroy, chief executive and chairman of Kilroy Realty, said on an earnings call.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 156 million</span> square feet of office space construction currently is under way in the <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">largest 54 U</span>.S. markets, down <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 186 million</span> in the first quarter <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020 before</span> the pandemic hit, according to</span> data firm CoStar Group Inc. That figure is expected to decline further as developers confront rising vacancies and falling rents in most markets.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat\u2019s next for developers of commercial office space? Join the conversation below.\nThe national office vacancy rate stands <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 12.5%,</span> up <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 9.6% in</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 and</span> the highest <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2011,</span> CoStar said. Just as worrisome for developers:<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 37% of</span> the space under development remains available, more than double the rate in<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 and</span> approaching the <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 39% in</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2008,</span> CoStar said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not quite <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2008 levels</span>, but we certainly could get there in the next year,\u201d said Nancy Muscatello, a CoStar senior analyst.\nMany companies have told workers to return to their offices after more than two years of remote work. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But businesses also are adopting new workplace strategies that allow employees to work from home a few days during the week.\n</span>As a result, tenants need less office space. Most businesses aren\u2019t including expansion space when they sign new leases as they often did in the past, according to brokers. <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 212 million</span> square feet of sublease space is currently available, according to CoStar, a record high <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005 when</span> the company began tracking the metric.\nOffice landlords had hoped that leasing activity would start to return to prepandemic levels, but there is little sign of that happening, especially now with the threat of a recession looming. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">New tenant searches in October remained below half of their average prepandemic pace <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 and</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> according to the VTS Office Demand Index.\n</span>Not every developer is tapping the brakes. Boston Properties Inc., the office real-estate investment trust, is building <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 390,000</span>-square-foot project in San Jose, Calif., near a planned new Google campus. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe would expect an improvement in market conditions\u201d by the time it is completed in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2024,</span> a spokeswoman said.\n</span>Newsletter Sign-up\nReal Estate\nFrom aspirational residences to major commercial deals.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Developers forging ahead say that demand remains strong for the highest-quality space with great locations and amenities such as restaurants, good views, fitness centers and daycare.</span> Businesses adopting new workplace strategies feel it is worth paying higher rents for this space partly because they are leasing less and partly to encourage workers to return to the office for more days.\n\u201cThey want to find the best space with amenities, with restaurants, with locations to bring their people back,\u201d said Steve Center, senior vice president of American Assets Trust Inc., which is developing <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 200,000</span>-square-foot office building in San Diego without any preleasing.\nThis strategy has worked for some developers in past downturns. The Durst Organization in New York famously built a 52-story tower in Times Square during the recession of the early 1990s without preleasing and signed Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications before it was completed.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But high interest rates and rising building costs in the current market have put a new wrinkle in this strategy.</span> Even if developers are able to attract tenants to their new buildings, they might not be able to get the rents they need for their investments to pay off, some analysts say.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistory shows there is likely to be good demand for new and high-quality office space,\u201d said Danny Ismail, a senior analyst at real estate analytics firm Green Street.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut will demand be there at the rents needed to justify those developments?\u201d\nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com\nContinue reading your article with\na WSJ membership\nAlready a member?</span> Sign In", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific [articles focused on a single business]": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Same": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
{"id": "77716", "displayed_text": "<h3>Lionel Richie Has Some Bedding to Sell You</h3>Lionel Richie Has Some Bedding to Sell You\n\u201cI\u2019m in the bedroom,\u201d Mr. Richie said, referring to his many romantic songs. \u201cAt least use my sheets.\u201d\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Supported by\nOn a recent, sticky August afternoon, Lionel Richie stepped onto the second-floor landing of the rotunda in J.C. Penney\u2019s corporate headquarters in Plano, Tex., and surveyed its employees gathered above and below him.</span> Microphone in hand, he bellowed: \u201cMy people!\u201d\nMr. Richie is a four-time Grammy winner, with <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 100 million</span> records sold, so he counts a lot of people as \u201chis\u201d people. Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers danced with him during his \u201cBrick House\u201d days with the Commodores, then swayed to his \u201cEndless Love\u201d serenades when he went solo. Younger fans may know him as a judge on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d or as father to Nicole, Miles and Sofia.\nNow, he has the undivided attention of a new fan: J.C. Penney, the struggling department store where Mr. Richie is introducing his new home goods collection.\nThat\u2019s right. Lionel Richie, the 69-year-old multiplatinum singer-songwriter, is debuting a line of sheets and towels, which will be available in stores beginning Sept.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7.</span> With his entourage and a camera crew in tow, he made a three-hour stop at the J.C. Penney campus, where he tried to excite the sellers of his black satin comforters and gold-embroidered pillowcases by, among other things, handing out two bouquets of roses and crashing a meeting of the board of directors.\nThe grand finale was the gathering in the rotunda. As the initial applause and cheers died down, Mr. Richie leaned on the wooden railing and shook his head, almost laughing.\n\u201cThis is absolutely insanity,\u201d he said.\nWhich is what you may be thinking, too. An explanation is forthcoming, but first the puns: Hello, is it zzzs you\u2019re looking for? After a night of Dancing on the Ceiling, you can climb under this comforter and sleep All Night Long. Mr. Richie, once a Penny Lover is now a Penneys lover \u2014 and he\u2019s coming for your linen closet.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the bedroom,\u201d Mr. Richie said, referring to his many romantic songs. \u201cAt least use my sheets.\u201d\nCelebrities sell stuff because it works.\nTo understand how we got to a place where we could collectively climb into bed with Lionel Richie, consider the threadbare, well-worn path of celebrity merchandising. Many stars have product lines; some simply license their names, while others are intimately involved in design.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Stores often demand the right to exclusively sell these product lines in order to ensure a lock on each celebrity\u2019s fan base.\n</span>Pop stars tend to gravitate toward creating their own clothing and accessories lines, where a few oft-cited individuals have had considerable success (see: Jessica Simpson and Victoria Beckham).\nHome goods make sense for the Rachael Rays and Martha Stewarts of the world, but it is something of a new frontier for musicians, and a strategic one. The category attracts a broader customer base, with looser ties to age or a gender, and presents much less fashion risk. A set of sheets can sit on a store shelf for months. A strong-selling towel can stick around for years.\nFacing declines in traffic, department stores like J.C. Penney are betting on star power to attract shoppers. Before hitting the sheets with Mr. Richie, J.C. Penney carried bedding collections from the actress Eva Longoria and the model Cindy Crawford. It also plans to sell bedding by Ayesha Curry, a foodie and the wife of the N.B.A. player Stephen Curry, this fall.\nThe store is especially excited about Mr. Richie\u2019s line, which will be manufactured by Sobel Westex, the Las Vegas-based textile manufacturer behind Sleep Like a King, the bedding collection by Larry King and his wife, Shawn.\nExecutives see a strong correlation between the core J.C. Penney shopper \u2014 a woman over the age <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 45 </span>\u2014 and Mr. Richie. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">His E-Score, a ranking of a celebrity\u2019s marketability from E-Poll Market Research, is a near-<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">perfect 98 out</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100.</span></span> Nine out <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 people</span> over the age <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 55 recognized</span> his name, <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97 percent</span> said they liked him.\nAmong the top attributes women assigned to him were \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cgood energy.\u201d It\u2019s not far off from Mr. Richie\u2019s own sense of his brand, which he says is love. To guys, he is a musical wingman; to ladies, a swoony crooner.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">J.C. Penney could use some good energy after its most recent earnings report, which sent its stock plunging.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Katheryn Burchett, the chain\u2019s senior vice president of merchandising for home, said Mr. Richie\u2019s collection fills an aesthetic void in its assortment, pointing to the already strong online sales for the black-and-gold satin-like three-piece comforter set, on sale <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $149.99.</span>\n</span>\u201cWe really want to reach out to his fans that may not have been in a J.C. Penney store for a while and get them to come in,\u201d Ms. Burchett said.\nLionel Richie loves home goods. Don\u2019t act so surprised.\nIf you\u2019re still thinking, \u201cHome goods? Really?\u201d that\u2019s O.K. Mr. Richie\u2019s friends have said the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m actually enjoying this,\u201d he said.\nFrom an ornate sitting room in his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., Mr. Richie explained it further. \u201cI was desperately trying to get the next hit record,\u201d he said, when he reached a point of wanting something new, an additional outlet for his creative energy.\nHe had his team reach out to Walter Pelaez, the chief executive of Sobel, and they had dinner together at Mr. Richie\u2019s house on Valentine\u2019s Day <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span> There, \u201cthe magic started,\u201d Mr. Pelaez recalled. They spent all night long \u2014 just kidding, it was more like several hours \u2014 talking through the possibilities.\nCelebrities are infusing the otherwise stale design landscape with a much-needed newness, Mr. Pelaez said, so he came to Mr. Richie\u2019s house already intent on sealing the deal. For a musician to be thought of, his or her song has to be playing on the radio \u2014 a fleeting moment.\nBut sheets and towels are a permanent reminder, a particularly intimate connection. \u201cIt\u2019s in your bedroom, it\u2019s in your bathroom, it\u2019s touching your body,\u201d Mr. Pelaez said.\nMr. Richie said that interior design has been a hobby of his since he bought his home two decades ago. He performs <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 70 live</span> shows around the world each year and takes respite from the road by decorating his own space.\nHe collects sizable souvenirs from his travels, like the piece of the Berlin Wall in his backyard. Now, those same adventures inform his product design.\nThe J.C. Penney bed and bath line is the beginning of what Mr. Richie sees as a much bigger lifestyle brand, Lionel Richie Home, with more categories to come. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s his second attempt in home goods; <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 he</span> hosted a dinner party to introduce a higher-priced offering of glassware and china.\n</span>That collection had limited distribution, according to a spokesman. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The concept will be reimagined at more affordable prices in the future.\n</span>\u201cI happen to stand every night in front of my customer. It\u2019s called my fans,\u201d Mr. Richie said. He appeals to people looking for quality and value. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Their questions are practical: \u201cHow much is it going to cost?\u201d and \u201cIs it going to last after the third washing?\u201d\nHis current line will be merchandised alongside color-coordinated pieces from J.C. Penney\u2019s own label.</span> If a shopper buys a Lionel Richie Home six-piece white-and-black towel set, on sale <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $39.99,</span> she could pick up a few solid black towels from J.C. Penney\u2019s line to coordinate. The intermingling of brands was intentional: It ensures both parties are invested in the success of the other.\nThe in-store setup that will be featured <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 250 locations</span> includes three photos of Mr. Richie: a head shot over each of the display beds and \u2014 the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2014 a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Richie standing between the two. The hope is that shoppers will see it as a selfie moment.\nMr. Richie certainly did. During his visit to J.C. Penney headquarters, he jumped on stage unprompted to pose for pictures with his cardboard self. Later, in the rotunda, Mr. Richie declared that he would change the way people think about selling. \u201cThe only way to do that is you have to do something slightly ridiculous,\u201d he said.\nIt always helps to have a sense of humor.\nIndeed, rather than run from the jokes, Mr. Richie joins them. The merchandise booth in Las Vegas, where Mr. Richie has a residency at Planet Hollywood until October, for example, sells mugs that read, \u201cHello, is it tea you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\nIt\u2019s funny, and serves a purpose. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">At the J.C. Penney headquarters, when an employee inquired about his dinner plans, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell a lot of sheets and pillowcases with that attitude right there, my dear.\u201d\n</span>\u201cIn life, there\u2019s only one great bridge to the other side,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cThat is a sense of humor.\u201d He sees it as a path toward relevance, and relevance as an alternative to retirement.\nThis fandom keeps him in the mix, Mr. Richie added, rattling off the admirers he often hears about: \u201cMy mama, my daddy, my cousin, my brother, my sister, my aunt loves you.\u201d That fan base has to translate, he said. \u201cSomebody is going to buy a towel and hopefully a sheet.\u201d\n\u201cI would buy anything for Lionel Richie,\u201d said Lisa Stewart, a 49-year-old mother of three from Lexington, Ky, who was attending Mr. Richie\u2019s Las Vegas concert one Saturday evening. She had already shelled out hundreds of dollars for V.I.P. passes in celebration of her coming birthday.\nAlthough she is a lifelong J.C. Penney shopper \u2014 her husband was wearing pants from the chain to the concert \u2014 Ms. Stewart had not heard of Mr. Richie\u2019s bedding line. The possibility excited her. (Later, in an email, she said she saw pieces online and loved them all.)\nOn this particular summer night, Ms. Stewart was part of a crowd that drew people from San Diego and San Antonio, Illinois and Arkansas. For a little less than two hours, a few thousand people stood, if and when they were able, swaying and smiling.\nMr. Richie is a performer as much as he is a singer, cracking dad jokes in between his tried-and-true songs. \u201cThere\u2019s a portion of your life when you realize that you got more years behind you than you do in front of you, so you\u2019re not ashamed,\u201d he said, taking a beat as the crowd laughed, \u201cof telling your children, \u2018Just get out of my face for a minute.\u2019\u201d\nAt another point, he pretended that a drink that was handed to him by a crew member was filled with something strong. (It was Pedialyte).\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Around 10 p</span>.m., after \u201cEasy (Like Sunday Morning),\u201d \u201cWe are the World\u201d and every other Lionel Richie song you maybe forgot he sang, the show was over. He walked offstage, shed his blue sequined \u201cAll Night Long\u201d jacket and climbed into a black S.U.V., waiting to take him to his private plane.\nLionel Richie was going home to sleep in his own bed.\nAdvertisement", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific [articles focused on a single business]": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 41s "}}

He tried to push back on the increase, but the company he rents from wouldn\u2019t budge.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey said: \u2018This is what the market is doing.\u2019\u201d\nMr. McCallum\u2019s experience is echoing across America, as rents shoot higher after a brief pandemic slump, burdening households and fueling overall inflation.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">That is bad news for the Federal Reserve, because it could make today\u2019s uncomfortably rapid price gains last longer.</span> It\u2019s also problematic for the White House because it hits households right in their pocketbooks, diminishing well-being and fueling unhappiness among voters.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The jump in rents stemmed from a frenzy in the market for owned homes.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">People tried to buy as the pandemic took hold in the United States, often searching for extra space, but found that houses were in short supply after years of under-building following the housing crisis.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That dearth of properties has been exacerbated by work stoppages, supply shortages and labor constraints during the coronavirus era, all of which have kept developers from ramping up production to meet demand.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">As buyers bid up prices on single-family homes and condominiums, many people who would have otherwise moved toward homeownership found themselves unable to afford it, increasing demand for apartments and home leases.</span> Rents have been further boosted by the large number of people searching for places with more space and home offices during the pandemic, and as millennials in their late 20s and early to mid-30s look for more autonomy.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cPeople might be looking to move out and on their own after being stuck with roommates during the pandemic,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, an online freelancing marketplace.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s also a possibility that remote work is playing a role here.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Government stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits also helped people amass savings over the course of the pandemic, so they can afford to move.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Personal savings as a share of disposable income popped during the crisis, and while the share has come down toward normal levels, it remains slightly elevated <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9.4 percent</span>, compared with <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 8 percent</span> just before the pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The combination of factors seems to have created a perfect storm that pushed the Consumer Price Index measure of rent <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.5 percent</span> just between August and September, the fastest pace in <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 years</span>.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s a concern for the Fed, because housing prices tend to move slowly and once they go up, they tend to stay up for a while.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Rent data also feed into what is called \u201cowners\u2019 equivalent rent\u201d \u2014 which tries to put a price on how much owners would pay for housing if they hadn\u2019t bought a home.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Together, housing measures make up about a third of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Overall consumer prices have jumped sharply <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbing 5.4 percent</span> in September from the prior year.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Fed officials have been hoping and betting that the move is temporary, but they are watching housing measures carefully as a risk to that outlook.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cMany participants pointed out that the owners\u2019 equivalent rent component of price indexes should be monitored carefully, as rising home prices could lead to upward pressure on rents,\u201d minutes from the Fed\u2019s September meeting, released Wednesday, said.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Rent is less critical to the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the one it officially targets when it shoots <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> annual inflation on average, than it is to the C.P.I.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But it is a big part of people\u2019s experience with prices, so it could help shape their expectations about future cost increases.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Those expectations matter a lot to the Fed.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">If consumers come to anticipate faster inflation, they may begin to demand higher wages to cover their rising expenses.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">As businesses lift prices to cover rising costs, they could set off an upward spiral.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Already, some key measures of inflation outlooks \u2014 notably the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations \u2014 have jumped higher.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The Fed is already preparing to start slowing the large bond purchases it has been making during the pandemic to keep longer-term interest rates low and money flowing around the economy.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">If inflation stays high, the Fed may also come under pressure to raise its policy interest rate, its more traditional and more powerful tool.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">That might slow mortgage lending, cool the housing market and weigh down inflation.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">But doing that would come at a big cost, slowing the labor market when there <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 5 million</span> fewer jobs than before the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">So for now, Fed officials are getting themselves into a position where they can be nimble without signaling that they\u2019re poised to raise rates.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">White House officials are also wrestling with their options for easing housing price pressures.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">President Biden\u2019s economic agenda includes measures that would build more houses and discourage zoning rules that keep new construction at bay.\n</span>Such an intervention would take time \u2014 homes are not built overnight. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">And in the meantime, rents will almost certainly continue moving in the inflation data, which reflect rising housing costs at a long delay.</span> More up-to-date measures of rental pricing pressure produced by Apartment List and Zillow have shown costs climbing in recent months, though many measures of rent and new leases have calmed down somewhat after a red-hot summer.\nThe national median rent has <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 16.4 percent</span> since January, Apartment List said in its September rental report, with monthly growth slowing slightly from its July peak.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">U.S. Inflation & Supply Chain Problems\nCovid\u2019s impact on supply continues.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Price increases that grew out of pandemic-related shutdowns and supply chain disruptions have continued.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Here are some of its effects:\n\u201cThis is still very strong by historical standards \u2014 we\u2019re in off season,\u201d said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s a racecar slowing down ahead of a turn, but it\u2019s still going faster than we ever have in our lives.\u201d\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Whether rent growth speeds up or slows next year may hinge on whether the government support that has given households the financial ability to afford housing gives way to a strong job market.\n</span>\u201cThere\u2019s room to run, for sure,\u201d based on demographics alone, Mr. Ozimek said. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe question is whether the economy is going to go into full employment, or whether there\u2019s a slowdown.\u201d\nRents could heat up as big cities including New York and Los Angeles rebound from the pandemic, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of Redfin.</span> While smaller cities\u2019 rental markets have been hot for months, the median rent in Manhattan climbed for the first time since the start of the pandemic in September, data from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman showed.\n<span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The recovery in the New York area as a whole has been uneven as some families have moved to the city, bidding up prices, while others are struggling to pay, said Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents landlords of mostly rent-stabilized housing.\n</span>\u201cYou have bidding wars for one unit, and then a renter who can\u2019t pay,\u201d he said. <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cA tale of two cities is happening within the same building.\u201d\nDrew Hamrick, the senior vice president of the Colorado Apartment Association, a landlord group, said the rise in rents is not driven by landlords but by market factors.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cLandlords don\u2019t really set the price, consumers set the price,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s musical chairs.\u201d\n<span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Even if there is a pullback in rents next year, today\u2019s suddenly higher housing costs could make for a painful adjustment period.</span> Higher rent costs can reverberate through people\u2019s lives and force tough decisions.\nLuke Martinez, a 27-year-old in Greenville, a town in East Texas, is contemplating buying a trailer and setting his family up on an R.V. lot after learning that he is losing the three-bedroom house he has been renting for <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1,000 per</span> month <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016.</span>\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane the amount of rent, even in this little podunk town,\u201d Mr. Martinez said.\nHe\u2019s looking at paying up <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,500 per</span> month for a new place, which will be tough. After getting laid off at the start of the pandemic, he had been living partly on savings \u2014 padded by an insurance payout after his car was stolen and totaled. He returned to working in automotive repair only this week. His wife had been working the front desk at a hotel until two months ago, but she is now home-schooling their 8-year-old.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">If they end up renting at the higher price, they will most likely afford it by forgoing a new car.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much just scraping by,\u201d he said of his lifestyle.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 28s "}}

Exclamation point,\" said Rick Hohlt, a lobbyist and fundraiser for Republican Party presidential candidates. \"It sure causes concern.\"\nThe Journal tallied speaking fees and donations to Mr. Clinton'<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 1992 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1996 presidential</span> campaigns; the Democratic National Committee during Mr. Clinton's eight years in the White House; Mrs. Clinton's bids for Senate and president; and the family's nonprofit entity\u2014The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\nThe Journal was aided by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks election contributions. The center provided an industry breakdown of campaign donations.\nFinding an exact total is difficult because the Clintons aren't required to make public any details about donations to their foundation. They voluntarily report donor names, however, and donation amounts within broad ranges.\nIn total, the Clintons raised <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between $2 billion</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $3 billion</span> from all sources, including individual donors, corporate contributors and foreign governments, the Journal found. <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Between $1.3 billion</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $2 billion</span> came from industry sources.\nBy comparison, Presidents George H.W.

Bush raised a total <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $2.9 billion</span> for their four presidential bids, their presidential foundations, as well as for the Republican National Committee when they were in the White House.

If he runs, he could challenge Mrs. Clinton's potential dominance of industry donors.\nMrs. Clinton's office didn't comment on the Journal's findings. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton declined to comment, neither confirming nor disputing the findings. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In past interviews, Mrs. Clinton's advisers have said she would neither favor business nor shy away from rooting out Wall Street abuses.\n</span>The donated funds were split among the Clintons' political operations, which <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $1.2 billion</span>; their nonprofit foundation, which collected <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between $750 million</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $1.7 billion</span>; and speaking fees, which totaled <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $100 million</span>.\nNot counting <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $250 million</span> the Clinton foundation has received from foreign donors, at <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 75% of</span> the money arrived in large donations from industry sources, a category defined by federal regulators and the Center for Responsive Politics.
