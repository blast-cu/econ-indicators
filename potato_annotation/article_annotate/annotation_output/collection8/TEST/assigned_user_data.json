She spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her middle name.\nMost users who were interviewed said they got pills by feigning symptoms of A.D.H.D., a disorder marked by severe impulsivity and inattention, to physicians who casually write prescriptions without proper evaluations. Others got them from friends or dealers.\nObtaining or distributing stimulants without a prescription is a federal crime, but the starkest risks of abuse appear to be overdose and addiction.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2013 report</span> by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that emergency room visits related to nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adults 18 to</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 34 tripled</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2005 to</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2011,</span> to <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 23,000.</span>\nThe agency also reported that <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> people entering substance rehabilitation centers cited stimulants as their primary substance of <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">abuse 15 percent</span> more often than in the previous three-year period.\nJust how stimulants like Adderall might improve work performance, and to what extent, remains a matter of scientific debate.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But many young workers insist that using the drugs to increase productivity is on the rise \u2014 and that these are drugs used not to get high, but hired.\n</span>\u201cGiven the increase in rates of abuse in college students over the last decade, it is essential that we understand the outcomes as they leave college and assume adult roles,\u201d Dr. Wilson Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an interview.\nImmediate Impacts\nElizabeth\u2019s sleep tracker was confused. Her nightly rests were so brief, the iPhone software thought they were just naps. It recorded her average sleep over nine months: from 4:17 a.m. until 7:42.\nAfter founding her own health technology company, Elizabeth soon decided that working hard was not enough; she had to work harder, longer. Sleep went from an indulgence to an obstacle.\nSo she went to a psychiatrist and complained that she could not concentrate on work. She received a diagnosis of A.D.H.D. and a prescription for Adderall in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 minutes</span>, she said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cFriends of mine in finance, on Wall Street, were traders and had to start <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 5 in</span> the morning on top of their games \u2014 most of them were taking Adderall,\u201d Elizabeth said.</span> \u201cYou can\u2019t be the one who is the sluggish one.\u201d\nResearchers in the field are quick to caution that, despite stimulants\u2019 reputation as \u201csmart pills,\u201d few studies suggest that they improve a person\u2019s ability to learn or understand. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">But they often improve attention and motivation, particularly for tedious tasks, which can increase productivity \u2014 or at least the appearance of it.\n</span>Some industries have banned the use of stimulants for reasons of safety or fairness. The Federal Aviation Administration forbids pilots to use the medications under any circumstances. Major League Baseball players and other athletes had long abused amphetamines to increase focus and endure exhausting travel schedules, but the drugs are now considered performance-enhancers allowed only with a confirmed A.D.H.D. diagnosis.\nInterviews with people who have misused the pills showed them to be a diverse group. A dentist in eastern Pennsylvania prescribed herself Adderall and other stimulants for years because, she said in a telephone interview, she could <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">see 15 patients</span> a day rather <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 12.</span>\nLisa Deese of Fishers, Ind., said she had abused Adderall as a stay-at-home mother of three for years. The pills, she said, \u201cwere like mommy crack.\u201d\n\u201cI got so much more done during the day,\u201d she added. \u201cI was hooked by my first pill.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">While many studies have assessed the prevalence of misuse among college students, no doctor or researcher contacted for this article could cite a formal assessment of misuse among adults to improve job performance.\n</span>But Dr. Anjan K. Chatterjee, the chairman of neurology at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and an expert in the field of cognitive enhancement, said that even without conclusive data, misuse was undoubtedly rising. \u201cKids who have been using it in high school and college, this is normalized for them,\u201d Dr. Chatterjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal as they enter the work force.\u201d\nA Slow Realization\nSitting in a conference room at Timberline Knolls, the treatment facility, and hearing the details of Elizabeth\u2019s professed harmless misuse of Adderall, a New York native in her mid-20s said pointedly, \u201cThat was <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">me 17 days</span> ago.\u201d\nThe woman said her road to addiction had begun at her East Coast college, where Adderall was readily available from classmates <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $5 or</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $10 a</span> pill, she said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">When her postgraduate job involved extensive early-morning driving and detailed paperwork, she began taking more.</span> She said friends in accounting and teaching were doing the same thing.\n\u201cEverything was just \u2014\u201d she said, snapping her fingers loudly. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cI did my job faster than anybody.</span> I was on a mission, and I was not going to stop until I succeeded and got what I wanted.\u201d\nWhen she became too wired to relax or sleep, she added the tranquilizer Xanax to calm herself. She tried to stop taking Adderall, she said, but \u201cbecame terrified that I couldn\u2019t perform without it.\u201d She turned to alcohol, then cigarettes and other prescription drugs to modulate her intensifying mood swings, before entering Timberline for five weeks.\nThe number of stimulant misusers who become addicted is unclear. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But supply has risen sharply: <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 2.6 million</span> American adults received A.D.H.D. medication in<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> a rise <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53 percent</span> in only four years, according to Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest prescription-drug manager.</span> Use among <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adults 26 to</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 34 almost</span> doubled.\nMost experts say a proper evaluation for the disorder typically requires an extensive inquiry into a patient\u2019s history of impulsivity and inattention. Yet misusers routinely described brief chats with doctors to get a prescription. Two lawyers in Houston said wearing a suit to their appointments guaranteed no scrutiny.\nThose lawyers said they and dozens of young colleagues at their firms had casually traded pills to work into the night and billed hundreds of extra hours a year in the race for partnerships.\nOne said he had originally <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">taken 20 milligrams</span> of Adderall a day, moving up <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 100 milligrams</span> \u2014 almost double the highest dose recommended by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 by getting prescriptions from multiple doctors, a felony in Texas. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">His productivity, he said, thrilled his unquestioning bosses and clients.\n</span>Then came the downside: rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating and acute anxiety due to sleep loss.

When coronavirus exploded, we decided not to go back to our countries (the United States for him, Brazil for me) so we could stay together.\nSince lockdown, we\u2019ve had some very intense conversations, sorting out a lot of our past. Issues of jealousy that were never part of our history suddenly became inescapable. We thought about breaking up. But with no boats out of the island and no flights out of Indonesia, leaving was not an option. Now, almost three months later, we\u2019re crazy serious about each other.\n\u2766\n\u2018My brother and I had a bare-bones relationship\u2019\nCarter Teng,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20\nRaleigh</span>, N.C.\nLiving with her parents and 10-year-old brother, River.\nBefore Covid-19, my brother and I had a bare-bones relationship. With a 10-year age difference, there\u2019s not much we can talk about. But after seeing his addiction to video games since I\u2019ve been home, I\u2019ve entered into the uncharted waters of violently arguing with him about his life\u2019s priorities and then tearfully making up.\nIn just two months, we\u2019ve shared more tears and hugs than the <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 10 years</span> combined. It\u2019s been a time of many firsts \u2014 the first time I had a deep conversation with him, the first time I told him a secret and the first time I told him I love him.\nAfter this pandemic subsides, I want to remain actively involved in my brother\u2019s life. I now feel responsible for his well-being, as much as I imagine a parent cares for their child. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Maybe I won\u2019t take a job on the west coast after graduation; maybe I\u2019ll stay on the East Coast to be close.\n</span>\u2766\n\u2018We have grieved, grown and healed\u2019\nKelly Sterling,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32\nBrooklyn</span>\nLiving with her husband, Randy.\nBefore entering this quarantine, my husband and I suffered a miscarriage. I had a dilation and curettage procedure a week before New York City shut down. We had to adjust quickly to our new reality: staying home, losing a pregnancy and my husband getting laid off. I had a hard time sleeping. I\u2019d wake up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3 a</span>.m. on the couch. My husband would find me in the morning and we\u2019d just sit there, holding each other.\nMy husband is resilient. I would snap at him for being positive about the future or hopeful that we will get pregnant again, feeling like it was too soon. I realized that\u2019s just him, though. Positivity is how he grieves.\nThe last couple of months have allowed us time to grieve in a way we normally wouldn\u2019t have. I was scheduled to return to work a few days after the procedure.\nWe started having conversations with our families and friends, opening up about what had happened. People told us stories of their own losses and their friends\u2019 losses. Even though we were stuck at home, we felt love and support from the outside world. Randy and I have come a long way during this time \u2014 now, we accept our loss as part of our story.\n\u2766\n\u2018More than sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019\nKellie Krueger,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32\nLos</span> Angeles\nLiving with her boyfriend, Tony, who moved into her studio apartment.\nWe went from seeing each other on weekends at goth and rock clubs \u2014 and enjoying maybe one lazy day after \u2014 to this. We actually haven\u2019t fought much. So many L.A. relationships are superficial, and I sometimes feared ours was too. But it\u2019s not. Our proximity has proved to me than our relationship is more than sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\nOverall, we communicate more deeply than we did before this pandemic. The best part has been learning more about each other\u2019s true nature. When I\u2019m feeling down, I don\u2019t need to speak or explain. Tony reaches his arms out to hold me and suggests we take a drive to see the ocean.\nOur one-year anniversary is today, but we\u2019ve chosen to take a week apart for personal space. It feels healthy and right, because my apartment is so small.\n\u2766\n\u2018We\u2019re still getting to know each other\u2019\nNatasha Scripture,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42\nFrederick</span>, Md.\nLiving with her fianc\u00e9, Ali, and their daughter Layla.\nWe got pregnant the first time we had sex, after knowing each other briefly.

We are learning what it means to be a team \u2026 and struggling to be one, too.\nI\u2019m alone with the baby most of the day while he works, in another section of the house, sometimes treating coronavirus patients via telemedicine. When the baby naps, I have to get my writing done. It is sacred, fleeting time. My partner has learned not to come near me during those moments or I\u2019ll kill him.\n\u2766\n\u2018Look, I made us masks from these old socks!\u2019\nLou Storey,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 65\nLong</span> Branch, N.J.\nLiving with his husband, Steve.\nOur personalities have become amplified in quarantine. Steve became hyper-efficient, harnessing YouTube-inspired homesteading wisdom: \u201cLook, I made us masks from these old socks!\u201d I sit for long stretches (minutes, hours, days?) looking out the window, sighing, saying \u201cRemember when \u2026?\u201d\nI have these conversations with Rufus, our patient cat, while Steve researches which trees have edible leaves. So, I suppose Steve would say, \u201cLou fell apart during the crisis while I saved the day!\u201d\n\u2766\n\u2018<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">my 13 brothers</span></span> and sisters and I decided to return to Ohio\u2019\nCaroline Driscoll,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23\nSalem</span>, Ohio\nLiving with her parents, siblings, brother-in-law and two nephews.\nBefore the travel advisories were issued in early March, <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">my 13 brothers</span></span> and sisters and I decided to return to Ohio and isolate in our childhood home. We have never all lived together at once.\nBefore coronavirus, we would only see each other for a couple days at a time, a few times a year. Hurt feelings used to go unaddressed for fear of ruining the little time we had together.\nNow, there\u2019s no excuse to ignore something that\u2019s bothering us, talk it out and resolve it. There\u2019s also no way to avoid one another given the close quarters; some of us are sharing beds with other siblings.\nWe\u2019re learning more about each other. I feel like I\u2019m meeting my siblings for the first time. I knew them as children, and now I have the honor of getting to know them as adults.\n\u2766\n\u2018We\u2019ve started arguing in British accents\u2019\nKendra Peart,<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24\nDelray</span> Beach, Fla.\nLiving with her boyfriend, Benjamin.\nOur biggest argument was after I asked him to help more with chores and he called me a nag. Not sure why, but that triggered me and we didn\u2019t talk for a day. We just awkwardly avoided each other around the house.\nHe apologized later and we talked about shared responsibility and watched a movie. But the day we didn\u2019t talk was refreshing. The space was more important than we realized. We\u2019ve recently started arguing in British accents in order to avoid taking the little things too seriously.\n\u2766\n\u2018We sing and dance like teenagers\u2019\nDuBose Forrest,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68\nLafayette</span>, Calif.\nLiving with her husband of four months, Chris.\nWe have both arrived at the age where there\u2019s no time for fussing and fighting. He may occasionally be short with me if he is stressed because of work or misunderstandings, but I let it go. Similarly, he is very understanding and calms me when I\u2019m upset.\nBecause we have so much more time together, we indulge in sex almost daily, and the fact that he can and that I want to has amazed me. Even better, he comes out of the study throughout his work day to kiss me, and makes a point of starting his day exercising with me and ending it snuggling. We sing and dance like teenagers.\n\u2766\n\u2018Losing the will to take off our sweatpants\u2019\nLiz Carroll,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 52\nSeattle</span>\nLiving with her husband, Dorion.\nAs the months go on, we\u2019re sort of losing the will to take off our sweatpants. My husband clips his toenails much more frequently than I was previously aware. His offer to make dinner once every three weeks has not changed even though we now cook every meal at home. He really doesn\u2019t want to watch \u201cwhatever\u201d I want even if he claims he doesn\u2019t care.\nThat said, our relationship is rock solid. We are dying to travel more and realize that where we live doesn\u2019t really matter. We could ditch this apartment, get a mail forwarding system and live anywhere.\n\u2766\n\u2018Our good communication has broken down\u2019\nAmber Elliot,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30\nAberdeen</span> Township, N.J.\nLiving with her boyfriend and their two cats.\nBefore this, we rarely raised our voices and were both quick to apologize. It seems our good communication has broken down. Usually we are both noncombative, but when you have to face a harsh reality every day, it\u2019s hard to ignore or make excuses.\nHe always said a major reason for the distance in our relationship was that I worked too much. But now that we have all of this time together, it\u2019s been detrimental to our relationship. There have been a few bright spots. I was having a bad day and he knew I had been craving a McFlurry, so he went out and got one for me with extra M&Ms. It reminds me to keep the compassion alive.\nBut when our lease is up, we will not be living together anymore, and I will be moving across the country. This time has been revealing not only for my relationship but for the whole structure and meaning of my life.\n\u2766\n\u2018When I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going\u2019\nApril Friges,<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38\nPittsburgh</span>\nLiving with her 2\u00bd-year-old daughter.\nI\u2019m a single mom. My daughter splits half her time with her father, but the hardest day was when I allowed her to watch television for five hours so I could work, but I really just sat on the floor staring, unable to do anything.\nI\u2019m a professor at a university, and it was difficult just ending the semester, without support or day care. Things got really tough. But I found that when I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going.\n\u2766\n\u2018The perfect time to create something new\u2019\nAriana Shapiro,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 26\nNew</span> Haven, Conn.\nLiving with her boyfriend, who will join her lease in June.\nI get lost on endless Zoom calls. Some days I hear a sharp knock on the door of my home office and look up to see my boyfriend mooning me, his cheeks pressed tight against the glass door, just out of sight of the camera. It lifts my spirits.\nIn March we started collecting food from our neighbors and distributing it to families in need. We weren\u2019t ready to move in before, but we are now. We started a mutual aid network together and we talk about what\u2019s next: A worker\u2019s cooperative? A political campaign? A nonprofit? We realized that this is the perfect time to create something new.\nEdited by Jessica Bennett, Daniel Jones, Miya Lee and Anya Strzemien, with photo editing by Eve Lyons.\nModern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.\nWant more from Modern Love?

Add months of isolation, the physical and emotional toll of a pandemic, followed by global protests, and this period we\u2019re living through has the capacity to reshape relationships on a broad scale.\nRather than publishing one story this week, we decided to try to capture a bigger picture by featuring numerous voices. We wanted to know how people who are living together \u2014 romantically or otherwise \u2014 have fared with so much time together. Will this era be more about the costs of claustrophobia or the deepening of love? What about the fights? The annoying habits? The romance? The chaos? Here <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 18 stories</span> of isolating together.\n\u2766\n\u2018I have to lock the bathroom\u2019\nErin Gallagher,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38\nChicago</span>\nLiving with her husband, Brian, their two sons, as well as her mother and dog.\nI learned that space and time away from my husband and children is good for everyone, especially me. My husband has started saying \u201cwoo!\u201d to everything in quarantine, and it makes me want to scream. My children are amazing and empathetic and annoying. I have to lock the bathroom or they climb into the shower with me or stand next to me while I\u2019m on the toilet. Small breaks: riding the Peloton with headphones on, taking a bath, solo walks, drives to Starbucks and Target runs.\n\u2766\n\u2018I never fought with my grandparents\u2019\nRachelle Olden,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 36\nColumbia</span>, S.C.\nLiving with her grandparents Ann and Charles. She\u2019ll return to her home in Seattle soon.\nI never fought with my grandparents, but three months of quarantine can change any relationship. Arguments with my grandmother started over my dog\u2019s ban from the kitchen, then moved to the mistakes I\u2019m making in my love life and on to the length of my summer dresses.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Lately we\u2019ve been arguing about the approach to the Black Lives Matter protests: My grandmother\u2019s experience as a Black woman in America, born in rural South Carolina to sharecropping parents, is extremely different from my own, as a Duke University-educated and Microsoft-employed Black woman.</span> I am her wildest dream.\nWe debate how Black Americans protest police brutality and systemic racism. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">She wants me to stay home, away from the tear gas and rubber bullets, and not speak so candidly to my white colleagues, for fear that I\u2019ll lose my corporate job.</span> I believe the consequences of a peaceful protest don\u2019t outweigh the necessity to make my voice heard.\nI moved in with my grandparents after a long-term relationship with my middle school sweetheart ended abruptly in March. I\u2019ve tried online dating \u2014 my grandmother swipes on my behalf. I went on a social-distanced date and my grandmother critiqued every outfit.\nMy grandparents have a 57-year marriage. I thought they had marriage figured out and could teach me, but they don\u2019t. They argue and act childish like most couples. I guess I\u2019m on my own with this marriage thing.\nThey would probably say living with me for the past three months is the best Covid-19 gift. I not only grocery shop but also introduced them to streaming church on YouTube. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They don\u2019t understand \u201cworking from home\u201d and therefore think I\u2019m unemployed.</span> They\u2019re sad to see me go.\n[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]\n\u2766\n\u2018The sense of someone near is comforting.\u2019\nLilian Howard,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 83\nVirginia</span> Beach, Va.\nLiving with Lydia, her 24-year-old roommate.\nUnlike many millennials in my experience, Lydia is a great cook, has a real curiosity about a huge number of things, and is tidy and even-tempered. She defers to me on all household matters, which certainly helps us get along.\nNow, during the pandemic, we take our evening meals together, very often with a ballet, opera or theater event streamed from somewhere in the world. We sometimes like to admire attractive men on the TV. Having a roommate helps with expenses \u2014 and the sense of someone near is comforting.\n\u2766\n\u2018I learned that I could rely on my husband \u2014 briefly\u2019\nCandace Fujii,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31\nAsaka</span>, Japan\nLiving with her husband, Taiki, and their toddler.\nI was sick for two weeks in April, though I didn\u2019t get tested for the coronavirus. I learned that I could rely on my husband \u2014 briefly. It took two weeks for him to go from very willing to pitch in to noticeably irritated that I wasn\u2019t <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">feeling 100 percent</span> yet.\nThere was a dark period during my illness where I wished I was back in my parents\u2019 New England home, with no neighbors around, roaming the woods with my child. I realized that ache will never go away and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\nHaving a baby in a society that already put much of the child care on the shoulders of the mother, working or not, did in most of our romance long ago. I have also started to feel twinges of anxiety about my decision not to go back to work. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">I don\u2019t regret the choice to stay home with my baby, but job hunting looks even more bleak post-quarantine.\n</span>\u2766\n\u2018Yes, we\u2019re still living in the yurt'\nDavid Mielke,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57\nVashon</span> Island, Wash.\nLiving with his husband, Tom.\nMy husband and I rented a 20-foot <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">yurt 11 years</span> ago because we knew it would either teach us to be good communicators or reveal that we were better suited to monkhood. We thought if our marriage could survive sharing such a small space, it could survive anything.\nSince social isolation began, we wanted a creative way to deal with conflicts. So we\u2019ve been collaborating on \u201cBroadway in the Yurt\u201d \u2014 classic show tunes with a twist. The song \u201cMood-Altering Foods\u201d \u2014 a twist on \u201cFood Glorious Food\u201d from the musical \u201cOliver\u201d \u2014 was born out of my penchant for comfort foods when stressed and Tom feeling that maybe it wasn\u2019t the healthiest way of dealing with things.\nWe\u2019ve learned that the only thing more conducive to growth than living in a yurt is living in a yurt during quarantine.\n\u2766\n\u2018We were supposed to be here for three days\u2019\nBianca Carminati,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 34\nGili</span> Meno, Indonesia\nLiving with her boyfriend, Eduardo.\nMy boyfriend and I are accidentally living on an island in Indonesia; we were supposed to be here for just three days when lockdown happened. The island is mostly deserted \u2014 virtually all tourists have left, so we are alone all the time.\nEduardo and I had been having a nonexclusive, long-distance relationship for two years and decided to travel around Southeast Asia. When coronavirus exploded, we decided not to go back to our countries (the United States for him, Brazil for me) so we could stay together.\nSince lockdown, we\u2019ve had some very intense conversations, sorting out a lot of our past. Issues of jealousy that were never part of our history suddenly became inescapable. We thought about breaking up. But with no boats out of the island and no flights out of Indonesia, leaving was not an option.

We\u2019ve recently started arguing in British accents in order to avoid taking the little things too seriously.\n\u2766\n\u2018We sing and dance like teenagers\u2019\nDuBose Forrest,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68\nLafayette</span>, Calif.\nLiving with her husband of four months, Chris.\nWe have both arrived at the age where there\u2019s no time for fussing and fighting. He may occasionally be short with me if he is stressed because of work or misunderstandings, but I let it go. Similarly, he is very understanding and calms me when I\u2019m upset.\nBecause we have so much more time together, we indulge in sex almost daily, and the fact that he can and that I want to has amazed me. Even better, he comes out of the study throughout his work day to kiss me, and makes a point of starting his day exercising with me and ending it snuggling. We sing and dance like teenagers.\n\u2766\n\u2018Losing the will to take off our sweatpants\u2019\nLiz Carroll,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 52\nSeattle</span>\nLiving with her husband, Dorion.\nAs the months go on, we\u2019re sort of losing the will to take off our sweatpants. My husband clips his toenails much more frequently than I was previously aware. His offer to make dinner once every three weeks has not changed even though we now cook every meal at home. He really doesn\u2019t want to watch \u201cwhatever\u201d I want even if he claims he doesn\u2019t care.\nThat said, our relationship is rock solid. We are dying to travel more and realize that where we live doesn\u2019t really matter. We could ditch this apartment, get a mail forwarding system and live anywhere.\n\u2766\n\u2018Our good communication has broken down\u2019\nAmber Elliot,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30\nAberdeen</span> Township, N.J.\nLiving with her boyfriend and their two cats.\nBefore this, we rarely raised our voices and were both quick to apologize. It seems our good communication has broken down. Usually we are both noncombative, but when you have to face a harsh reality every day, it\u2019s hard to ignore or make excuses.\nHe always said a major reason for the distance in our relationship was that I worked too much. But now that we have all of this time together, it\u2019s been detrimental to our relationship. There have been a few bright spots. I was having a bad day and he knew I had been craving a McFlurry, so he went out and got one for me with extra M&Ms. It reminds me to keep the compassion alive.\nBut when our lease is up, we will not be living together anymore, and I will be moving across the country. This time has been revealing not only for my relationship but for the whole structure and meaning of my life.\n\u2766\n\u2018When I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going\u2019\nApril Friges,<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38\nPittsburgh</span>\nLiving with her 2\u00bd-year-old daughter.\nI\u2019m a single mom. My daughter splits half her time with her father, but the hardest day was when I allowed her to watch television for five hours so I could work, but I really just sat on the floor staring, unable to do anything.\nI\u2019m a professor at a university, and it was difficult just ending the semester, without support or day care. Things got really tough. But I found that when I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going.\n\u2766\n\u2018The perfect time to create something new\u2019\nAriana Shapiro,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 26\nNew</span> Haven, Conn.\nLiving with her boyfriend, who will join her lease in June.\nI get lost on endless Zoom calls. Some days I hear a sharp knock on the door of my home office and look up to see my boyfriend mooning me, his cheeks pressed tight against the glass door, just out of sight of the camera. It lifts my spirits.\nIn March we started collecting food from our neighbors and distributing it to families in need. We weren\u2019t ready to move in before, but we are now. We started a mutual aid network together and we talk about what\u2019s next: A worker\u2019s cooperative? A political campaign? A nonprofit? We realized that this is the perfect time to create something new.\nEdited by Jessica Bennett, Daniel Jones, Miya Lee and Anya Strzemien, with photo editing by Eve Lyons.\nModern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.\nWant more from Modern Love?

Moments before his flight was due to land, Mr. Trump took aim at the mayor, Sadiq Khan, calling him a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d in a series of posts. He then went on to compare him to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York.\n....<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height.</span> In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 3,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019\nMr</span>. Trump has feuded with the mayor before. When large protests greeted the president in London during a visit last year, Mr. Khan allowed demonstrators to fly a giant orange balloon of Mr. Trump depicted as a baby in diapers. The blimp\u2019s creator told news outlets on Sunday that the mayor had granted permission for the balloon to fly again this time round.\nDays before Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, Mr. Khan wrote an article published online on Saturday by The Observer saying: \u201cIt\u2019s too late to stop the red-carpet treatment, but it\u2019s not too late for the prime minister to do the right thing. Theresa May should issue a powerful rejection \u2014 not of the U.S. as a country or the office of the presidency, but of Trump and the far-right agenda he embodies.\u201d\nMr. Trump will spend three days in Britain, first traveling to the American ambassador\u2019s residence in London before heading on to Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. He will then attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster Abbey, have tea with Prince Charles, and attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, he will meet with the departing prime minister, Theresa May, at her London residence and hold a joint news conference.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump will travel to the southern city of Portsmouth for a D-Day commemoration. He will then fly to Ireland on Wednesday afternoon, where he will meet with that country\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and stay overnight at the Trump International golf course in Doonbeg.\nMr. Trump arrives just as Mrs. May\u2019s tenure as party leader is ending.\nAfter two years of delay, friction and awkwardness, Buckingham Palace announced a date for President Trump\u2019s state visit this past April, after Prime Minister Theresa May conveyed the queen\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump. He arrived in London on Monday \u2014 days before Mrs. May is to step down as leader of the Conservative Party.\nWhen Mr. Trump did make his first visit to London as president, in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2018,</span> it had been downgraded to a working trip, without the pageantry. Mr. Trump was received by Mrs. May, Queen Elizabeth II and protesters. He criticized the prime minister\u2019s approach to Brexit and took a weekend detour to a golf course he owns in Scotland.\nThis time, Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for uncensored opinions is likely to capture more headlines, if history is any guide. The turbulence has already started. As he did last year, before arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump spoke to The Sun tabloid and The Sunday Times \u2014 Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers \u2014 wading into the country\u2019s political and social affairs and firing criticism at prominent officials.\nComments from Woody Johnson, the American ambassador to Britain, are likely to complicate matters. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, Mr. Johnson said that all parts of the British economy would be \u201con the table\u201d in discussions over trade, including the National Health Service and agriculture.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The possibility of chlorine-washed chickens from the United States has emerged as a symbol of British concerns about a post-Brexit trade deal, but Mr. Johnson indicated that the United States would insist on access.</span> \u201cYou give the British people a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they like it, they can buy it. If they don\u2019t want it, they don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d\nState visits serve as diplomatic bonanzas for the British government, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to have tea with Prince Charles, hold talks with Mrs. May and attend a banquet with the queen, among other events.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In April, Mrs. May called the visit \u201can opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship\u201d on issues such as trade, investment and security.\n</span>Weeks later, Mrs. May said she would resign, after nearly three years of trying but failing to shepherd Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. The contest to succeed her will begin on Friday, after she steps down as leader of the Conservative Party.\nThe president has been barred from speaking at Parliament.\nJohn Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has said that he would not allow Mr. Trump to address Parliament, as other leaders \u2014 including Presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, President Xi Jinping of China and former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa \u2014 have done.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> Mr. Bercow said Mr. Trump had \u201cnot earned\u201d the honor of speaking to Parliament, and has so far resisted calls to let the president speak. Mr. Bercow has also declined an invitation to the banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday night, a spokeswoman for his office said.\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, also declined an invitation to the state dinner. Unlike Mr. Bercow, he elaborated on his decision in a statement in April.\n\u201cTheresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cMaintaining an important relationship with the United States does not require the pomp and ceremony of a state visit.\u201d\nIn The Sun interview, the president said he thought that the Labour leader was making a mistake. \u201cI think he would want to get along with the United States\u201d if he were to become Britain\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said.\nHe will meet the queen for the second time.\nThe world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 93,</span> has <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">met 12 American</span> presidents, starting with President Harry S. Truman when she was a princess and heir to the throne. Last year, she sat for tea with Mr. Trump \u2014 who with the first lady, Melania Trump, appeared not to follow long-running protocol in which a bow or curtsy is customary.\nOne awkward moment, in particular, caught the eye of social media users: While they inspected her honor guard, the queen gestured to Mr. Trump and appeared to direct him forward.

Moments before his flight was due to land, Mr. Trump took aim at the mayor, Sadiq Khan, calling him a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d in a series of posts. He then went on to compare him to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York.\n....<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height.</span> In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 3,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019\nMr</span>. Trump has feuded with the mayor before. When large protests greeted the president in London during a visit last year, Mr. Khan allowed demonstrators to fly a giant orange balloon of Mr. Trump depicted as a baby in diapers. The blimp\u2019s creator told news outlets on Sunday that the mayor had granted permission for the balloon to fly again this time round.\nDays before Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, Mr. Khan wrote an article published online on Saturday by The Observer saying: \u201cIt\u2019s too late to stop the red-carpet treatment, but it\u2019s not too late for the prime minister to do the right thing. Theresa May should issue a powerful rejection \u2014 not of the U.S. as a country or the office of the presidency, but of Trump and the far-right agenda he embodies.\u201d\nMr. Trump will spend three days in Britain, first traveling to the American ambassador\u2019s residence in London before heading on to Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. He will then attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster Abbey, have tea with Prince Charles, and attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, he will meet with the departing prime minister, Theresa May, at her London residence and hold a joint news conference.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump will travel to the southern city of Portsmouth for a D-Day commemoration. He will then fly to Ireland on Wednesday afternoon, where he will meet with that country\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and stay overnight at the Trump International golf course in Doonbeg.\nMr. Trump arrives just as Mrs. May\u2019s tenure as party leader is ending.\nAfter two years of delay, friction and awkwardness, Buckingham Palace announced a date for President Trump\u2019s state visit this past April, after Prime Minister Theresa May conveyed the queen\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump. He arrived in London on Monday \u2014 days before Mrs. May is to step down as leader of the Conservative Party.\nWhen Mr. Trump did make his first visit to London as president, in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2018,</span> it had been downgraded to a working trip, without the pageantry. Mr. Trump was received by Mrs. May, Queen Elizabeth II and protesters. He criticized the prime minister\u2019s approach to Brexit and took a weekend detour to a golf course he owns in Scotland.\nThis time, Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for uncensored opinions is likely to capture more headlines, if history is any guide. The turbulence has already started. As he did last year, before arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump spoke to The Sun tabloid and The Sunday Times \u2014 Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers \u2014 wading into the country\u2019s political and social affairs and firing criticism at prominent officials.\nComments from Woody Johnson, the American ambassador to Britain, are likely to complicate matters. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, Mr. Johnson said that all parts of the British economy would be \u201con the table\u201d in discussions over trade, including the National Health Service and agriculture.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The possibility of chlorine-washed chickens from the United States has emerged as a symbol of British concerns about a post-Brexit trade deal, but Mr. Johnson indicated that the United States would insist on access.</span> \u201cYou give the British people a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they like it, they can buy it. If they don\u2019t want it, they don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d\nState visits serve as diplomatic bonanzas for the British government, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to have tea with Prince Charles, hold talks with Mrs. May and attend a banquet with the queen, among other events.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In April, Mrs. May called the visit \u201can opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship\u201d on issues such as trade, investment and security.\n</span>Weeks later, Mrs. May said she would resign, after nearly three years of trying but failing to shepherd Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. The contest to succeed her will begin on Friday, after she steps down as leader of the Conservative Party.\nThe president has been barred from speaking at Parliament.\nJohn Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has said that he would not allow Mr. Trump to address Parliament, as other leaders \u2014 including Presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, President Xi Jinping of China and former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa \u2014 have done.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> Mr. Bercow said Mr. Trump had \u201cnot earned\u201d the honor of speaking to Parliament, and has so far resisted calls to let the president speak. Mr. Bercow has also declined an invitation to the banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday night, a spokeswoman for his office said.\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, also declined an invitation to the state dinner. Unlike Mr. Bercow, he elaborated on his decision in a statement in April.\n\u201cTheresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cMaintaining an important relationship with the United States does not require the pomp and ceremony of a state visit.\u201d\nIn The Sun interview, the president said he thought that the Labour leader was making a mistake. \u201cI think he would want to get along with the United States\u201d if he were to become Britain\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said.\nHe will meet the queen for the second time.\nThe world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 93,</span> has <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">met 12 American</span> presidents, starting with President Harry S. Truman when she was a princess and heir to the throne. Last year, she sat for tea with Mr. Trump \u2014 who with the first lady, Melania Trump, appeared not to follow long-running protocol in which a bow or curtsy is customary.\nOne awkward moment, in particular, caught the eye of social media users: While they inspected her honor guard, the queen gestured to Mr. Trump and appeared to direct him forward. But he walked in front of her and then stopped, cutting off her path and forcing her to sidestep around him.\nThis year, Mr. Trump is scheduled to take tea with Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Harry is expected to join them for a private lunch with Mr. Trump, according to the BBC, and Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, will attend the state banquet on Monday evening.\nThe BBC also reported that Prince Harry\u2019s wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex \u2014 who is on maternity leave after giving birth to the couple\u2019s first child last month \u2014 would not be attending the dinner.\nIn The Sun interview, when the president was told that <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 the</span> former actress, an American, threatened to move to Canada if he were elected president, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was nasty.\u201d Still, he said he thought it was nice to have an American princess, adding, \u201cI am sure she will do excellently.\u201d\nMr. Trump may meet with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.\nMrs. May\u2019s rivals have already begun angling to succeed her, and the field is crowded.\nThe apparent front-runner is Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister and supporter of Brexit.

Incentives, land, the environment, the workers,\u201d Zhu Shanqing, Keer\u2019s chairman, said on a recent trip to the United States.\n\u201cIn China, the whole yarn manufacturing industry is losing money,\u201d he added. \u201cIn America, it\u2019s very different.\u201d\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Since Beijing and Washington resumed trade relations in the early 1970s, the United States has mostly run a huge trade deficit, as Americans consumed billions of dollars in cheap electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But surging labor and energy costs in China are eroding its competitiveness in manufacturing.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">According to the Boston Consulting Group, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have almost tripled in China over the last decade, to an <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $12.47 an</span> hour last year <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $4.35 an</span> hour <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004.</span>\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 percent</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2004,</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $22.32 an</span> hour, according to the consulting firm.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies.\n</span>Today, for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">every $1 required</span> to manufacture in the United States, Boston Consulting estimates that it <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs 96 cents</span> to manufacture in China. Yarn production costs in China are <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">now 30 percent</span> higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.\n\u201cEverybody believed that China would always be cheaper,\u201d said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. \u201cBut things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.\u201d\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Rising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.</span> In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.\nIn recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2000 to</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> Chinese companies <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invested $46 billion</span> on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.\nThe Carolinas are now home to at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 Chinese</span> manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cI never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,\u201d said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $20 million</span>, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The inner workings of Keer\u2019s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.\n</span>Inside <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 230,000</span>-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.\nThe work is highly automated, with the factory\u2019<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 32 production</span> lines churning out <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 85 tons</span> of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 500 workers</span>, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries \u2014 a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.\nThe spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts \u2014 as long as the yarn is made in a member country.\n</span>Sheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cCommon sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cNow some of that is reversed.\u201d\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that \u201cit\u2019s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.\u201d\n</span>Investment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $70 million</span> factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area\u2019s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012 that</span> it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.\n\u201cThe whole textile world is looking at us,\u201d Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.\nFor residents of South Carolina, Keer\u2019s arrival could not have come soon enough. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world\u2019s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The global economic crisis hit soon afterward.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">By <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2009,</span> Lancaster County\u2019s unemployment rate had <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 18.6 percent</span>.\n</span>\u201cThey shut them down one by one,\u201d said Donnie R. Gordon, who <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 17 years</span> weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">But shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases.</span> Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to like it here,\u201d said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni\u2019s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer\u2019s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.\nKeer\u2019s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer\u2019s American prospects.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.\n</span>Then there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15 Chinese</span> trainers at Keer\u2019s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers\u2019 occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.\nRobbie Sowers, a 32-year textile industry veteran who maintains the plant\u2019s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes\u2019 leeway before calling them late.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.\u201d\nAs she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100,</span> how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators.

Yarn production costs in China are <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">now 30 percent</span> higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.\n\u201cEverybody believed that China would always be cheaper,\u201d said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. \u201cBut things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.\u201d\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Rising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.</span> In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.\nIn recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2000 to</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> Chinese companies <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invested $46 billion</span> on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.\nThe Carolinas are now home to at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 Chinese</span> manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cI never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,\u201d said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $20 million</span>, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The inner workings of Keer\u2019s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.\n</span>Inside <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 230,000</span>-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.\nThe work is highly automated, with the factory\u2019<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 32 production</span> lines churning out <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 85 tons</span> of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 500 workers</span>, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries \u2014 a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.\nThe spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts \u2014 as long as the yarn is made in a member country.\n</span>Sheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cCommon sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cNow some of that is reversed.\u201d\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that \u201cit\u2019s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.\u201d\n</span>Investment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $70 million</span> factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area\u2019s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012 that</span> it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.\n\u201cThe whole textile world is looking at us,\u201d Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.\nFor residents of South Carolina, Keer\u2019s arrival could not have come soon enough. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world\u2019s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The global economic crisis hit soon afterward.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">By <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2009,</span> Lancaster County\u2019s unemployment rate had <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 18.6 percent</span>.\n</span>\u201cThey shut them down one by one,\u201d said Donnie R. Gordon, who <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 17 years</span> weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">But shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases.</span> Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to like it here,\u201d said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni\u2019s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer\u2019s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.\nKeer\u2019s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer\u2019s American prospects.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.\n</span>Then there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15 Chinese</span> trainers at Keer\u2019s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers\u2019 occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.\nRobbie Sowers, a 32-year textile industry veteran who maintains the plant\u2019s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes\u2019 leeway before calling them late.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.\u201d\nAs she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100,</span> how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators.

Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the regiment, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, we are under constant shelling,\u201d with attacks from Russian tanks, artillery, airplanes and snipers.\nThe remaining civilians in the steel plant were evacuated on Saturday.

However, the Ukrainian army withdrew from the city of Popasna after two months of fierce fighting.\nIn general, the planned Russian offensive in the east of the country, like the rest of Mr. Putin\u2019s war, has gone less well than planned. Mr. Putin\u2019s broad aim, at least for the time being, seems to be to connect Crimea through Mariupol to other occupied areas in eastern Ukraine, and to Russia itself, forming a cohesive and strategic swath of territory.\nWilliam J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the current phase of the war was at least as dangerous as Russia\u2019s initial attempt to attack the capital and topple the Ukrainian government.\nSpeaking on Saturday in Washington, he said Mr. Putin was \u201cin a frame of mind that he thinks he cannot afford to lose,\u201d and was convinced that \u201cdoubling down still will enable him to make progress.\u201d\nIn <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 77 years</span> since the end of World War II, the possibility of a broad conflagration in Europe has seldom, if ever, appeared more plausible.\nReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola in London; Eduardo Medina in New York; Marc Santora in Krakow, Poland; Maria Varenikova in Kyiv, Ukraine; Katie Rogers in Uzhhorod, Ukraine; Julian E.

For the millions of members of China\u2019s diaspora, it is the bridge that links them to the trappings of home, from family chatter to food photos.\nWoven through it all is the ever more muscular surveillance and propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party. As WeChat has become ubiquitous, it has become a powerful tool of social control, a way for Chinese authorities to guide and police what people say, whom they talk to and what they read.\nIt has even extended Beijing\u2019s reach beyond its borders.

Kaplan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, joined him in dissenting. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Kaplan did so for a very different reason: He wanted the central bank to retain more flexibility, rather than indicating that actual achievement <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 percent</span> inflation was a necessary condition for raising rates.</span> That would create leeway to raise rates earlier.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The statement revamp came after the Fed reworked its long-run policy goals last month, making changes that would embrace periods of faster inflation and which enshrined modesty when it came to judging labor market hotness.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey\u2019re sort of on two sides of the discussion,\u201d Jerome H.

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span></span> He was living with his wife and two sons in suburban Nashville when his probation officer called his landlord and informed him that Winters was a registered sex offender.\nThe previous year, when he <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 24 years</span> old, Winters had been arrested for downloading a three-minute porn clip. The file description said the girl in the video was 16; the prosecutor said she <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 14.</span> He was charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a minor and, because he had used file-sharing software to download the video, attempted distribution of child pornography.\nWinters had no criminal record, no history of contact with children and no other illegal files on his computer. Facing an eight-year prison sentence, he had taken a plea deal that gave him six years\u2019 probation <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 15 years</span> on Tennessee\u2019s sex offender registry.\nThe day after his landlord found all this out, Winters found a letter on his porch giving him and his <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">family 72 hours</span> to move out. He ended up in one homeless shelter, his wife and sons in another.\nHe had no idea that it would be the last time he would ever live in a home. He has been sleeping in shelters, halfway houses and parked cars ever since.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019ve lost everything so many times,\u201d said Winters, who asked HuffPost not to use his real name due to concerns that it would add to the difficulty of finding housing and employment.\n</span>His years on the registry have been an exercise in hitting rock bottom and then falling even further down. He has attempted suicide twice and checked himself into inpatient psychiatric facilities three times. The strain of living apart from his family eventually ended his marriage. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Without an income to help keep his family afloat, his now-ex-wife had no choice but to take the kids and move back in with her parents in Ohio.</span> Winters can\u2019t visit without approval from his probation officer and can\u2019t afford the bus fare very often anyway, so he only sees his sons a few times per year. <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">At 29,</span> he still <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">h<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 10 years</span></span> left before his name comes off the registry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even forge relationships anymore,\u201d Winters said. \u201cPeople are judgmental, so I keep to myself. I go to work, I go to sleep and I try not to think about what\u2019s going to take everything away the next time.\u201d\nWinters is a member of an expanding and invisible American underclass. <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1994,</span> when Congress passed the first sex offender registration law, the list was reserved for law enforcement officials and only applied to the most serious offenders. Since then, American lawmakers at every level have relentlessly increased its scope and severity.\nThe registry now includes more <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 900,000 people</span>, a population slightly greater than Vermont\u2019s. At <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 states</span> require sex offender registration for public urination; five apply it to people charged with offenses related to sex work;<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 29 require</span> it for consensual sex between teenagers. According to Human Rights Watch, people have been forced to spend decades on the registry for crimes they committed as young <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 10 years</span> old.\n\u201cWhen we first started talking about registering sex offenders it seemed like a good idea,\u201d said Jill Levenson, a Barry University researcher and social worker who has published more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 articles</span> about sexual abuse. \u201cBut now the net has widened. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They\u2019re for life, there\u2019s no mechanism to come off and there\u2019s more restrictions on employment, housing and travel.\u201d\n</span>The conditions imposed on registered sex offenders have become significantly more draconian over time. More <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 states</span> now require registrants to live at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 1,000 feet</span> away from schools, churches and other places children congregate \u2014 a requirement that renders up <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 99% of</span> homes and apartment buildings off-limits. Some states require registered offenders to submit to regular polygraph tests and random police inspections. Florida adds \u201csexual predator\u201d to the front of registrants\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses. Louisiana doesn\u2019t allow sex offenders to evacuate from their own homes before natural disasters.\nWhat explains these relentlessly tightening restrictions, Levenson said, is the domino effect that happens every time a city or state strengthens their registration laws. Politicians in neighboring jurisdictions, fearing an influx of offenders, feel they have no choice but to tighten their own. In April, Tennessee passed a new law restricting sex offenders from being alone with their own children, a direct response to a similar provision in Alabama.\nDespite child sexual abuse declining <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 60% between</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1992 and</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010,</span> states continue to legislate as if lenient sex offender laws are a national emergency. And, like so many other corners of the criminal justice system, the crackdown hasn\u2019t affected all Americans equally. State registries are disproportionately black and overwhelmingly poor. As demonstrated by the recent case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire long accused of molesting underage girls, local prosecutors and judges have wide discretion to overlook wealthy offenders while imposing impossible restrictions on poorer ones.\nSex offender registries continue to enjoy enthusiastic bipartisan support and meager media scrutiny despite any evidence that they achieve their stated goals.\n\u201cThese laws are passed with good intentions,\u201d Levenson said, \u201cbut they\u2019re based on myths about sex offenses and they don\u2019t keep people from reoffending. Community safety is important, but we need evidence-based policies that allow offenders to reintegrate into society. All we\u2019re doing now is putting people in a position where they have nothing to lose.\u201d\nSex offender registries are based on faulty assumptions and debunked myths.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">While the criteria for sex offender registries vary widely between states, they are all based on the same two false assumptions: that sex offenders are uniquely likely to reoffend, and that notifying their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status will make that outcome less likely.\n</span>The first assumption is based on the \u201cstranger danger\u201d myth \u2014 that serial predators commit most offenses against children. In reality, strangers carry out <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 7% of</span> these crimes. Statistically speaking, the greatest risks to children are their parents, other children and authority figures they know and trust.\nResearchers consistently find that sex offenders are in fact less likely to reoffend than other criminals. A study of <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 1,800 sex</span> offenders across four states found that <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 10% reoffended</span> in the decade after their release from prison \u2014 far lower than <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 83% recidivism</span> rate for parolees convicted of other crimes.\nNot only are registered sex offenders relatively unlikely to reoffend, but the registries themselves appear to have no effect whatsoever on recidivism rates. Numerous studies have found that enacting sex offender registries doesn\u2019t reduce the rate of sex crimes and that states don\u2019t see a drop in the number of abuse victims after enacting harsher requirements.\nOne of the most common restrictions on registered sex offenders is the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d preventing them from living or working near schools, parks or playgrounds. While these restrictions may seem like an obvious safety measure, they too appear to have no effect on abuse or recidivism rates. An analysis <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 224 crimes</span> committed by known offenders in Minnesota found that residential restrictions would not have prevented even one. Another study in New Jersey found that <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 4.4% of</span> offenders met their victims in the types of public, children-oriented spaces the registry restricts.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any empirical relationship between where somebody lives and their likelihood of abusing a child,\u201d Levenson said. Offenders will encounter children nearly everywhere, from grocery stores to city buses. The widest city and state buffer zones <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 2,500 feet</span>, or roughly a 15-minute walk. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">These measures, Levenson said, do little to protect children, but a lot to keep offenders from finding homes and jobs.\n</span>If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that. If they\u2019re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences.

The rest suffer from a combination of mental illness or disability, other sexual disorders or disinhibitions due to drug or alcohol abuse.\nAlbertson appears to match this pattern. He said he\u2019s never been attracted to minors. Molesting his daughter was an expression of emotional instability and his own history of sexual abuse, he said.\nNone of this excuses Albertson\u2019s crime, of course. But registry systems rarely take into account the complexities of sexual abuse or incorporate evidence on the factors that will reduce reoffending. Even when they do split registrants into high-, medium- and low-risk categories, they typically base these assessments on their crime alone. This leaves out critical information about the circumstances of their crime and the factors that could lead them to commit another.\nFor registrants who aren\u2019t attracted to children, restrictions like buffer zones around schools and postcards to their neighbors amount to disproportionate punishment. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">For registrants who are attracted to children, the high risk of homelessness, social ostracism and unemployment associated with their registration status may be pushing them in the wrong direction.\n</span>\u201cIf someone has an attraction to children, they need energy to control and manage those feelings,\u201d Seto said. \u201cIf you take away their social support and if they don\u2019t have something to do with their time, you diminish their ability to manage their urges and increase the likelihood that they\u2019ll drink or use drugs. That\u2019s a much greater risk factor than living close to a school.\u201d\nPoliticians are still unwilling to roll back sex offender registration laws.\nThe ineffectiveness of sex offender registries has been well-established for years, and yet lawmakers at every level are reluctant to roll them back.\nBrandon Buskey, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Smart Justice Project, said he\u2019s not aware of a single jurisdiction that has voted to loosen its registry requirements voluntarily. <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> National Affairs noted that no enhancement of sex offender registry laws had ever failed a floor vote in a state legislature. Many pass unanimously and few earn any critical media coverage.\n\u201cThe logic is that if they save even one life, then they\u2019re worth it,\u201d Buskey said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sentiment that is keeping them alive: You can\u2019t prove that they won\u2019t help someone, regardless of how many people we know they hurt.\u201d\nCourts, however, are beginning to find this argument unconvincing. <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> judges in California and Michigan declared those states\u2019 <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">longstanding 2,000</span>-foot buffer zones around schools unconstitutional. <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina\u2019s law banning sex offenders from using social media violated the First Amendment. The same year, a Colorado judge ruled that the \u201cpublic shaming and banishment\u201d caused by public notification amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The provision now applies only to violent offenders.\nBut the process of overturning registry restrictions is achingly slow and confoundingly specific. Earlier this year, Georgia struck down lifetime electronic monitoring for sex offenders but deemed it acceptable for criminals on probation. A number of states have ruled that registration is unconstitutional for juveniles and when applied retroactively \u2014 but acceptable in all other circumstances. An Iowa judge <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004 declared</span> that there was \u201cno evidence demonstrating that <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2,000</span>-foot \u2018buffer zone\u2019 actually protects children,\u201d but his decision was later overruled by the State Supreme Court.\nSeto said one of the reasons for the ongoing push-and-pull over sex offender registries is that American institutions still haven\u2019t decided what purpose they are intended to serve. When they were first devised, registries were primarily a tool for law enforcement. By now, they have become a form of retribution, a reminder for offenders and their communities that they are nothing more than their worst moment.\n\u201cIf registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that,\u201d Seto said. \u201cIf they\u2019re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences.\u201d\nA real solution to child sexual abuse, Seto said, would be humane, individualized and comprehensive. It would include more widely available mental health treatment for offenders after their crimes and the rest of the population to prevent them from happening in the first place. It would also involve educating parents about where the real risks lie, informing children about boundaries and consent and reforming law enforcement agencies to encourage victims to report \u2014 and take them seriously when they do.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">And while registries do have a role to play in reducing child sexual abuse \u2014most researchers acknowledge that some offenders should not be allowed to work with children, for example \u2014 this goal could be achieved with targeted databases that that function more like background checks for employers and law enforcement.\n</span>All of these steps would finally align America\u2019s solution to sex abuse with the reality of the problem.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always worrying about the creepy stranger at the playground,\u201d Seto said, \u201cbut if we want to solve this problem, we have to improve safety at home.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Sex Offender Registries Don't Keep Kids Safe, But Politicians Keep Expanding Them Anyway</h3>The first time Damian Winters got evicted was <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span></span> He was living with his wife and two sons in suburban Nashville when his probation officer called his landlord and informed him that Winters was a registered sex offender.\nThe previous year, when he <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 24 years</span> old, Winters had been arrested for downloading a three-minute porn clip. The file description said the girl in the video was 16; the prosecutor said she <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 14.</span> He was charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a minor and, because he had used file-sharing software to download the video, attempted distribution of child pornography.\nWinters had no criminal record, no history of contact with children and no other illegal files on his computer. Facing an eight-year prison sentence, he had taken a plea deal that gave him six years\u2019 probation <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 15 years</span> on Tennessee\u2019s sex offender registry.\nThe day after his landlord found all this out, Winters found a letter on his porch giving him and his <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">family 72 hours</span> to move out. He ended up in one homeless shelter, his wife and sons in another.\nHe had no idea that it would be the last time he would ever live in a home. He has been sleeping in shelters, halfway houses and parked cars ever since.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019ve lost everything so many times,\u201d said Winters, who asked HuffPost not to use his real name due to concerns that it would add to the difficulty of finding housing and employment.\n</span>His years on the registry have been an exercise in hitting rock bottom and then falling even further down. He has attempted suicide twice and checked himself into inpatient psychiatric facilities three times. The strain of living apart from his family eventually ended his marriage. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Without an income to help keep his family afloat, his now-ex-wife had no choice but to take the kids and move back in with her parents in Ohio.</span> Winters can\u2019t visit without approval from his probation officer and can\u2019t afford the bus fare very often anyway, so he only sees his sons a few times per year. <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">At 29,</span> he still <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">h<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 10 years</span></span> left before his name comes off the registry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even forge relationships anymore,\u201d Winters said. \u201cPeople are judgmental, so I keep to myself. I go to work, I go to sleep and I try not to think about what\u2019s going to take everything away the next time.\u201d\nWinters is a member of an expanding and invisible American underclass. <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1994,</span> when Congress passed the first sex offender registration law, the list was reserved for law enforcement officials and only applied to the most serious offenders. Since then, American lawmakers at every level have relentlessly increased its scope and severity.\nThe registry now includes more <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 900,000 people</span>, a population slightly greater than Vermont\u2019s. At <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 states</span> require sex offender registration for public urination; five apply it to people charged with offenses related to sex work;<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 29 require</span> it for consensual sex between teenagers. According to Human Rights Watch, people have been forced to spend decades on the registry for crimes they committed as young <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 10 years</span> old.\n\u201cWhen we first started talking about registering sex offenders it seemed like a good idea,\u201d said Jill Levenson, a Barry University researcher and social worker who has published more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 articles</span> about sexual abuse. \u201cBut now the net has widened. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They\u2019re for life, there\u2019s no mechanism to come off and there\u2019s more restrictions on employment, housing and travel.\u201d\n</span>The conditions imposed on registered sex offenders have become significantly more draconian over time. More <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 states</span> now require registrants to live at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 1,000 feet</span> away from schools, churches and other places children congregate \u2014 a requirement that renders up <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 99% of</span> homes and apartment buildings off-limits. Some states require registered offenders to submit to regular polygraph tests and random police inspections. Florida adds \u201csexual predator\u201d to the front of registrants\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses. Louisiana doesn\u2019t allow sex offenders to evacuate from their own homes before natural disasters.\nWhat explains these relentlessly tightening restrictions, Levenson said, is the domino effect that happens every time a city or state strengthens their registration laws. Politicians in neighboring jurisdictions, fearing an influx of offenders, feel they have no choice but to tighten their own. In April, Tennessee passed a new law restricting sex offenders from being alone with their own children, a direct response to a similar provision in Alabama.\nDespite child sexual abuse declining <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 60% between</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1992 and</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010,</span> states continue to legislate as if lenient sex offender laws are a national emergency. And, like so many other corners of the criminal justice system, the crackdown hasn\u2019t affected all Americans equally. State registries are disproportionately black and overwhelmingly poor. As demonstrated by the recent case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire long accused of molesting underage girls, local prosecutors and judges have wide discretion to overlook wealthy offenders while imposing impossible restrictions on poorer ones.\nSex offender registries continue to enjoy enthusiastic bipartisan support and meager media scrutiny despite any evidence that they achieve their stated goals.\n\u201cThese laws are passed with good intentions,\u201d Levenson said, \u201cbut they\u2019re based on myths about sex offenses and they don\u2019t keep people from reoffending. Community safety is important, but we need evidence-based policies that allow offenders to reintegrate into society. All we\u2019re doing now is putting people in a position where they have nothing to lose.\u201d\nSex offender registries are based on faulty assumptions and debunked myths.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">While the criteria for sex offender registries vary widely between states, they are all based on the same two false assumptions: that sex offenders are uniquely likely to reoffend, and that notifying their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status will make that outcome less likely.\n</span>The first assumption is based on the \u201cstranger danger\u201d myth \u2014 that serial predators commit most offenses against children. In reality, strangers carry out <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 7% of</span> these crimes. Statistically speaking, the greatest risks to children are their parents, other children and authority figures they know and trust.\nResearchers consistently find that sex offenders are in fact less likely to reoffend than other criminals. A study of <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 1,800 sex</span> offenders across four states found that <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 10% reoffended</span> in the decade after their release from prison \u2014 far lower than <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 83% recidivism</span> rate for parolees convicted of other crimes.\nNot only are registered sex offenders relatively unlikely to reoffend, but the registries themselves appear to have no effect whatsoever on recidivism rates. Numerous studies have found that enacting sex offender registries doesn\u2019t reduce the rate of sex crimes and that states don\u2019t see a drop in the number of abuse victims after enacting harsher requirements.\nOne of the most common restrictions on registered sex offenders is the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d preventing them from living or working near schools, parks or playgrounds. While these restrictions may seem like an obvious safety measure, they too appear to have no effect on abuse or recidivism rates. An analysis <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 224 crimes</span> committed by known offenders in Minnesota found that residential restrictions would not have prevented even one. Another study in New Jersey found that <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 4.4% of</span> offenders met their victims in the types of public, children-oriented spaces the registry restricts.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any empirical relationship between where somebody lives and their likelihood of abusing a child,\u201d Levenson said. Offenders will encounter children nearly everywhere, from grocery stores to city buses. The widest city and state buffer zones <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 2,500 feet</span>, or roughly a 15-minute walk. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">These measures, Levenson said, do little to protect children, but a lot to keep offenders from finding homes and jobs.\n</span>If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that. If they\u2019re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences. Michael Seto, forensic research director at The Royal Ottawa Health Care Group\nAnother common element of sex offender registries is public notification. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Every state requires offenders to notify their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status.</span> Some send out postcards to every resident within a two-block radius.

That\u2019s a much greater risk factor than living close to a school.\u201d\nPoliticians are still unwilling to roll back sex offender registration laws.\nThe ineffectiveness of sex offender registries has been well-established for years, and yet lawmakers at every level are reluctant to roll them back.\nBrandon Buskey, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Smart Justice Project, said he\u2019s not aware of a single jurisdiction that has voted to loosen its registry requirements voluntarily. <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> National Affairs noted that no enhancement of sex offender registry laws had ever failed a floor vote in a state legislature. Many pass unanimously and few earn any critical media coverage.\n\u201cThe logic is that if they save even one life, then they\u2019re worth it,\u201d Buskey said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sentiment that is keeping them alive: You can\u2019t prove that they won\u2019t help someone, regardless of how many people we know they hurt.\u201d\nCourts, however, are beginning to find this argument unconvincing. <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> judges in California and Michigan declared those states\u2019 <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">longstanding 2,000</span>-foot buffer zones around schools unconstitutional. <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina\u2019s law banning sex offenders from using social media violated the First Amendment. The same year, a Colorado judge ruled that the \u201cpublic shaming and banishment\u201d caused by public notification amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The provision now applies only to violent offenders.\nBut the process of overturning registry restrictions is achingly slow and confoundingly specific. Earlier this year, Georgia struck down lifetime electronic monitoring for sex offenders but deemed it acceptable for criminals on probation. A number of states have ruled that registration is unconstitutional for juveniles and when applied retroactively \u2014 but acceptable in all other circumstances. An Iowa judge <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004 declared</span> that there was \u201cno evidence demonstrating that <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2,000</span>-foot \u2018buffer zone\u2019 actually protects children,\u201d but his decision was later overruled by the State Supreme Court.\nSeto said one of the reasons for the ongoing push-and-pull over sex offender registries is that American institutions still haven\u2019t decided what purpose they are intended to serve. When they were first devised, registries were primarily a tool for law enforcement. By now, they have become a form of retribution, a reminder for offenders and their communities that they are nothing more than their worst moment.\n\u201cIf registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that,\u201d Seto said. \u201cIf they\u2019re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences.\u201d\nA real solution to child sexual abuse, Seto said, would be humane, individualized and comprehensive. It would include more widely available mental health treatment for offenders after their crimes and the rest of the population to prevent them from happening in the first place. It would also involve educating parents about where the real risks lie, informing children about boundaries and consent and reforming law enforcement agencies to encourage victims to report \u2014 and take them seriously when they do.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">And while registries do have a role to play in reducing child sexual abuse \u2014most researchers acknowledge that some offenders should not be allowed to work with children, for example \u2014 this goal could be achieved with targeted databases that that function more like background checks for employers and law enforcement.\n</span>All of these steps would finally align America\u2019s solution to sex abuse with the reality of the problem.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always worrying about the creepy stranger at the playground,\u201d Seto said, \u201cbut if we want to solve this problem, we have to improve safety at home.\u201d"}, "79651": {"id": "79651", "text": "<h3>Saudi Oil Attack Is the Big One</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday\u2019s attack will linger over the energy market\n\nUpdated Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 7</span>:28 am ET\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack on a critical Saudi oil facility will almost certainly rock the world energy market in the short term, but it also carries disturbing long-term implications.\n\n</span>Ever since the dual 1970s oil crises, energy security officials have fretted about a deliberate strike on one of the critical choke points of energy production and transport.

A clubhouse attendant appeared and told Nevin he had a visitor waiting in the hallway: Alex Cintron, the hitting coach of the Houston Astros.\nThis was alarming: During <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Game 1 the</span> day before, the Yankees had shouted angrily at the Astros because they heard whistling coming from the vicinity of the Houston dugout. (This was before the Astros admitted to, and were penalized for, cheating in previous seasons, but opponents had long been suspicious.)\nWhether the whistling was simply gamesmanship or something more nefarious, Nevin didn\u2019t like it, or how Cintron was behaving. So he had sent a threat to Cintron \u2014 something about meeting anyplace at any time to settle a score \u2014 via Astros third baseman Alex Bregman.\nBut when Nevin burst through the clubhouse doors, Cintron wasn\u2019t there. Instead, it was Yankees Manager Aaron Boone and General Manager Brian Cashman, who was the prank\u2019s mastermind, with cellphones out to capture it on video.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop laughing after that,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cWhen he walked out, he had his game face on.\u201d\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">For 23 years</span>, Cashman has held one of the most high-profile and demanding jobs in sports: the Yankees\u2019 general manager.</span> In that span \u2014 much of it under George Steinbrenner, the exacting and fiery owner who died <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 the Yankees have <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">won 2,131 regular</span>-season games, more than any other franchise in the major leagues; reached the <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">playoffs 19 times</span>, including this year; and claimed four World Series titles, the last coming <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009,</span> an eternity in the Bronx.\nCashman,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 53,</span> is also highly accomplished in another category: pranks. Many inside the Yankees\u2019 organization \u2014 from the principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, George\u2019s son, to the Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera \u2014 have stories about being on the receiving end of a Cashman practical joke.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best at it,\u201d said Jim Hendry, the Yankees\u2019 special assistant scout and a former Chicago Cubs general manager.\nReggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame outfielder who is now a Yankees special adviser, added, \u201cHe\u2019s always trying something.\u201d\nMaking personnel decisions for one of the most valuable pro sports franchises in the world can be stressful, and Cashman has used his pranks to defuse tension or produce a few smiles amid it all \u2014 especially during a <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">challenging 2020 season</span> complicated by the pandemic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something that feels like it could lighten the load,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cBottom line: Every day is a day of importance, so any day you can have fun while you\u2019re doing fun work. I just like to have fun.\u201d\nCashman\u2019s mischievous streak dates at least to college, he said. One of the earliest pranks he remembered pulling with the Yankees, with whom he started full time <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989,</span> came when he was an assistant general manager, a position he held <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1992 to</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1998.</span>\nFrom a blocked number, Cashman called one of his mentors and favorite targets, Gene Michael, the former Yankees general manager and manager whose work had laid the foundation for four World Series teams. The Florida Marlins had a managerial opening, so Cashman, disguising his voice and posing as a Miami Herald reporter, told Michael \u2014 a scout for the Yankees at the time \u2014 that he was on a shortlist for the position.\n\u201cOh man, it was like hook, line and sinker,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cHe goes: \u2018I certainly can\u2019t comment on that. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But off the record, of course I would have interest.\u2019</span> I started laughing, and he was like: \u2018Who is this? Who is this?\u2019 I told him. I was crying because I was laughing so hard.\u201d\nCashman couldn\u2019t recall exactly why he had targeted Michael \u2014 probably revenge for a joke Michael had at his expense, he said. Cashman, after all, has pulled so many pranks over the years he can\u2019t remember every one.\n\u201cThe more august he has gone into his general managership, he doesn\u2019t do those nasty, vicious ones,\u201d said the Yankees assistant general manager Jean Afterman, who added that Cashman has joked with her but \u201cwould never dare\u201d prank her, because she could easily get him back.\nAfterman, though, has helped Cashman with some of his mischief. Cashman had once been using a cheap machine that produced fake flatulence, and she bought him a higher-quality one she called \u201cthe <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fartmaster 4000.</span>\u201d (Cashman has burned through many of those.) He hid the device in the visiting players\u2019 lounge at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2009 World</span> Series and watched from an adjacent room.\n\u201cIn a moment when he felt that everybody was serious, he had the remote in his hand and pushed the button,\u201d said Billy Eppler, a former Yankees assistant general manager who was most recently the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 general manager.\nDuring <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2005 winter</span> meetings, an annual baseball convention, Cashman deployed both a flatulence machine and a little trickery on reporters who were interviewing him in a hotel suite. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Cashman intentionally left a piece of paper on a coffee table with a fictional trade proposal with the Milwaukee Brewers that said something along the lines of: \u201cWe get Ben Sheets.</span> They get Robinson Cano and Chien-Ming Wang.\u201d\nThinking he had a scoop, Mark Feinsand, who covered the Yankees for MLB.com, placed his notebook on the paper and planned to discreetly follow up with Cashman afterward. \u201cI had to do the big reveal because I didn\u2019t want him to write a false story,\u201d Cashman said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Cashman has used the fake trade bit on his employees, too.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He once changed the contact information in his cellphone for a rival general manager so that he could trick Matt Ferry, the Yankees\u2019 director of baseball operations, into thinking he had completed a trade that Ferry opposed.</span> In reality, Cashman was simply texting himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just naturally part of his personality,\u201d Eppler said. \u201cHe just has a really good understanding of tone and timing. He knows there\u2019s times to be serious and times we can laugh a little bit. He understands that\u2019s a good medicine.\u201d\nPlanning for the annual draft can be one of the more stressful tasks for the Yankees\u2019 front office, said Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees\u2019 vice president for domestic amateur scouting. But when Cashman arrives every year to the team\u2019s facility in Tampa, Fla., Oppenheimer said, he can put people at ease with his laid-back attire (flip flops, T-shirt and shorts) and his humor.\nAround the time of one draft, Oppenheimer said, Cashman used the flatulence machine on him while they were ordering dinner at a restaurant.\n\u201cYou have to tell the waitress because she\u2019s not going to say anything,\u201d Oppenheimer said, laughing, \u201cbut you\u2019re like, \u2018This is what we deal with.\u2019\u201d\nCashman said he was fair game for pranks, too. Afterman said she once pranked Cashman years ago with a fake waiver claim for a player who was owed a lot of money.\nPhillies Manager Joe Girardi, who was the Yankees\u2019 manager <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2008 to</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> said he \u201calways\u201d got Cashman back but only vaguely elaborated. \u201cSome of the same things he did to me,\u201d Girardi said.\nPranks have been harder to pull off this season with so many front office staffers working remotely, Cashman said. But recently, when Matt Daley, a director of pro scouting, who lives in New Jersey, went to Yankee Stadium for a meeting held mostly on Zoom to go over the team\u2019s potential playoff opponents, Cashman had a rare in-person target.\nSo Cashman said he sneaked out of his office and tossed party snaps \u2014 the type that make firecracker-like sounds \u2014 into the conference room where Daley was sitting during the video call.\nEppler said he had also been the target of party snap blitzes during presentations, as well as a clicker pen that shocks users. Cashman occasionally gave it to him when he was signing official documents.\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably forgotten half the stuff I\u2019ve pulled,\u201d Cashman said.\nHe did remember, though, a few he had inflicted on players. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">He was the architect behind the drafting of a prank letter from the Internal Revenue Service to Rivera <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> the final season of the pitcher\u2019s 19-year career, about a payment owed on behalf of his charity.\n</span>\u201cHe was so nervous because the number was so astronomical,\u201d Cashman said.\nCashman said he once gave the former outfielder Nick Swisher a prank scratch lottery ticket that produced <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $50,000 winner</span>. (He told Swisher he had picked it up at a gas station on the way to Yankee Stadium that day.) Swisher, in the middle of <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $27 million</span> contract, raced up and down the hallways in delight at his apparent good fortune.\nThe instructions on the back read: \u201cClaim forms supplied by Santa Claus. All winning tickets must be validated by the Tooth Fairy and conform to her game rules.\u201d (Cashman keeps these and the party snaps in his office desk.)\nAs he told his side of Cashman\u2019s prank at the Astros\u2019 ballpark, Nevin insisted he wasn\u2019t looking for a fight with Cintron when he charged through the clubhouse doors last October. He said he expected to have a discussion, \u201cnot to knock each other out.\u201d\nHe still laughs about the practical joke and hinted that he might get Cashman back one day.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe does a good job of mixing the professionalism with having fun with the guys, staff and players,\u201d Nevin said.</span> \u201cIt makes us all better.

Yet he probably knows <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $100 bill</span> better than most Americans.\nHe says he can pick out a counterfeit by touch. He can tell you exactly <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what $100,000 looks</span> like. (Ten half-inch stacks, small enough to hold in one hand.) And on numerous occasions, he has walked down the streets of Buenos Aires with tens of thousands of U.S. dollars tucked into his jacket.\nThat is because Mr. Rabuffetti, a property developer who has built two office towers and a house here, bought the land for each of those buildings <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in $100 bills</span>.\n\u201cHere, if you don\u2019t actually see the money, nobody signs anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the number of crises we\u2019ve been through, let\u2019s just say you get used to it.\u201d\nIt is not just Mr. Rabuffetti. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Nearly every big purchase in Argentina \u2014 land, houses, cars, expensive art \u2014 is done in tall stacks of U.S. currency.</span> To save up, Argentines stuff bundles of American bills into old clothes, beneath floor boards and in bombproof safe deposit boxes past nine locked gates and five stories beneath the ground.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Argentines hold so much U.S. currency \u2014 experts believe perhaps more than anywhere outside the United States \u2014 sometimes it gets thrown away by mistake.</span> Last month, passers-by found tens of thousands of dollars blowing around at an Argentine dump.\nThe dollar is king in Argentina because the Argentine peso is disintegrating in value, particularly over the past month. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">One year ago, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 180 pesos</span> could <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy $1 on</span> the widely used black market.</span> Now it <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">takes 298 pesos</span> to buy a buck. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">With the peso plummeting, prices are soaring to keep up.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Many economists expect inflation here, already <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 64 percent</span> this year, to <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hit 90 percent</span> by December.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">It is one of the country\u2019s worst economic crises in decades, and that is saying something for Argentina.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">As countries across the world try to cope with rising prices, there is perhaps no major economy that understands how to live with inflation better than Argentina.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The country has struggled with rapidly rising prices for much of the <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 50 years</span>.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">During a chaotic stretch in the late 1980s, inflation hit a nearly <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">unbelievable 3,000 percent</span> and residents rushed to snatch up groceries before clerks with price guns could make their rounds.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Now high inflation is back, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 30 percent</span> every year <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2018.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">To understand how Argentines cope, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurateurs, realtors, barbers, taxi drivers, money changers, street performers, street vendors and the unemployed.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The economy is not always the best conversation starter, but in Argentina, it animated just about everyone, eliciting curses, deep sighs and informed opinions about monetary policy.</span> One woman happily showed off her hiding spot for a wad of U.S. dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed cash into her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress wondered whether she had immigrated to the right country.\nOne thing became strikingly clear: Argentines have developed a highly unusual relationship with their money.\nThey spend their pesos as quickly as they get them. They buy everything from TVs to potato peelers in installments. They don\u2019t trust banks. They hardly use credit. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">And after years of constant price hikes, they are left with little idea of how much things should cost.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Argentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to fathom almost anywhere else in the world.</span> Life is especially manageable for those with the means to make the upside-down system work. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But all those striking workarounds mean that few who have held political power during years of economic distress have found themselves paying a real price.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe ask ourselves the same thing: How is society allowing these things to happen?\u201d said Juan Piantoni, the head of Ingot, a safe-deposit-box company where business is booming as Argentines pay to stash their cash.</span> \u201cAt this moment, I think we\u2019re on the eve of a situation that could lead to a major crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one has lit the fuse yet. But the day that happens, we\u2019ll see what we\u2019re up against.\u201d\nSo far, things have remained largely calm. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Wages for many jobs are rising at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 percent</span> a year.</span> Landlords can raise rents at similar rates. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">And millions of Argentines use the black market to evade government restrictions on buying U.S. dollars.\n</span>The result is that in the wealthier areas of Argentina\u2019s capital, construction continues apace and restaurants and bars are packed. The next dinner reservation for two at Anchoita, one of the city\u2019s hippest restaurants, is in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2023.</span>\nIn poorer neighborhoods, people collect scrap cardboard to sell, pool their money for food and swap used goods to avoid the peso altogether. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Argentina\u2019s poor typically don\u2019t have jobs with automatic wage increases, and they certainly don\u2019t have extra cash to buy U.S. dollars.</span> That means they are left making few pesos while everything around them gets much, much more expensive. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 37 percent</span> of Argentines now live in poverty, up <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 30 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span>\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">8 Signs That the Economy Is Losing Steam\nWorrying outlook.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Amid persistently high inflation, rising consumer prices and declining spending, the American economy is showing clear signs of slowing down, fueling concerns about a potential recession.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Here are other eight measures signaling trouble ahead:\nOn <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2,</span> Argentina\u2019s economic minister resigned.</span> Over the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">next 26 days</span>, the peso\u2019s value <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped 26 percent</span>. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Then President Alberto Fernandez fired the new economic minister.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It was the 21st time that an Argentine economic minister lasted two months or less.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Argentina\u2019s recent bout with hyperinflation is linked to the same things that have driven up prices worldwide, including the war in Ukraine, supply-chain constraints and big increases in public spending.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">But many economists believe Argentina\u2019s inflation is also self-inflicted.</span> In short, the country spends far more than it takes in to fund free or deeply subsidized health care, universities, energy and public transportation. To make up for the shortfall, it prints more pesos.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund, which is <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owed $44 billion</span> from Argentina, has asked the government to cut its deficit and pass stricter monetary policies.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">On Wednesday, the new minister, Sergio Massa, made one of the most significant steps in years when he pledged that Argentina would stop printing pesos to fund its budget.\n</span>Yet many Argentines were skeptical that the country was ready to make the tough choices necessary.\n\u201cWe might need the patient to have a heart attack before the family says, \u2018Let\u2019s do the surgery,\u2019\u201d said Hugo Alconada Mon, one of the country\u2019s top investigative journalists and a best-selling author who spent almost the last of his savings recently on car repairs. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut how many people will end up in poverty because of that?</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">How many people will leave the country?\u201d\nAbandoning price tags\nArgentines are hoping the current moment does not spiral into a disaster <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 2001,</span> when there was a run on the banks.\n</span>That year, it became clear that foreign investors believed the Argentine peso was worth far less than the government\u2019s official rate, and Argentines rushed to get their money before it was lost. Instead, the government halted withdrawals \u2014 and then gave them all a haircut, reducing everyone\u2019s savings in a sudden devaluation. The president resigned and left the government offices in a helicopter to avoid the angry crowds in the regal square out front, Plaza de Mayo.\nTwo decades later, the angry crowds are still in Plaza de Mayo. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Thousands of Argentines gathered there last month to protest the soaring inflation.\n</span>Ana Mabel was on the outskirts of the crowd, mixing peanuts and caramelized sugar in a metal vat. She was selling bags of candied peanuts <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 200 pesos</span> each, or <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 70 cents</span>; she had <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">charged 150 pesos</span> a week earlier. But that increase hardly kept up with her costs. Everything she needed had gotten pricier in just the past few weeks: the peanuts, the sugar, the oil, the gas tank, and the plastic baggies to package the treat. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">She has five children to support, and for the first time, she had taken on debt.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">\u201cNothing regulates the prices,\u201d she said, frustrated, slowly turning the peanuts in the vat.</span> \u201cThe businessmen don\u2019t want it. The government can\u2019t. And that all falls on us.\u201d\nFor Argentines, it is an old story. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> prices had risen so much that Argentina doubled the size of its largest bank note <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1,000 pesos</span>, then worth <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $58 on</span> the black market.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Now that note is worth <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3.45 </span>\u2014 about the price of a Big Mac.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">An iPhone can now cost more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 million</span> pesos.\n</span>Many Argentines have lost their bearings on value. Menus are constantly changed. Taxi meters are frequently adjusted. <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">And price tags are often outdated.\n</span>Oscar Benitez runs a meticulously organized hardware store the size of a large walk-in closet. <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">He <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sells 80,000 different</span> products, and he hardly knows the price of any of them.\n</span>That is because they change every few days, updated in a running list sent by his suppliers that he checks on his computer for every sale. <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">He has largely abandoned price tags.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">He shows a pair of scissors that the supplier says should now <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">cost 600 pesos</span>.</span> \u201cA month ago, it was <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth 400 pesos</span>,\u201d he said, consulting his list. \u201cA year ago, it was <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth 120 pesos</span>.\u201d\nHe looked exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.

He can tell you exactly <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what $100,000 looks</span> like. (Ten half-inch stacks, small enough to hold in one hand.) And on numerous occasions, he has walked down the streets of Buenos Aires with tens of thousands of U.S. dollars tucked into his jacket.\nThat is because Mr. Rabuffetti, a property developer who has built two office towers and a house here, bought the land for each of those buildings <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in $100 bills</span>.\n\u201cHere, if you don\u2019t actually see the money, nobody signs anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the number of crises we\u2019ve been through, let\u2019s just say you get used to it.\u201d\nIt is not just Mr. Rabuffetti. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Nearly every big purchase in Argentina \u2014 land, houses, cars, expensive art \u2014 is done in tall stacks of U.S. currency.</span> To save up, Argentines stuff bundles of American bills into old clothes, beneath floor boards and in bombproof safe deposit boxes past nine locked gates and five stories beneath the ground.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Argentines hold so much U.S. currency \u2014 experts believe perhaps more than anywhere outside the United States \u2014 sometimes it gets thrown away by mistake.</span> Last month, passers-by found tens of thousands of dollars blowing around at an Argentine dump.\nThe dollar is king in Argentina because the Argentine peso is disintegrating in value, particularly over the past month. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">One year ago, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 180 pesos</span> could <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy $1 on</span> the widely used black market.</span> Now it <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">takes 298 pesos</span> to buy a buck. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">With the peso plummeting, prices are soaring to keep up.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Many economists expect inflation here, already <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 64 percent</span> this year, to <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hit 90 percent</span> by December.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">It is one of the country\u2019s worst economic crises in decades, and that is saying something for Argentina.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">As countries across the world try to cope with rising prices, there is perhaps no major economy that understands how to live with inflation better than Argentina.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The country has struggled with rapidly rising prices for much of the <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 50 years</span>.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">During a chaotic stretch in the late 1980s, inflation hit a nearly <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">unbelievable 3,000 percent</span> and residents rushed to snatch up groceries before clerks with price guns could make their rounds.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Now high inflation is back, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 30 percent</span> every year <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2018.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">To understand how Argentines cope, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurateurs, realtors, barbers, taxi drivers, money changers, street performers, street vendors and the unemployed.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The economy is not always the best conversation starter, but in Argentina, it animated just about everyone, eliciting curses, deep sighs and informed opinions about monetary policy.</span> One woman happily showed off her hiding spot for a wad of U.S. dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed cash into her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress wondered whether she had immigrated to the right country.\nOne thing became strikingly clear: Argentines have developed a highly unusual relationship with their money.\nThey spend their pesos as quickly as they get them. They buy everything from TVs to potato peelers in installments. They don\u2019t trust banks. They hardly use credit. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">And after years of constant price hikes, they are left with little idea of how much things should cost.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Argentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to fathom almost anywhere else in the world.</span> Life is especially manageable for those with the means to make the upside-down system work. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But all those striking workarounds mean that few who have held political power during years of economic distress have found themselves paying a real price.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe ask ourselves the same thing: How is society allowing these things to happen?\u201d said Juan Piantoni, the head of Ingot, a safe-deposit-box company where business is booming as Argentines pay to stash their cash.</span> \u201cAt this moment, I think we\u2019re on the eve of a situation that could lead to a major crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one has lit the fuse yet. But the day that happens, we\u2019ll see what we\u2019re up against.\u201d\nSo far, things have remained largely calm. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Wages for many jobs are rising at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 percent</span> a year.</span> Landlords can raise rents at similar rates. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">And millions of Argentines use the black market to evade government restrictions on buying U.S. dollars.\n</span>The result is that in the wealthier areas of Argentina\u2019s capital, construction continues apace and restaurants and bars are packed. The next dinner reservation for two at Anchoita, one of the city\u2019s hippest restaurants, is in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2023.</span>\nIn poorer neighborhoods, people collect scrap cardboard to sell, pool their money for food and swap used goods to avoid the peso altogether. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Argentina\u2019s poor typically don\u2019t have jobs with automatic wage increases, and they certainly don\u2019t have extra cash to buy U.S. dollars.</span> That means they are left making few pesos while everything around them gets much, much more expensive. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 37 percent</span> of Argentines now live in poverty, up <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 30 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span>\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">8 Signs That the Economy Is Losing Steam\nWorrying outlook.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Amid persistently high inflation, rising consumer prices and declining spending, the American economy is showing clear signs of slowing down, fueling concerns about a potential recession.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Here are other eight measures signaling trouble ahead:\nOn <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2,</span> Argentina\u2019s economic minister resigned.</span> Over the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">next 26 days</span>, the peso\u2019s value <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped 26 percent</span>. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Then President Alberto Fernandez fired the new economic minister.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It was the 21st time that an Argentine economic minister lasted two months or less.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Argentina\u2019s recent bout with hyperinflation is linked to the same things that have driven up prices worldwide, including the war in Ukraine, supply-chain constraints and big increases in public spending.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">But many economists believe Argentina\u2019s inflation is also self-inflicted.</span> In short, the country spends far more than it takes in to fund free or deeply subsidized health care, universities, energy and public transportation. To make up for the shortfall, it prints more pesos.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund, which is <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owed $44 billion</span> from Argentina, has asked the government to cut its deficit and pass stricter monetary policies.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">On Wednesday, the new minister, Sergio Massa, made one of the most significant steps in years when he pledged that Argentina would stop printing pesos to fund its budget.\n</span>Yet many Argentines were skeptical that the country was ready to make the tough choices necessary.\n\u201cWe might need the patient to have a heart attack before the family says, \u2018Let\u2019s do the surgery,\u2019\u201d said Hugo Alconada Mon, one of the country\u2019s top investigative journalists and a best-selling author who spent almost the last of his savings recently on car repairs. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut how many people will end up in poverty because of that?</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">How many people will leave the country?\u201d\nAbandoning price tags\nArgentines are hoping the current moment does not spiral into a disaster <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 2001,</span> when there was a run on the banks.\n</span>That year, it became clear that foreign investors believed the Argentine peso was worth far less than the government\u2019s official rate, and Argentines rushed to get their money before it was lost. Instead, the government halted withdrawals \u2014 and then gave them all a haircut, reducing everyone\u2019s savings in a sudden devaluation. The president resigned and left the government offices in a helicopter to avoid the angry crowds in the regal square out front, Plaza de Mayo.\nTwo decades later, the angry crowds are still in Plaza de Mayo. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Thousands of Argentines gathered there last month to protest the soaring inflation.\n</span>Ana Mabel was on the outskirts of the crowd, mixing peanuts and caramelized sugar in a metal vat. She was selling bags of candied peanuts <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 200 pesos</span> each, or <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 70 cents</span>; she had <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">charged 150 pesos</span> a week earlier. But that increase hardly kept up with her costs. Everything she needed had gotten pricier in just the past few weeks: the peanuts, the sugar, the oil, the gas tank, and the plastic baggies to package the treat. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">She has five children to support, and for the first time, she had taken on debt.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">\u201cNothing regulates the prices,\u201d she said, frustrated, slowly turning the peanuts in the vat.</span> \u201cThe businessmen don\u2019t want it. The government can\u2019t. And that all falls on us.\u201d\nFor Argentines, it is an old story. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span> prices had risen so much that Argentina doubled the size of its largest bank note <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1,000 pesos</span>, then worth <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $58 on</span> the black market.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Now that note is worth <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3.45 </span>\u2014 about the price of a Big Mac.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">An iPhone can now cost more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 million</span> pesos.\n</span>Many Argentines have lost their bearings on value.

Then Scott Boras made a call.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">It had become a ritual for the Strasburgs of San Diego, an annual opportunity for a young family to sort out business, to assess the past year and look toward the future.</span> Stephen and Rachel, parents to 2-year-old Raegan, would meet for dinner at King\u2019s Fish House with his agent, Scott Boras, in mid-February, before heading to Viera, Fla., and spring training with the Washington Nationals.\nBoras and Scott Chiamparino, a top lieutenant, had driven from his Newport Beach offices. They chose King\u2019s for mutual convenience \u2014 a 10-minute drive from the Strasburgs\u2019 north San Diego offseason home, just off <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 405 for</span> Boras \u2014 and the food. They devoured plates of popcorn shrimp, crab Louie salad, clam chowder, fried fish and, for the health-conscious Strasburg, grilled salmon. Typically, they would use the meeting to discuss the specifics of Strasburg\u2019s arbitration deal. This time, both Boras and Strasburg entered the meal with grander ideas.\nBoras already had engaged in preliminary conversations with top Nationals officials, in both the front office and ownership, regarding signing Strasburg to a long-term contract extension. Strasburg, too, had spent the winter pondering the possibility, weighing his contentment in a city far away from the West Coast of his childhood that had slowly and unexpectedly come to feel like home. Free agency beckoned, but he felt the pull of comfort and familiarity. He wanted, he told Boras over fish and cocktail sauce, to stay in Washington.\nWhen Boras left King\u2019s, walking back to his car under the Southern California moonlight, he believed absolutely something no one else in the baseball world saw coming, even months later, until the news broke Monday night as Strasburg pitched at Nationals Park: Strasburg and the Nationals, he thought, would reach a long-term agreement to extend his contract. He phoned Ted Lerner, the Nationals\u2019 managing principal owner.\n\u201cI think we have an opportunity to put this thing together,\u201d Boras told him.\nThe following account, based on interviews with people directly and indirectly involved on both sides of the negotiations, describes how Strasburg, a former No.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 overall</span> pick as one of the most heralded young pitchers in a generation, and the Nationals agreed on a complex, seven-year extension <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $175 million</span></span>. The dealings offer a window into the often fruitful and uncommonly close relationship between Lerner and Boras, a show of Strasburg\u2019s affinity for Washington and a potential road map for future negotiations over a contract extension for Bryce Harper, Washington\u2019s other No.<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 pick</span> and franchise pillar represented by Boras.\nThe discussions started Jan.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15,</span> a busy day across baseball, the deadline to exchange contract figures for teams and players for salary arbitration. \u201cFrantic Friday, man,\u201d Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said. As Rizzo and Boras negotiated one-year deals for some of Boras\u2019s Nationals clients \u2014 Danny Espinosa, Anthony Rendon and Strasburg himself \u2014 Rizzo broached Strasburg\u2019s future.\nAlthough Strasburg, a natural introvert, had been slow to adjust to public life, Rizzo had seen subtle changes. In recent years, his interactions in Washington gave Rizzo a sense he had grown comfortable in the city. Even though Strasburg had just one season remaining before free agency, a stage at which almost all players choose to have <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 30 teams</span> bid on them, Rizzo believed Strasburg might be interested in a long-term deal.\nThe suggestion didn\u2019t surprise Boras. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The seed had been planted back in November, when Boras and Lerner met at the owners meetings in Boca Raton, Fla. Lerner, the 90-year-old Washington native who became one of America\u2019s wealthiest men through a real estate business he began with a loan from his wife, Annette, outlines his offseason vision at their annual discussion.</span> Boras, the 63-year-old former Class AA infielder who became one of baseball\u2019s most powerful figures, pitches Lerner on available clients.\n\u201cThey have an incredible relationship,\u201d said Mark Lerner, a Nationals principal owner and Ted\u2019s son. \u201cScott really respects my dad and what he\u2019s built over the years from nothing. They enjoy the banter back and forth. It\u2019s an interesting relationship. They know how to get things done.\u201d\n[How the Strasburg deal may affect Bryce Harper\u2019s future]\nBoras explained how Baltimore Orioles slugger Chris Davis would fit into Washington\u2019s lineup, hitting behind Harper. Lerner countered by saying he did not want an exorbitant contract like Davis\u2019s tying up long-term payroll that would hinder signing Strasburg or Harper, who is scheduled to become a free agent after <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 season</span>. Boras made a mental note about Lerner\u2019s desire to lock up Strasburg. Both men knew they would be in touch over the winter.\nOn the day of the arbitration deadline, the idea resurfaced. After Rizzo and Boras talked, Rizzo informed Lerner he should contact Boras. Lerner called Boras and invited him to his Palm Springs, Calif., home. \u201cCome look at some art,\u201d Lerner told him.\nMore than the public realized, Lerner viewed Strasburg with great affection. Strasburg in his eyes represented the growth of his franchise, a first overall pick who had validated the Nationals when he signed out of San Diego State, a foundational superstar who brought national attention with his sensational debut at Nationals Park <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span>\nThird baseman Ryan Zimmerman was a National when the Lerner family bought the team, so Strasburg was the Lerners\u2019 first great player and biggest splash. More than that, Lerner admired how Strasburg and Rachel lived quiet and humble lives, unchanged by his stature. He liked them personally and appreciated what Strasburg meant to his team.\nIn early February, Boras drove the two hours from his Newport Beach office to Palm Desert, the town next to Palm Springs. He met Lerner and Annette at Wolfgang Puck\u2019s WP Kitchen + Bar. Over grilled shrimp and pasta, Annette chatted up Boras about art. Ted talked about baseball philosophy and a common perception: that Boras refuses to sign contract extensions, determined instead to take players to free agency. Boras insisted otherwise.\n\u201cNo, I work for players,\u201d he told Lerner. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them what they want to do.\u201d Boras told the Lerners he would speak with Strasburg about an extension. The dinner at King\u2019s Fish House several days later would be the setting.\nThe security of a deal, Boras told Strasburg that evening, would lead to happiness and relaxed performance. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">He laid out the business model of what an extension would look like, telling Strasburg he could expect seven years, with an opt-out clause that would allow him to reenter the free agent market.\n</span>Over the winter, Strasburg had asked himself a simple question: \u201cWhy do I play?\u201d He determined he wanted to win and to enjoy teammates. Both, he believed, could be accomplished with the Nationals. Strasburg also appreciated how the Nationals took care of his body. The team\u2019s unprecedented decision to shut down Strasburg in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2012,</span> in the middle of their first playoff run, following his recovery from arm surgery bothered the right-hander then. But as time passed, Strasburg came to peace with the reasoning.\nThe baseball world thought Strasburg wanted to bolt for his home state in free agency. Even close friends admitted this week that they figured Strasburg would end up in California. The assumptions were wrong, misguided speculation about a cypher. He expressed to Boras a desire to stay.\nWith Strasburg\u2019s blessing, Boras could begin full negotiations. With the Nationals, that meant a kind of triangular discussion. Over the years, as Boras clients Jayson Werth, Rafael Soriano and Max Scherzer signed high-profile free agent deals, the Nationals had developed an unofficial system for dealing with Boras. Rizzo and Lerner would talk about baseball markets and contractual guidelines. Boras would meet in person with Lerner. Lerner and Rizzo would debrief.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">[Max Scherzer\u2019s bravura 20-strikeout performance]\nSo when Lerner told Rizzo he wanted to offer Strasburg a five-year extension <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $100 million</span>, Rizzo had to let him down easy \u2014 that just wasn\u2019t market value.\n</span>Days later, Boras was driving up Frank Sinatra Drive to Tamarisk Country Club, where the Lerners had long been members, a course not far from <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">their 9,500</span>-square foot, six-bedroom Palm Springs home. Boras had met Ted and Annette at the club often enough to know how lunch would go: No matter how much he resisted or explained that he doesn\u2019t eat bread, they would make him try Tamarisk\u2019s renowned cheese bread. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">They chatted about golf and business philosophy and competition.\n</span>They retreated to the Lerners\u2019 home, where Boras had negotiated many deals and taken many meetings. As per their custom, Annette showed Boras one piece from her self-curated collection \u2014 a sculpture, on this day \u2014 and explained its history and how she had acquired it at auction. <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">At 4 p</span>.m., the Lerners\u2019 in-home chef prepared coffee and crispy cinnamon cookies. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The meetings had grown to always be a mix of business and friendship.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s book-worthy,\u201d Boras said. \u201cThe rare thing in life is that \u2014 who gets to talk to someone who is in gym class when Pearl Harbor is bombed and what Roosevelt said and his gym coach is Red Auerbach? Seriously. Ted\u2019s amazing because you sit and you talk to him and you\u2019re going through things for an hour, and then you <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">get 15 minutes</span> of things you\u2019ve never heard anybody say in your life.\u201d\nFor two hours, Boras showed Lerner binders of information about Strasburg\u2019s potential, the needs of opposing teams and revenues across the sport. Lerner wanted to compare Strasburg\u2019s potential deal to those free agent deals signed by former National Jordan Zimmermann with the Detroit Tigers (five years,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $110 million</span> ) and Johnny Cueto with the San Francisco Giants (six years,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $130 million</span> ). Those pitchers, Lerner reasoned, had accomplished more than Strasburg, who had yet to win more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 games</span> in a season and who had tossed more <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 innings</span> just once.\nBoras showed him the recent contracts of the game\u2019s best pitchers \u2014 Clayton Kershaw, Scherzer, Zack Greinke, all Cy Young winners \u2014 and told him to think more along those lines. Boras agreed that Strasburg could not match their accomplishments, and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2010 Tommy</span> John surgery added another risk. But Boras laid out a case for why Strasburg fit between the groups: If his potential filled in, he would accomplish all that those pitchers had and maybe more. He sold Strasburg to Lerner, really, on spec.\nBehind the scenes, the Nationals\u2019 front office treated Strasburg\u2019s extension like an arbitration case, looking up comparable players and contracts. It had reached a conclusion similar to Boras\u2019s, settling on pitchers Justin Verlander with the Detroit Tigers (seven years,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $180 million</span> ) and Felix Hernandez with the Seattle Mariners (seven years,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $175 million</span> ) as models. Even though those two had accomplished more than Strasburg, revenues had increased across the sport since they signed their deals.\nThe key to the negotiation for Boras was to create a contract that could provide Strasburg with long-term comfort but also keep alive the chance to enter free agency after he had accomplished more. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He envisioned Strasburg,<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> having a minimum of <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $220 million</span> guaranteed in his entire career, plus the chance to hit the market <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 30 or</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31 </span>\u2014 as Scherzer and Greinke had done \u2014 with a baseline salary somewhere <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $25 million</span>.</span> He proposed a \u201crolling\u201d opt-out clause that would allow Strasburg to break a contract after three or four seasons.\nBoras made three more trips to Palm Springs over the next two months, all the same routine \u2014 art and crispy cinnamon treats and hammering out the details of Strasburg\u2019s contract. Lerner wanted money deferred to years after the contract\u2019s conclusion, a common arrangement between the sides on prior deals. Boras would accept deferrals in exchange for performance bonuses \u2014<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1 million</span> for every season in which Strasburg <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaches 180 innings</span> pitched \u2014 and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10 million</span> signing bonus to offset the lesser present-day value. Lerner agreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fascinating process when the two of them go at it,\u201d Mark Lerner said. \u201cMy dad, he\u2019s always loved to negotiate, and that\u2019s a classic thing for Scott.\u201d\nLerner and Boras had done enough contracts that those seeming intricacies came together quickly; they even used Scherzer\u2019s contract as a blueprint for how Strasburg would be paid the deferred money. Lerner had made a fortune on far more complex real estate contracts.\nThe hardest part was haggling over the average annual value and total years. Back in February at King\u2019s, Boras had told Strasburg he could expect seven years.

Then Scott Boras made a call.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">It had become a ritual for the Strasburgs of San Diego, an annual opportunity for a young family to sort out business, to assess the past year and look toward the future.</span> Stephen and Rachel, parents to 2-year-old Raegan, would meet for dinner at King\u2019s Fish House with his agent, Scott Boras, in mid-February, before heading to Viera, Fla., and spring training with the Washington Nationals.\nBoras and Scott Chiamparino, a top lieutenant, had driven from his Newport Beach offices. They chose King\u2019s for mutual convenience \u2014 a 10-minute drive from the Strasburgs\u2019 north San Diego offseason home, just off <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 405 for</span> Boras \u2014 and the food. They devoured plates of popcorn shrimp, crab Louie salad, clam chowder, fried fish and, for the health-conscious Strasburg, grilled salmon. Typically, they would use the meeting to discuss the specifics of Strasburg\u2019s arbitration deal. This time, both Boras and Strasburg entered the meal with grander ideas.\nBoras already had engaged in preliminary conversations with top Nationals officials, in both the front office and ownership, regarding signing Strasburg to a long-term contract extension. Strasburg, too, had spent the winter pondering the possibility, weighing his contentment in a city far away from the West Coast of his childhood that had slowly and unexpectedly come to feel like home. Free agency beckoned, but he felt the pull of comfort and familiarity. He wanted, he told Boras over fish and cocktail sauce, to stay in Washington.\nWhen Boras left King\u2019s, walking back to his car under the Southern California moonlight, he believed absolutely something no one else in the baseball world saw coming, even months later, until the news broke Monday night as Strasburg pitched at Nationals Park: Strasburg and the Nationals, he thought, would reach a long-term agreement to extend his contract. He phoned Ted Lerner, the Nationals\u2019 managing principal owner.\n\u201cI think we have an opportunity to put this thing together,\u201d Boras told him.\nThe following account, based on interviews with people directly and indirectly involved on both sides of the negotiations, describes how Strasburg, a former No.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 overall</span> pick as one of the most heralded young pitchers in a generation, and the Nationals agreed on a complex, seven-year extension <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $175 million</span></span>. The dealings offer a window into the often fruitful and uncommonly close relationship between Lerner and Boras, a show of Strasburg\u2019s affinity for Washington and a potential road map for future negotiations over a contract extension for Bryce Harper, Washington\u2019s other No.<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 pick</span> and franchise pillar represented by Boras.\nThe discussions started Jan.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15,</span> a busy day across baseball, the deadline to exchange contract figures for teams and players for salary arbitration. \u201cFrantic Friday, man,\u201d Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said. As Rizzo and Boras negotiated one-year deals for some of Boras\u2019s Nationals clients \u2014 Danny Espinosa, Anthony Rendon and Strasburg himself \u2014 Rizzo broached Strasburg\u2019s future.\nAlthough Strasburg, a natural introvert, had been slow to adjust to public life, Rizzo had seen subtle changes. In recent years, his interactions in Washington gave Rizzo a sense he had grown comfortable in the city. Even though Strasburg had just one season remaining before free agency, a stage at which almost all players choose to have <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 30 teams</span> bid on them, Rizzo believed Strasburg might be interested in a long-term deal.\nThe suggestion didn\u2019t surprise Boras. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The seed had been planted back in November, when Boras and Lerner met at the owners meetings in Boca Raton, Fla. Lerner, the 90-year-old Washington native who became one of America\u2019s wealthiest men through a real estate business he began with a loan from his wife, Annette, outlines his offseason vision at their annual discussion.</span> Boras, the 63-year-old former Class AA infielder who became one of baseball\u2019s most powerful figures, pitches Lerner on available clients.\n\u201cThey have an incredible relationship,\u201d said Mark Lerner, a Nationals principal owner and Ted\u2019s son. \u201cScott really respects my dad and what he\u2019s built over the years from nothing. They enjoy the banter back and forth. It\u2019s an interesting relationship. They know how to get things done.\u201d\n[How the Strasburg deal may affect Bryce Harper\u2019s future]\nBoras explained how Baltimore Orioles slugger Chris Davis would fit into Washington\u2019s lineup, hitting behind Harper. Lerner countered by saying he did not want an exorbitant contract like Davis\u2019s tying up long-term payroll that would hinder signing Strasburg or Harper, who is scheduled to become a free agent after <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 season</span>. Boras made a mental note about Lerner\u2019s desire to lock up Strasburg. Both men knew they would be in touch over the winter.\nOn the day of the arbitration deadline, the idea resurfaced. After Rizzo and Boras talked, Rizzo informed Lerner he should contact Boras. Lerner called Boras and invited him to his Palm Springs, Calif., home. \u201cCome look at some art,\u201d Lerner told him.\nMore than the public realized, Lerner viewed Strasburg with great affection. Strasburg in his eyes represented the growth of his franchise, a first overall pick who had validated the Nationals when he signed out of San Diego State, a foundational superstar who brought national attention with his sensational debut at Nationals Park <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span>\nThird baseman Ryan Zimmerman was a National when the Lerner family bought the team, so Strasburg was the Lerners\u2019 first great player and biggest splash. More than that, Lerner admired how Strasburg and Rachel lived quiet and humble lives, unchanged by his stature. He liked them personally and appreciated what Strasburg meant to his team.\nIn early February, Boras drove the two hours from his Newport Beach office to Palm Desert, the town next to Palm Springs. He met Lerner and Annette at Wolfgang Puck\u2019s WP Kitchen + Bar. Over grilled shrimp and pasta, Annette chatted up Boras about art. Ted talked about baseball philosophy and a common perception: that Boras refuses to sign contract extensions, determined instead to take players to free agency. Boras insisted otherwise.\n\u201cNo, I work for players,\u201d he told Lerner. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them what they want to do.\u201d Boras told the Lerners he would speak with Strasburg about an extension. The dinner at King\u2019s Fish House several days later would be the setting.\nThe security of a deal, Boras told Strasburg that evening, would lead to happiness and relaxed performance. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">He laid out the business model of what an extension would look like, telling Strasburg he could expect seven years, with an opt-out clause that would allow him to reenter the free agent market.\n</span>Over the winter, Strasburg had asked himself a simple question: \u201cWhy do I play?\u201d He determined he wanted to win and to enjoy teammates. Both, he believed, could be accomplished with the Nationals. Strasburg also appreciated how the Nationals took care of his body. The team\u2019s unprecedented decision to shut down Strasburg in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2012,</span> in the middle of their first playoff run, following his recovery from arm surgery bothered the right-hander then. But as time passed, Strasburg came to peace with the reasoning.\nThe baseball world thought Strasburg wanted to bolt for his home state in free agency. Even close friends admitted this week that they figured Strasburg would end up in California. The assumptions were wrong, misguided speculation about a cypher. He expressed to Boras a desire to stay.\nWith Strasburg\u2019s blessing, Boras could begin full negotiations. With the Nationals, that meant a kind of triangular discussion. Over the years, as Boras clients Jayson Werth, Rafael Soriano and Max Scherzer signed high-profile free agent deals, the Nationals had developed an unofficial system for dealing with Boras. Rizzo and Lerner would talk about baseball markets and contractual guidelines. Boras would meet in person with Lerner. Lerner and Rizzo would debrief.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">[Max Scherzer\u2019s bravura 20-strikeout performance]\nSo when Lerner told Rizzo he wanted to offer Strasburg a five-year extension <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $100 million</span>, Rizzo had to let him down easy \u2014 that just wasn\u2019t market value.\n</span>Days later, Boras was driving up Frank Sinatra Drive to Tamarisk Country Club, where the Lerners had long been members, a course not far from <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">their 9,500</span>-square foot, six-bedroom Palm Springs home. Boras had met Ted and Annette at the club often enough to know how lunch would go: No matter how much he resisted or explained that he doesn\u2019t eat bread, they would make him try Tamarisk\u2019s renowned cheese bread. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">They chatted about golf and business philosophy and competition.\n</span>They retreated to the Lerners\u2019 home, where Boras had negotiated many deals and taken many meetings. As per their custom, Annette showed Boras one piece from her self-curated collection \u2014 a sculpture, on this day \u2014 and explained its history and how she had acquired it at auction. <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">At 4 p</span>.m., the Lerners\u2019 in-home chef prepared coffee and crispy cinnamon cookies. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The meetings had grown to always be a mix of business and friendship.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s book-worthy,\u201d Boras said. \u201cThe rare thing in life is that \u2014 who gets to talk to someone who is in gym class when Pearl Harbor is bombed and what Roosevelt said and his gym coach is Red Auerbach? Seriously. Ted\u2019s amazing because you sit and you talk to him and you\u2019re going through things for an hour, and then you <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">get 15 minutes</span> of things you\u2019ve never heard anybody say in your life.\u201d\nFor two hours, Boras showed Lerner binders of information about Strasburg\u2019s potential, the needs of opposing teams and revenues across the sport. Lerner wanted to compare Strasburg\u2019s potential deal to those free agent deals signed by former National Jordan Zimmermann with the Detroit Tigers (five years,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $110 million</span> ) and Johnny Cueto with the San Francisco Giants (six years,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $130 million</span> ). Those pitchers, Lerner reasoned, had accomplished more than Strasburg, who had yet to win more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 games</span> in a season and who had tossed more <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 innings</span> just once.\nBoras showed him the recent contracts of the game\u2019s best pitchers \u2014 Clayton Kershaw, Scherzer, Zack Greinke, all Cy Young winners \u2014 and told him to think more along those lines. Boras agreed that Strasburg could not match their accomplishments, and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2010 Tommy</span> John surgery added another risk. But Boras laid out a case for why Strasburg fit between the groups: If his potential filled in, he would accomplish all that those pitchers had and maybe more. He sold Strasburg to Lerner, really, on spec.\nBehind the scenes, the Nationals\u2019 front office treated Strasburg\u2019s extension like an arbitration case, looking up comparable players and contracts. It had reached a conclusion similar to Boras\u2019s, settling on pitchers Justin Verlander with the Detroit Tigers (seven years,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $180 million</span> ) and Felix Hernandez with the Seattle Mariners (seven years,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $175 million</span> ) as models. Even though those two had accomplished more than Strasburg, revenues had increased across the sport since they signed their deals.\nThe key to the negotiation for Boras was to create a contract that could provide Strasburg with long-term comfort but also keep alive the chance to enter free agency after he had accomplished more. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He envisioned Strasburg,<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> having a minimum of <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $220 million</span> guaranteed in his entire career, plus the chance to hit the market <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 30 or</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31 </span>\u2014 as Scherzer and Greinke had done \u2014 with a baseline salary somewhere <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $25 million</span>.</span> He proposed a \u201crolling\u201d opt-out clause that would allow Strasburg to break a contract after three or four seasons.\nBoras made three more trips to Palm Springs over the next two months, all the same routine \u2014 art and crispy cinnamon treats and hammering out the details of Strasburg\u2019s contract. Lerner wanted money deferred to years after the contract\u2019s conclusion, a common arrangement between the sides on prior deals. Boras would accept deferrals in exchange for performance bonuses \u2014<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1 million</span> for every season in which Strasburg <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaches 180 innings</span> pitched \u2014 and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10 million</span> signing bonus to offset the lesser present-day value. Lerner agreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fascinating process when the two of them go at it,\u201d Mark Lerner said. \u201cMy dad, he\u2019s always loved to negotiate, and that\u2019s a classic thing for Scott.\u201d\nLerner and Boras had done enough contracts that those seeming intricacies came together quickly; they even used Scherzer\u2019s contract as a blueprint for how Strasburg would be paid the deferred money. Lerner had made a fortune on far more complex real estate contracts.\nThe hardest part was haggling over the average annual value and total years. Back in February at King\u2019s, Boras had told Strasburg he could expect seven years. He would not settle for less, even though Lerner had a hard time agreeing to even six.\nDuring the last week of April, with the Miami Marlins in Los Angeles to play the Dodgers, Boras was eating lunch with client Jose Fernandez, the Marlins\u2019 young pitching ace.

The only shared emotion is uncertainty.\nFor a fleeting moment, New York was a city reveling in itself. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Just a month ago officials declared it fully open for business; masks slipped to chins and restaurants packed in customers as vaccines rolled out.</span> The virus seemed to be losing.\nToday, the coronavirus has crept back, in a new, more infectious form that has driven up cases and hospitalizations, primarily among those still refusing vaccination, sending a city just staggering back to life into a tailspin.\nFor some New Yorkers, scarred from the thousands of deaths at the pandemic\u2019s painful peak, every new case, though few in comparison, comes with pit-of-the-stomach foreboding. For others, the spiking rates, and the fact that if infected, few vaccinated people fall gravely ill, portend a new reality of cohabiting with the virus \u2014 maybe indefinitely.\nPerhaps the only shared emotion is uncertainty. As the variant known as Delta entrenches across the city, there are questions in its wake: Is this simply what the future looks like? Despite a maskless, celebratory summer of social closeness, is the pandemic forever?\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the flu, the flu never stops,\u201d said Nelson Lopez,<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 45,</span> a resident of East Harlem, who said he still cannot walk down his block without tallying every neighbor he lost to the virus. \u201cPeople will be afraid forever.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Hua Cheng,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 55,</span> and her husband, Keith Hu,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> both electrical engineers, drove in from their home in Randolph, N.J., to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a city that suddenly once again felt precarious.

The couple are back to wearing masks, even though they are vaccinated, as the Delta variant has continued to spread. \u201cBefore this we didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d Mr. Hu said.\nOn Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that vaccinated people should return to wearing masks in public indoor spaces in areas that have recorded more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50 new</span> infections <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">per 100,000 residents</span> over the previous week, or where more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8 percent</span> of tests are positive for infection over that period.\nAll of New York City\u2019s boroughs fall under those criteria. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has resisted reinstating a mask mandate, said at a news conference on Wednesday that his administration was reviewing the C.D.C. guidelines. The mayor announced that the city would begin <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">giving $100 to</span> residents who get their first dose of a vaccine at a city-run site, starting Friday.\nThe seven-day average of new coronavirus cases is <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 1,000,</span> up from just <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 200 last</span> month, and <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 75 percent</span> are attributed to the Delta variant, according to city data.

The only shared emotion is uncertainty.\nFor a fleeting moment, New York was a city reveling in itself. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Just a month ago officials declared it fully open for business; masks slipped to chins and restaurants packed in customers as vaccines rolled out.</span> The virus seemed to be losing.\nToday, the coronavirus has crept back, in a new, more infectious form that has driven up cases and hospitalizations, primarily among those still refusing vaccination, sending a city just staggering back to life into a tailspin.\nFor some New Yorkers, scarred from the thousands of deaths at the pandemic\u2019s painful peak, every new case, though few in comparison, comes with pit-of-the-stomach foreboding. For others, the spiking rates, and the fact that if infected, few vaccinated people fall gravely ill, portend a new reality of cohabiting with the virus \u2014 maybe indefinitely.\nPerhaps the only shared emotion is uncertainty. As the variant known as Delta entrenches across the city, there are questions in its wake: Is this simply what the future looks like? Despite a maskless, celebratory summer of social closeness, is the pandemic forever?\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the flu, the flu never stops,\u201d said Nelson Lopez,<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 45,</span> a resident of East Harlem, who said he still cannot walk down his block without tallying every neighbor he lost to the virus. \u201cPeople will be afraid forever.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Hua Cheng,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 55,</span> and her husband, Keith Hu,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> both electrical engineers, drove in from their home in Randolph, N.J., to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a city that suddenly once again felt precarious.

He <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 90.</span>\nThe Royal Court said in a statement broadcast across the kingdom that the king had died early Friday. The royal court did not disclose the exact cause of death. An announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said the king had a lung infection when he was admitted on Dec.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31 to</span> a Riyadh hospital.\nThe king\u2019s death adds yet another element of uncertainty in a region already overwhelmed by crises and as Saudi Arabia is itself in a struggle with Iran for regional dominance.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The royal family moved quickly to assure a smooth transition of power in a nation that is a close ally of the United States, the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil and the religious center of the Islamic faith.</span> In a televised statement, a brother of Abdullah, Crown Prince Salman, announced that the king had died and that he had assumed the throne.\nSalman\u2019s ascension appears to signal that the kingdom will preserve its current policies, but he faces exceptional new challenges. Though Saudi Arabia has traditionally preferred to push its agenda through checkbook diplomacy, it has taken a far more muscular approach since the Arab Spring, offering generous support to its allies, like Egypt, while working to oppose adversaries like President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Even as the drop in the price of oil has depleted its own treasury, it has steadfastly refused to cut the supply, hoping to increase market share at the expense of adversaries that are less able to pump oil at low prices.\n</span>\u201cAs our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah\u2019s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship,\u201d President Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. \u201cAs a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.\u201d\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he was to lead the American delegation \u201cto pay our respects and offer condolences.\u201d\nAccidents of birth and geology made Abdullah one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful men. In control of a fifth of the world\u2019s known petroleum reserves, he traveled to medical appointments abroad in a fleet of jumbo jets, and the changes he wrought in Saudi society were fueled by gushers of oil money.\nAs king he also bore the title of custodian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, making him one of the faith\u2019s most important figures.\nAbdullah had grown accustomed to the levers of power long before his ascension to the throne in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2005.</span></span> After his predecessor, King Fahd, a half brother, had a stroke in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 1995,</span> Abdullah, then the crown prince, ruled in the king\u2019s name.\nYet Abdullah spoke as plainly as the Bedouin tribesmen with whom he had been sent to live in his youth. He refused to be called \u201cyour majesty\u201d and discouraged commoners from kissing his hand. He shocked <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 7,000 or</span> so Saudi princes and princesses by cutting their allowances. He was described as ascetic, or as ascetic as someone in the habit of renting out entire hotels could be.\nAbdullah\u2019s reign was a constant effort to balance desert traditions with the demands of the modern world, making him appear at times to be shifting from one to the other.\nWhen popular movements and insurgencies overthrew or threatened long-established Arab rulers from Tunisia to Yemen <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span> he reacted swiftly.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">On his return from three months of treatment for a herniated disk and a blood clot in New York and Morocco, his government <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent $130 billion</span> to <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">build 500,000 units</span> of low-income housing, to bolster the salaries of government employees and to ensure the loyalty of religious organizations.\n</span>He also created a Facebook page, where citizens were invited to present their grievances directly to him, although it was not known how many entries actually reached him.\nBut in at least two telephone calls he castigated President Obama for encouraging democracy in the Middle East, saying it was dangerous. And he showed no tolerance for the sort of dissent unfolding elsewhere.\nThe grand mufti, the kingdom\u2019s highest religious official, proclaimed that Islam forbade street protests. Scores of protesters who failed to heed that message were arrested in the chiefly Shiite eastern provinces. A new law imposed crippling fines for offenses, like threatening national security, that could be broadly interpreted. Reaching beyond his borders, Abdullah sent tanks to help quell an uprising in neighboring Bahrain.\nMoves of Moderation\nStill, Abdullah became, in some ways, a force of moderation. He contested Al Qaeda\u2019s militant interpretations of the faith as justifying, even compelling, terrorist acts. He ordered that textbooks be purged of their most extreme language and <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 900 imams</span> to re-education sessions. He had hundreds of militants arrested and some beheaded.\nBut he was also mindful that his family had, since the 18th century, derived its authority from an alliance with the strict Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam. He accordingly made only modest changes to the kingdom\u2019s conservative clerical establishment. When Islamic State forces conquered vast stretches of Syria and Iraq, imposing a creed linked to Saudi Arabia\u2019s own, the kingdom was slow to respond.\nHowever, Abdullah chastised senior clerics for not speaking out more forcibly against the jihadists, and he eventually sent Saudi pilots to participate in an American-led campaign against the Islamic State.\nAbdullah\u2019s Saudi Arabia had hurtled from tribal pastoralism to advanced capitalism in little more than a generation. The fundamentalist clerics who gave the family legitimacy remained a powerful force. Women who appeared in public without the required covering risked arrest or a beating from the religious police.\nAbdullah did make changes that were seen as important in the Saudi context. He allowed women to work as supermarket cashiers and appointed a woman as a deputy minister. At <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $12.5 billion</span> research university he built and named for himself, women study beside men.\nHowever, he did not fulfill a promise made to Barbara Walters of ABC News in his first televised interview as king in October 2005: that he would allow women to drive, a hugely contentious issue in Saudi Arabia.\nAlthough he ordered the kingdom\u2019s first elections for municipal councils <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span> a promised second election, in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2009,</span> in which women would vote, was postponed until <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2011.</span> Then in March of that year, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs announced that the question of women voting would be put off indefinitely \u201cbecause of the kingdom\u2019s social customs.\u201d\nAbdullah\u2019s greatest legacy, however, may prove to be a scholarship program that sent tens of thousands of young Saudi men and women abroad to study at Western universities and colleges. It has been suggested that the changes long resisted by conservative forces \u2014 resistance that even a king could not overcome \u2014 would one day come about as those men and women rose in the government, industry and academia.\nPerhaps Abdullah\u2019s most daunting challenge arrived in the wake of the Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks, with the revelation <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 15 of</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 19 hijackers</span> were Saudis. The royal family at first railed at what it called a vicious smear campaign against the kingdom, then ruthlessly suppressed known militants \u2014 not least because the monarchy itself was a main target of Al Qaeda.\nStriking a balance was almost always Abdullah\u2019s preference. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He strove to keep oil prices high, but not so high that they prompted consumers to abandon petroleum, then hedged his bets by investing billions in solar energy research.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he convened a meeting of world religious leaders to promote tolerance, but held it in Madrid rather than Saudi Arabia, where the public practice of religions other than Islam is outlawed.\nYet Abdullah could, and did, take strong positions. He denounced the American-led invasion of Iraq as \u201can illegal occupation\u201d; proposed a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East that included recognition of Israel by Arab nations; and urged in a secret cable that the United States attack Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s great rival. \u201cCut off the head off the snake,\u201d he said.\nHis kingdom\u2019s interests always came first. Although American companies discovered and developed the Saudi oil fields, he cut deals with Russian, Chinese and European petroleum companies. He made it clear that the world\u2019s energy appetites mattered less than Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.\nA Rigorous Upbringing\nAbdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud was born in Riyadh <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1924 into</span> a vast, complicated family. His father, Abdul Aziz, had as many <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 22 wives</span>.\nAbdul Aziz, whose ancestors founded a precursor to the present Saudi state <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1744,</span> chose his wives partly to secure alliances with other Arabian tribes. Abdullah\u2019s mother, Fahda bint Asi al-Shuraim, was a daughter of the chief of the Shammar, whose influence extended into Syria, Iraq and Jordan.\nAbdullah was Fahda\u2019s only son. She also had two daughters.\nKing Abdul Aziz was not an indulgent father to his dozens of sons. He was quoted as saying, \u201cI train my own children to walk barefoot, to rise two hours before dawn, to eat but little, to ride horses bareback.\u201d\nWhen the young Abdullah once neglected to offer his seat to a guest, Abdul Aziz sentenced him to three days in prison.\nAbdullah, who overcame a stutter, was educated in religion, Arab literature and science by Islamic scholars at the royal court. From the Bedouin nomads, he learned traditional ways, including horsemanship and desert warfare. <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1962,</span> he was appointed commander of the National Guard, which draws recruits from the Bedouin tribes, protects the king and acts as a counterweight to the army.\nFour of Abdullah\u2019s half brothers preceded him to the throne.\nKing Khalid appointed Abdullah as second deputy prime minister <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1975.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1982,</span> Fahd, Khalid\u2019s successor, named him deputy prime minister and crown prince.\nAfter Fahd\u2019s stroke, Abdullah ran the government at first as regent. Political pressures later forced the removal of the regent title, but Abdullah remained the effective decision maker. He refused to sign any official papers with his own name as long as his stricken brother lived.

It was Friday, not Thursday.", "displayed_text": "<h3>King Abdullah, a Shrewd Force Who Reshaped Saudi Arabia, Dies at 90</h3>King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who came to the throne in old age and earned a reputation as a cautious reformer even as the Arab Spring revolts toppled heads of state and Islamic State militants threatened the Muslim establishment that he represented, died on Friday, according to a statement on state television. He <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 90.</span>\nThe Royal Court said in a statement broadcast across the kingdom that the king had died early Friday. The royal court did not disclose the exact cause of death. An announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said the king had a lung infection when he was admitted on Dec.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31 to</span> a Riyadh hospital.\nThe king\u2019s death adds yet another element of uncertainty in a region already overwhelmed by crises and as Saudi Arabia is itself in a struggle with Iran for regional dominance.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The royal family moved quickly to assure a smooth transition of power in a nation that is a close ally of the United States, the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil and the religious center of the Islamic faith.</span> In a televised statement, a brother of Abdullah, Crown Prince Salman, announced that the king had died and that he had assumed the throne.\nSalman\u2019s ascension appears to signal that the kingdom will preserve its current policies, but he faces exceptional new challenges. Though Saudi Arabia has traditionally preferred to push its agenda through checkbook diplomacy, it has taken a far more muscular approach since the Arab Spring, offering generous support to its allies, like Egypt, while working to oppose adversaries like President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Even as the drop in the price of oil has depleted its own treasury, it has steadfastly refused to cut the supply, hoping to increase market share at the expense of adversaries that are less able to pump oil at low prices.\n</span>\u201cAs our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah\u2019s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship,\u201d President Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. \u201cAs a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.\u201d\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he was to lead the American delegation \u201cto pay our respects and offer condolences.\u201d\nAccidents of birth and geology made Abdullah one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful men. In control of a fifth of the world\u2019s known petroleum reserves, he traveled to medical appointments abroad in a fleet of jumbo jets, and the changes he wrought in Saudi society were fueled by gushers of oil money.\nAs king he also bore the title of custodian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, making him one of the faith\u2019s most important figures.\nAbdullah had grown accustomed to the levers of power long before his ascension to the throne in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2005.</span></span> After his predecessor, King Fahd, a half brother, had a stroke in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 1995,</span> Abdullah, then the crown prince, ruled in the king\u2019s name.\nYet Abdullah spoke as plainly as the Bedouin tribesmen with whom he had been sent to live in his youth. He refused to be called \u201cyour majesty\u201d and discouraged commoners from kissing his hand. He shocked <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 7,000 or</span> so Saudi princes and princesses by cutting their allowances. He was described as ascetic, or as ascetic as someone in the habit of renting out entire hotels could be.\nAbdullah\u2019s reign was a constant effort to balance desert traditions with the demands of the modern world, making him appear at times to be shifting from one to the other.\nWhen popular movements and insurgencies overthrew or threatened long-established Arab rulers from Tunisia to Yemen <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span> he reacted swiftly.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">On his return from three months of treatment for a herniated disk and a blood clot in New York and Morocco, his government <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent $130 billion</span> to <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">build 500,000 units</span> of low-income housing, to bolster the salaries of government employees and to ensure the loyalty of religious organizations.\n</span>He also created a Facebook page, where citizens were invited to present their grievances directly to him, although it was not known how many entries actually reached him.\nBut in at least two telephone calls he castigated President Obama for encouraging democracy in the Middle East, saying it was dangerous. And he showed no tolerance for the sort of dissent unfolding elsewhere.\nThe grand mufti, the kingdom\u2019s highest religious official, proclaimed that Islam forbade street protests. Scores of protesters who failed to heed that message were arrested in the chiefly Shiite eastern provinces. A new law imposed crippling fines for offenses, like threatening national security, that could be broadly interpreted. Reaching beyond his borders, Abdullah sent tanks to help quell an uprising in neighboring Bahrain.\nMoves of Moderation\nStill, Abdullah became, in some ways, a force of moderation. He contested Al Qaeda\u2019s militant interpretations of the faith as justifying, even compelling, terrorist acts. He ordered that textbooks be purged of their most extreme language and <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 900 imams</span> to re-education sessions. He had hundreds of militants arrested and some beheaded.\nBut he was also mindful that his family had, since the 18th century, derived its authority from an alliance with the strict Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam. He accordingly made only modest changes to the kingdom\u2019s conservative clerical establishment. When Islamic State forces conquered vast stretches of Syria and Iraq, imposing a creed linked to Saudi Arabia\u2019s own, the kingdom was slow to respond.\nHowever, Abdullah chastised senior clerics for not speaking out more forcibly against the jihadists, and he eventually sent Saudi pilots to participate in an American-led campaign against the Islamic State.\nAbdullah\u2019s Saudi Arabia had hurtled from tribal pastoralism to advanced capitalism in little more than a generation. The fundamentalist clerics who gave the family legitimacy remained a powerful force. Women who appeared in public without the required covering risked arrest or a beating from the religious police.\nAbdullah did make changes that were seen as important in the Saudi context. He allowed women to work as supermarket cashiers and appointed a woman as a deputy minister. At <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $12.5 billion</span> research university he built and named for himself, women study beside men.\nHowever, he did not fulfill a promise made to Barbara Walters of ABC News in his first televised interview as king in October 2005: that he would allow women to drive, a hugely contentious issue in Saudi Arabia.\nAlthough he ordered the kingdom\u2019s first elections for municipal councils <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span> a promised second election, in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2009,</span> in which women would vote, was postponed until <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2011.</span> Then in March of that year, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs announced that the question of women voting would be put off indefinitely \u201cbecause of the kingdom\u2019s social customs.\u201d\nAbdullah\u2019s greatest legacy, however, may prove to be a scholarship program that sent tens of thousands of young Saudi men and women abroad to study at Western universities and colleges. It has been suggested that the changes long resisted by conservative forces \u2014 resistance that even a king could not overcome \u2014 would one day come about as those men and women rose in the government, industry and academia.\nPerhaps Abdullah\u2019s most daunting challenge arrived in the wake of the Sept.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks, with the revelation <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 15 of</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 19 hijackers</span> were Saudis. The royal family at first railed at what it called a vicious smear campaign against the kingdom, then ruthlessly suppressed known militants \u2014 not least because the monarchy itself was a main target of Al Qaeda.\nStriking a balance was almost always Abdullah\u2019s preference. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He strove to keep oil prices high, but not so high that they prompted consumers to abandon petroleum, then hedged his bets by investing billions in solar energy research.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he convened a meeting of world religious leaders to promote tolerance, but held it in Madrid rather than Saudi Arabia, where the public practice of religions other than Islam is outlawed.\nYet Abdullah could, and did, take strong positions. He denounced the American-led invasion of Iraq as \u201can illegal occupation\u201d; proposed a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East that included recognition of Israel by Arab nations; and urged in a secret cable that the United States attack Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s great rival. \u201cCut off the head off the snake,\u201d he said.\nHis kingdom\u2019s interests always came first. Although American companies discovered and developed the Saudi oil fields, he cut deals with Russian, Chinese and European petroleum companies. He made it clear that the world\u2019s energy appetites mattered less than Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.\nA Rigorous Upbringing\nAbdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud was born in Riyadh <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1924 into</span> a vast, complicated family. His father, Abdul Aziz, had as many <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 22 wives</span>.\nAbdul Aziz, whose ancestors founded a precursor to the present Saudi state <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1744,</span> chose his wives partly to secure alliances with other Arabian tribes. Abdullah\u2019s mother, Fahda bint Asi al-Shuraim, was a daughter of the chief of the Shammar, whose influence extended into Syria, Iraq and Jordan.\nAbdullah was Fahda\u2019s only son. She also had two daughters.\nKing Abdul Aziz was not an indulgent father to his dozens of sons. He was quoted as saying, \u201cI train my own children to walk barefoot, to rise two hours before dawn, to eat but little, to ride horses bareback.\u201d\nWhen the young Abdullah once neglected to offer his seat to a guest, Abdul Aziz sentenced him to three days in prison.\nAbdullah, who overcame a stutter, was educated in religion, Arab literature and science by Islamic scholars at the royal court. From the Bedouin nomads, he learned traditional ways, including horsemanship and desert warfare. <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1962,</span> he was appointed commander of the National Guard, which draws recruits from the Bedouin tribes, protects the king and acts as a counterweight to the army.\nFour of Abdullah\u2019s half brothers preceded him to the throne.\nKing Khalid appointed Abdullah as second deputy prime minister <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1975.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1982,</span> Fahd, Khalid\u2019s successor, named him deputy prime minister and crown prince.\nAfter Fahd\u2019s stroke, Abdullah ran the government at first as regent. Political pressures later forced the removal of the regent title, but Abdullah remained the effective decision maker. He refused to sign any official papers with his own name as long as his stricken brother lived. Fahd died on Aug.<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2005.</span>\nOne of King Abdullah\u2019s first official acts was to pardon two Libyans accused of plotting to kill him, a result of Egypt\u2019s engineering a reconciliation between the two nations.
