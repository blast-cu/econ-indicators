Her line caters to those who aspire to passions beyond clothes but have the means to buy\u2014and buy a lot. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Since the inception of her namesake label <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> sales have increased at a <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady 30 percent</span> each year\u2014even during the economic downturn\u2014allowing her to prosper as an independent label in an era of behemoths like LVMH, Prada Group and Kering.</span> There <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 13 of</span> her sparely designed Isabel Marant boutiques in countries from South Korea to Lebanon, and both of her lines (there is also a diffusion label, Isabel Marant \u00c9toile) are carried <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 800 retailers</span> worldwide. This November, she will join the ranks of Stella McCartney, Versace, Lanvin and Karl Lagerfeld as the next designer to collaborate with global mass retailer H&M, where she will also debut a men's collection.\n\nIt's a long way from her first fashion show in a Paris squat nearly two decades ago, when her designs were sought out by her friends: fashion editors, stylists and the models who walked her runway. Their nonchalant combinations of Marant's casually sexy jeans and T-shirts with a cropped jacket perfectly slung over their shoulders introduced a new fashion vernacular and quickly garnered attention from street-style photographers and beyond. Initially, however, Marant remained largely an insiders-only secret. \"I remember when Sofia Coppola and Gwyneth Paltrow came to my shop in Paris and brought stuff back to the States,\" she says. \"It didn't exist anywhere.<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nToday,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 90 percent</span> of the company's sales are outside of France, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 25 percent</span> in the United States.</span> \"We have some customers who call every week asking about new deliveries,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president at Barneys. \"They pore through the lookbook each season to reserve items long before the styles hit the floor.\"\n\nMarant declines to acknowledge these measures as the standard of success. \"I once said that I'm anti-consumerist, and that goes against the work I do,\" she says. \"It caused a scandal: 'Who is she to think that? She is going against her clientele.' But I do fashion because I'm happy when somebody gets joy from a new garment. There is a magic side to this.\"\n\nON A GRAY PARIS DAY in late June, Marant is sitting at a gleaming white table in the spacious two-story atrium of her headquarters just off the Place des Victoires. Errant sunbeams pierce the clouds and illuminate the vast concrete-floored space. In front of her is a vase of white peonies and jasmine. She wears a loose sweatshirt with \"Mister Freedom\" written on it, the frayed collar stretched out and exposing the straps of her black tank. Her look is rounded out with gray corduroys, a studded black leather belt and ballet flats.\n\n\"I always wear my own clothes,\" she says. \"My sweatshirt I got in L.A., but the rest is Isabel Marant, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 99 percent</span> of my wardrobe.\" She laughs and adds, \"I get a good discount. She's very nice to me.\" In fact, Marant always begins her design process with herself and her own desires. \"I don't dress up every day. I wear a sweatshirt and a trouser, like most people. From this starting point, [I ask myself], How do I make this silhouette fashionable and stylish?\"\n\n\"It's about the women surrounding me,\" she continues. \"I look at how women in the street wear things. I've never been inspired by a muse\u2014that's a fantasy.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Marant doesn't bother doing eveningwear: In punk parlance, she is more Patti Smith than Deborah Harry. Her greatest hit, a clever high-top suede sneaker called the Bobby that camouflages an interior wedge heel (which sells for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $650 and</span> is often marked up to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $850 on</span> eBay), is perhaps the best distillation of her dressed-up version of dressed-down cool. With the Bobby (soon followed by the Bekket, a pumped-up variation with Velcro straps), Marant created a new staple of the women's contemporary wardrobe\u2014and today, seemingly every brand that produces footwear makes a version. When asked about knockoffs, from which she often suffers, Marant exhales and says in a measured tone: \"You are super pissed-off, but if you are not copied, it means you are not 'the one.' What I don't like is that it spreads your style everywhere. Something you are doing gets old in a minute. It takes such time to achieve something well and find the right way of doing things. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing her instincts has generally served Marant well. \"Usually my favorite is what is going to sell,\" she says. \"It's rare that something I really love doesn't sell. It honestly almost never happens. With the sneakers, I knew it was something. I said, 'That's going to be a hit.' I can feel it when I do something right, and I can feel it when I do something only so-so.\" She continues, \"During my entire career I've done maybe five pieces like this. It's rare\u2014when it happens your heart is beating.\" (The other items she counts in this stratosphere are perennials like the Dicker suede ankle boots, as well as her washed linen T-shirts, embroidered jeans and a men's overcoat that has appeared in many iterations.)\n\nShe begins rolling a cigarette. Her process is arduous. \"This takes time,\" she says. \"Instead of smoking a pack a day, I smoke four cigarettes. I spend less and smoke less.\" She doesn't buy loose tobacco, instead buying a pack of Bastos cigarettes. She shreds one and empties the tobacco into a candy tin. She then pulls out the rolling papers. \"I quit smoking for a year, and I <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">gained 10 kilos</span> [22 pounds],\" she says. \"It's not me. I was not feeling myself anymore. It was breaking my brain.\"\n\nIn person, Marant is a strikingly natural beauty. She wears no makeup and her hair, a multitude of varying shades of gray and amber, is pulled back in a messy bun. \"I think sometimes I should dye it,\" she says. \"And then I say, 'No, Isabel. That's how it is. Don't worry. That's life.' \" When she smiles (which is often), her entire face creases and the ends of her large, toothy mouth almost touch her eyes. She is gracefully slim, and her uniform of menswear staples only serves to heighten her femininity.\n\nHer low-key look seems to be part of her emphatic refusal to partake in the pantomime of the fashion swirl. \"I'm not this goddess of fashion\u2014I'm low profile. I look like a delivery guy,\" she says. \"I drive my scooter and always have my helmet on. When people meet me, they think this cannot be her, because I look like a bum.\"\n\nHer eclectic design ethos had its beginnings in Marant's own family. Her father, a photographer, had already been divorced once before marrying her mother, a German model. (His first marriage didn't last long, but produced a half-brother). After Marant's mother, her father's next wife was a Caribbean \u00e9migr\u00e9e.\n\n\"Everybody is linked,\" Marant says of her large family. \"I never understood those people who loved each other <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 10 years</span>, and all of a sudden they don't. That wasn't the spirit of my family. We do Christmas with the three wives of my father, even after he died. They are all my mothers.\"\n\nTheir differing personal styles amalgamated into Marant's own vision. \"My mother is quite German,\" she says, \"Very bio-ecologique\u2014very respectful to nature. My Caribbean mother is an amazing, beautiful black woman and was dressed head-to-toe in Yves Saint Laurent in the '80s. I think I got the attitude and elegance from her, this kind of French chic.\"\n\nMarant was raised in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and lived with her father and Caribbean stepmom, whose family she frequently visited in Martinique. \"They became my family,\" says Marant, who learned to speak Creole. \"They lived in a very simple way in little wooden houses, and I fell in love with this way of life. They grew their own vegetables and had no electricity. I was always amazed that you don't need a lot to be happy. I am very 'less is more' in my spirit.\" (She has since replicated that way of life with a weekend cabin near Paris that doesn't have electricity or running water.)\n\nAs a teen, Marant made her first strides in fashion by reworking vintage army jackets and her father's silk bathrobes for herself. She'd leave the house dressed demurely, \"but I had a plastic bag of stuff and I would go to the next building and change,\" she says. After high school, she attended the Studio Ber\u00e7ot fashion school in Paris. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She started an accessories line <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1989,</span> followed by launching a self-financed womenswear line in a tiny studio <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span></span> when she was <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 26 years</span> old.\n\n</span>Several years later, she fell in love with accessories designer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dreyfuss, who now has stores next to hers in Paris's 6th arrondissement and in New York's Soho. She says the two regard work as a separate endeavor, and don't swap ideas. \"It's very restful,\" she says. \"My previous boyfriends all said, 'You spend all the time at the office and don't love me.' I never have to justify myself to J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and we never talk about fashion. We don't need to have that conversation.\"\n\nMarant is quite content to have those conversations with herself. In recent years, she has mined Americana for her collections\u2014surf, cowgirl, Elvis, Navajo theme, with studs and grommets galore\u2014but her fall/<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">winter 2013 collection</span> was a staid departure. What came down the runway was a back-to-basics collection of solid navy, black, cream and gray, albeit with other instant hits: from a perfectly mannish coat to a black suede and leather knee boot. Marant says she was partially inspired by the increasingly morose 24-hour news cycle of war and disaster. \"I had a kind of sadness,\" she says. \"I was a bit gray in my head. What surrounded me were difficult times, all the troubles of the world. I wanted to do something that was clean and clear.\"\n\nTomorrow, she is off to her cabin in the woods of Fontainebleau,<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35 miles</span> southeast of Paris, where she heads every weekend to shake off the toils of the week. Next door is her mother, with whom her stepmother sometime stays. The Marant-Dreyfusses often entertain: \"I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 20 friends</span> coming Sunday for a barbecue,\" she says. \"I love cooking\u2014all of my moms and my father taught me. We love life: good food, good drink, good pleasure, good laughs. We are epicureans.\" And while others might see the lack of electricity and water as an inconvenience, for Marant, it's the reverse: \"If you have a nice house outside of Paris,\" she explains, \"you have to fix the heater or the roof is broken. I don't need that. On weekends I want to empty my head and be surrounded by green nature and breathe. I need balance.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nShe is still seeking to find that balance in her business\u2014although it's a struggle that would seem like a luxury to many of her rivals.</span> \"I don't want to be on every corner.

I know that my speech has been the subject of much controversy. I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political. That was never my intention.\nI want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans, for your common support for Israel, year after year, decade after decade.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI know that no matter on which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States has always been above politics. It must always remain above politics.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBecause America and Israel, we share a common destiny, the destiny of promised lands that cherish freedom and offer hope. Israel is grateful for the support of American \u2014 of America\u2019s people and of America\u2019s presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)\nNETANYAHU: We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel.\nNow, some of that is widely known.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSome of that is widely known, like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing, opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.\nSome of what the president has done for Israel is less well known.\nI called him <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 when</span> we had the Carmel forest fire, and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> we had our embassy in Cairo under siege, and again, he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment.\nOr his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on Hamas terrorists.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIn each of those moments, I called the president, and he was there.\nAnd some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister.\nBut I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.(APPLAUSE)\nNETANYAHU: And Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support, for supporting us in so many ways, especially in generous military assistance and missile defense, including Iron Dome.\n(APPLAUSE)\nLast summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you, America. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for Israel.\nMy friends, I\u2019ve come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons.\nWe\u2019re an ancient people. In our <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 4,000 years</span> of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we\u2019ll read the Book of Esther. We\u2019ll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 2,500 years</span> ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies.\nThe plot was foiled. Our people were saved.\n(APPLAUSE)\nToday the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology. He tweets that Israel must be annihilated \u2014 he tweets. You know, in Iran, there isn\u2019t exactly free Internet. But he tweets in English that Israel must be destroyed.\nFor those who believe that Iran threatens the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people, listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s chief terrorist proxy. He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world.\nBut Iran\u2019s regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazi regime was merely a Jewish problem. <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 6 million</span> Jews murdered by the Nazis were but a fraction of <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 60 million</span> people killed in World War II. So, too, Iran\u2019s regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world. To understand just how dangerous Iran would be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand the nature of the regime.\nThe people of Iran are very talented people. They\u2019re heirs to one of the world\u2019s great civilizations. But <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1979,</span> they were hijacked by religious zealots \u2014 religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.\nThat year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for Iran. It directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect Iran\u2019s borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The regime\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, exhorted his followers to \u201cexport the revolution throughout the world.\u201d\n</span>I\u2019m standing here in Washington, D.C. and the difference is so stark. America\u2019s founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Iran\u2019s founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad. And as states are collapsing across the Middle East, Iran is charging into the void to do just that.\nIran\u2019s goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon, its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights are clutching Israel with three tentacles of terror. Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians. Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq. Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world\u2019s oil supply.\n</span>Just last week, near Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier. That\u2019s just last week, while they\u2019re having nuclear talks with the United States. But unfortunately, for the <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 36 years</span>, Iran\u2019s attacks against the United States have been anything but mock. And the targets have been all too real.\nIran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran, murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines, in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBeyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. It helped Al Qaeda bomb U.S. embassies in Africa. It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.\nIn the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana. And if Iran\u2019s aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.\nSo, at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe must all stand together to stop Iran\u2019s march of conquest, subjugation and terror.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow, two years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran. Some change! Some moderation! Rouhani\u2019s government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before.\nLast year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I\u2019d like to see someone ask him a question about that.\nIran\u2019s regime is as radical as ever, its cries of \u201cDeath to America,\u201d that same America that it calls the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d as loud as ever.\nNow, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because the ideology of Iran\u2019s revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that\u2019s why this regime will always be an enemy of America.\nDon\u2019t be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn\u2019t turn Iran into a friend of America.\nIran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.\nIn this deadly game of thrones, there\u2019s no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don\u2019t share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone.\nSo when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube, whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. We must always remember \u2014 I\u2019ll say it one more time \u2014 the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can\u2019t let that happen.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.\nLet me explain why. While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don\u2019t need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.\nAbsent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran.\nThe first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. Breakout time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.\nAccording to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed.\nBecause Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short \u2014 about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s.\nAnd if \u2014 if Iran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.\nTrue, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Iran\u2019s adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here\u2019s the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don\u2019t stop them.\nInspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn\u2019t stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb.\nNow, we\u2019re warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100 nuclear</span> bombs.\nLike North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It\u2019s done that on at least three separate occasions \u2014<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2005,</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2006,</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010.</span> Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.\nNow, I know this is not gonna come a shock \u2014 as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.\nThe U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught \u2014 caught twice, not once, twice \u2014 operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn\u2019t even know existed.\nRight now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don\u2019t know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 20 years</span> that it doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that\u2019s why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.\nBut the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.\nNow, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs.\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 190,000 centrifuges</span></span>, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">not 6,000 or</span> even <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 19,000 that</span> Iran has today, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">but 10 times</span> that amount \u2014<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 190,000 centrifuges</span> enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision.\nMy long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.\nNow I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.\nAnd by the way, if Iran\u2019s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.\nSo you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That\u2019s why this deal is so bad. It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb; it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.\nSo why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse?\nWell, I disagree. I don\u2019t believe that Iran\u2019s radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 36 years</span>, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would whet appetite \u2014 would only whet Iran\u2019s appetite for more.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger?</span> If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it\u2019s under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism?\nWhy should Iran\u2019s radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world\u2019s: aggression abroad, prosperity at home?\nThis is a question that everyone asks in our region. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Israel\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Iran\u2019s neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it\u2019s been given a clear path to the bomb.\n</span>And many of these neighbors say they\u2019ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won\u2019t change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.\nThis deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.\nIf anyone thinks \u2014 if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we\u2019ll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.\nLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve come here today to tell you we don\u2019t have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don\u2019t have to gamble with our future and with our children\u2019s future.\nWe can insist that restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.(APPLAUSE)\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things.</span> First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSecond, stop supporting terrorism around the world.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you.\nIf the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIf Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn\u2019t change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIf Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)\nMy friends, what about the argument that there\u2019s no alternative to this deal, that Iran\u2019s nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?\nWell, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn\u2019t get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can\u2019t drive. A pilot without a plan can\u2019t fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can\u2019t make nuclear weapons.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">(APPLAUSE)\nIran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.\n</span>(APPLAUSE)\nNow, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table \u2014 and this often happens in a Persian bazaar \u2014 call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.\n(APPLAUSE)\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.\n</span>My friends, for over a year, we\u2019ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow we\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That\u2019s just not true.\nThe alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.\n(APPLAUSE)\nA better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.\n(APPLAUSE)\nA better deal that won\u2019t give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... no country has a greater stake \u2014 no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.\nLadies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths. One path leads to a bad deal that will at best curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war.\nThe second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal, that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity.\nYou don\u2019t have to read Robert Frost to know. You have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East and the peace of the world, the peace, we all desire.\n(APPLAUSE)\nMy friend, standing up to Iran is not easy. Standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is. With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel.(APPLAUSE)\nElie, your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words, \u201cnever again.\u201d\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNot to sacrifice the future for the present; not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace.\nBut I can guarantee you this, the days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over.(APPLAUSE)\nWe are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves. We restored our sovereignty in our ancient home. And the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 100 generations</span>, we, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThis is why \u2014 this is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI know that you stand with Israel.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou stand with Israel, because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history\u2019s horrors.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFacing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking all of us in this (inaudible) chamber is the image of Moses. Moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the Promised Land.\nAnd before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. I leave you with his message today, (SPEAKING IN HEBREW), \u201cBe strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.\u201d\nMy friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.\nMay God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you. Thank you very much.

Israel is grateful for the support of American \u2014 of America\u2019s people and of America\u2019s presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)\nNETANYAHU: We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel.\nNow, some of that is widely known.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSome of that is widely known, like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing, opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.\nSome of what the president has done for Israel is less well known.\nI called him <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 when</span> we had the Carmel forest fire, and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> we had our embassy in Cairo under siege, and again, he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment.\nOr his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on Hamas terrorists.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIn each of those moments, I called the president, and he was there.\nAnd some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister.\nBut I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.(APPLAUSE)\nNETANYAHU: And Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support, for supporting us in so many ways, especially in generous military assistance and missile defense, including Iron Dome.\n(APPLAUSE)\nLast summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you, America. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for Israel.\nMy friends, I\u2019ve come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons.\nWe\u2019re an ancient people. In our <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 4,000 years</span> of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we\u2019ll read the Book of Esther. We\u2019ll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 2,500 years</span> ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies.\nThe plot was foiled. Our people were saved.\n(APPLAUSE)\nToday the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology. He tweets that Israel must be annihilated \u2014 he tweets. You know, in Iran, there isn\u2019t exactly free Internet. But he tweets in English that Israel must be destroyed.\nFor those who believe that Iran threatens the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people, listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s chief terrorist proxy. He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world.\nBut Iran\u2019s regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazi regime was merely a Jewish problem. <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 6 million</span> Jews murdered by the Nazis were but a fraction of <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 60 million</span> people killed in World War II. So, too, Iran\u2019s regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world. To understand just how dangerous Iran would be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand the nature of the regime.\nThe people of Iran are very talented people. They\u2019re heirs to one of the world\u2019s great civilizations. But <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1979,</span> they were hijacked by religious zealots \u2014 religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.\nThat year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for Iran. It directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect Iran\u2019s borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The regime\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, exhorted his followers to \u201cexport the revolution throughout the world.\u201d\n</span>I\u2019m standing here in Washington, D.C. and the difference is so stark. America\u2019s founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Iran\u2019s founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad. And as states are collapsing across the Middle East, Iran is charging into the void to do just that.\nIran\u2019s goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon, its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights are clutching Israel with three tentacles of terror. Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians. Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq. Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world\u2019s oil supply.\n</span>Just last week, near Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier. That\u2019s just last week, while they\u2019re having nuclear talks with the United States. But unfortunately, for the <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 36 years</span>, Iran\u2019s attacks against the United States have been anything but mock. And the targets have been all too real.\nIran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran, murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines, in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBeyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. It helped Al Qaeda bomb U.S. embassies in Africa. It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.\nIn the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana. And if Iran\u2019s aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.\nSo, at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe must all stand together to stop Iran\u2019s march of conquest, subjugation and terror.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow, two years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran. Some change! Some moderation! Rouhani\u2019s government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before.\nLast year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I\u2019d like to see someone ask him a question about that.\nIran\u2019s regime is as radical as ever, its cries of \u201cDeath to America,\u201d that same America that it calls the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d as loud as ever.\nNow, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because the ideology of Iran\u2019s revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that\u2019s why this regime will always be an enemy of America.\nDon\u2019t be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn\u2019t turn Iran into a friend of America.\nIran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire.\nIn this deadly game of thrones, there\u2019s no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don\u2019t share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone.\nSo when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube, whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. We must always remember \u2014 I\u2019ll say it one more time \u2014 the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can\u2019t let that happen.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.\nLet me explain why. While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don\u2019t need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.\nAbsent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran.\nThe first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. Breakout time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.\nAccording to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed.\nBecause Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short \u2014 about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s.\nAnd if \u2014 if Iran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.\nTrue, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Iran\u2019s adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here\u2019s the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don\u2019t stop them.\nInspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn\u2019t stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb.\nNow, we\u2019re warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100 nuclear</span> bombs.\nLike North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It\u2019s done that on at least three separate occasions \u2014<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2005,</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2006,</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010.</span> Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.\nNow, I know this is not gonna come a shock \u2014 as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.\nThe U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught \u2014 caught twice, not once, twice \u2014 operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn\u2019t even know existed.\nRight now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don\u2019t know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 20 years</span> that it doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that\u2019s why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.\nBut the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.\nNow, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs.\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 190,000 centrifuges</span></span>, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">not 6,000 or</span> even <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 19,000 that</span> Iran has today, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">but 10 times</span> that amount \u2014<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 190,000 centrifuges</span> enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision.\nMy long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.\nNow I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.\nAnd by the way, if Iran\u2019s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.\nSo you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That\u2019s why this deal is so bad. It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb; it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.\nSo why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse?\nWell, I disagree. I don\u2019t believe that Iran\u2019s radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 36 years</span>, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would whet appetite \u2014 would only whet Iran\u2019s appetite for more.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger?</span> If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it\u2019s under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism?\nWhy should Iran\u2019s radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world\u2019s: aggression abroad, prosperity at home?\nThis is a question that everyone asks in our region. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Israel\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Iran\u2019s neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it\u2019s been given a clear path to the bomb.\n</span>And many of these neighbors say they\u2019ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won\u2019t change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.\nThis deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.\nIf anyone thinks \u2014 if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we\u2019ll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.\nLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve come here today to tell you we don\u2019t have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don\u2019t have to gamble with our future and with our children\u2019s future.\nWe can insist that restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.(APPLAUSE)\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things.</span> First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSecond, stop supporting terrorism around the world.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you.\nIf the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIf Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn\u2019t change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIf Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)\nMy friends, what about the argument that there\u2019s no alternative to this deal, that Iran\u2019s nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?\nWell, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn\u2019t get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can\u2019t drive. A pilot without a plan can\u2019t fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can\u2019t make nuclear weapons.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">(APPLAUSE)\nIran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.\n</span>(APPLAUSE)\nNow, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table \u2014 and this often happens in a Persian bazaar \u2014 call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.\n(APPLAUSE)\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.\n</span>My friends, for over a year, we\u2019ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow we\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That\u2019s just not true.\nThe alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.\n(APPLAUSE)\nA better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.\n(APPLAUSE)\nA better deal that won\u2019t give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... no country has a greater stake \u2014 no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.\nLadies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths. One path leads to a bad deal that will at best curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war.\nThe second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal, that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity.\nYou don\u2019t have to read Robert Frost to know. You have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East and the peace of the world, the peace, we all desire.\n(APPLAUSE)\nMy friend, standing up to Iran is not easy. Standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is. With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel.(APPLAUSE)\nElie, your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words, \u201cnever again.\u201d\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNot to sacrifice the future for the present; not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace.\nBut I can guarantee you this, the days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over.(APPLAUSE)\nWe are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves. We restored our sovereignty in our ancient home. And the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 100 generations</span>, we, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThis is why \u2014 this is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI know that you stand with Israel.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou stand with Israel, because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history\u2019s horrors.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFacing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking all of us in this (inaudible) chamber is the image of Moses. Moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the Promised Land.\nAnd before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. I leave you with his message today, (SPEAKING IN HEBREW), \u201cBe strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.\u201d\nMy friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.\nMay God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all.\nYou\u2019re wonderful.\nThank you, America. Thank you.\nThank you."}, "68959": {"id": "68959", "text": "<h3>Russia\u2019s economy contracts sharply as war and sanctions take hold.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Daily Business Briefing\nThe Russian economy contracted steeply in the second quarter as the country felt the brunt of the economic consequences of its war in Ukraine, in what experts believe to be the start of a yearslong downturn.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The economy <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shrank 4 percent</span> from April through June compared with a year earlier, the Russian statistics agency said on Friday.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">It is the first quarterly gross domestic product report to fully capture the change in the economy since the invasion of Ukraine in February.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">It was a sharp reversal from the first quarter, when the economy <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 3.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Western sanctions, which cut off Russia from about half of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $600 billion</span> emergency stash of foreign currency and gold reserves, imposed steep restrictions on dealings with Russian banks and cut access to American technology, prompting hundreds of major Western corporations to pull out of the country.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But even as imports to Russia dried up and financial transactions were blocked, forcing the country to default on its foreign debt, the Russian economy proved more resilient than some economists had initially expected, and the fall in G.D.P. reported on Friday was not as severe as some had expected in part because the country\u2019s coffers were flush with energy revenue as global prices rose.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s economic growth since annexation of Crimea\nYear-over-year change in quarterly G.D.P.\nAnalysts, though, say the economic toll will grow heavier as Western nations increasingly turn away from Russian oil and gas, critical sources of export revenue.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe thought it would be a deep dive this year and then even out,\u201d Laura Solanko, a senior adviser at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, said of the Russian economy.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Instead, there has been a milder economic decline, but it will continue into next year, putting the economy in a shallower recession for two years, she said.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Russia, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.5 trillion</span> economy before the war started, moved quickly in the days after the invasion to mitigate the impact of sanctions.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The central bank more than doubled the interest rate <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span>, severely restricted the flow of money out of the country, shut down stock trading on the Moscow Exchange and loosened regulations on banks so lending didn\u2019t seize up.</span> The government also increased social spending to support households and loans for businesses hurt by sanctions.\nThe measures blunted some of the sanctions\u2019 impact. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">And as the ruble rebounded, Russia\u2019s finances benefited from high oil prices.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cRussia withstood the initial sanction shock\u201d and \u201chas been relatively resilient so far,\u201d said Dmitry Dolgin, the chief economist covering Russia at the Dutch bank ING.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But, he noted, unless Russia manages to diversify its trade and finances, the economy will be weaker in the long term.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Retail trade declined <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span>, the statistics agency said, while wholesale business activity <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 15 percent</span>.\n</span>Michael S. Bernstam, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said the data released on Friday were in line with other reports from Russia. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">He, too, expects the economy to deteriorate in the second half of this year, and then again <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span>\n</span>As the war drags on, many countries and companies will look to permanently end relationships with Russia and its domestic companies. Businesses will have trouble getting replacement parts for Western-made machines, and software will need updates. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Russian companies will need to rearrange their supply chains as imports seize up.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The prospects for Russia\u2019s energy industry, central to the country\u2019s economy, are deteriorating.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The United States and Britain have already banned Russian oil imports, and the country\u2019s oil output will fall further early next year when the full impact of a European Union ban on imports comes into effect.</span> Russia would need to find customers for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 2.3 million</span> barrels of crude and oil products a day, which is <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 percent</span> of its average output <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022,</span> according to the International Energy Agency.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">So far countries including India, China and Turkey have absorbed some of the lost trade from Europe and the United States, but it\u2019s unclear how many new buyers can be found.\n</span>Reliance on Russian natural gas is also being reduced. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In the final week of June, total European Union gas imports from Russia were <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 65 percent</span> from a year earlier, according to a report by the European Central Bank.</span> Some of these declines were forced on Europe because Russia has been cutting its supplies of gas. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But European countries have ramped up efforts to find alternative sources and are, for example, quickly developing infrastructure for additional imports of liquefied natural gas.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The economy will suffer as the \u201cexhaustion of inventories of investment imports, enforcement of the E.U. oil embargo, higher financial pressure on households and their higher dependence on the state\u201d take their toll, while the ability of the central bank and government to provide monetary and fiscal support is limited, Mr. Dolgin of ING wrote.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, inflation in Russia soared as households scrambled for goods they expected to become scarce.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">In July, inflation was running more <span id=\"12\"

slowing down, and as a result the central bank has slashed interest rates <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8 percent</span>, lower than they were before the war.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Last month, the bank said that business activity had not slowed as much as expected, but that the economic environment \u201cremains challenging and continues to significantly constrain economic activity.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The bank forecast that the economy will <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shrink 4 percent</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6 percent</span> this year, much less than it originally expected right after the start of the war.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">That 6 percent</span> figure also matches the latest update from the International Monetary Fund.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The economy will have a deeper contraction next year and not return to growth <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2025,</span> the central bank said on Friday.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The bank forecast that inflation would <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 12 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 percent</span> by the end of the year.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">In coming months, supply chain issues will present challenges, as businesses constrained by sanctions try to alter their supply chains to replenish stockpiles of finished and raw goods.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russian economy is doing well at the moment,\u201d Ms. Solanko said.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">But the idea that sanctions and the departure of companies from Russia would cause the economy to rapidly collapse was never realistic.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cEconomies just don\u2019t vanish,\u201d she said.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 index</span>\nThe stock market is set to notch the year\u2019s best stretch of gains, as investors take comfort from early signals that inflation is slowing down and the economy is holding up.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 rose</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1.5 percent</span> on Friday, putting the index on course for its fourth consecutive positive week, a feat it hasn\u2019t achieved since October.</span> The index is now <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 15 percent</span> higher than its low point in June, though it remains more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> lower for the year.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">The rally stands in stark contrast to the first half of the year, when Wall Street suffered its worst start in half a century, as the war in Ukraine, soaring energy costs, rising interest rates and rapid inflation galvanized investors\u2019 fears about the health of the economy.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">In the past month, investors have welcomed data that showed cooling inflation, a robust labor market and resilient company earnings.</span> Having braced for the worst, improvements in the outlook are being met with relief.\n<span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Federal Reserve officials have suggested that their campaign of interest rate increases to tame inflation is not yet done.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">But some investors see recent economic data as grounds for the central bank to move less aggressively, easing worries that higher borrowing costs could push the economy into a severe downturn.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe peak of freaking out about inflation and interest rates is done and we are looking at something that is not quite as dramatic,\u201d Michael Purves, the founder and chief executive of Tallbacken Capital, said.\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The latest Consumer Price Index report, released on Wednesday, offered a moment of relief for Wall Street, as inflation slowed <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8.5 percent</span> for the year to July, down from <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 9.1 percent</span> pace in the previous month.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The data offered an early indication that the Fed\u2019s attempt to pull inflation down may be having an effect.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">What\u2019s more, data showing that in July the economy regained all the jobs lost in the pandemic, along with weeks of better-than-expected earnings reports from companies, have assuaged some concern among investors that higher rates, which increase costs for companies, could cut more deeply into corporate America.\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The CBOE Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d because it reflects a sense of investors\u2019 uncertainty over stock market moves, dipped below its long-term average <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 points</span> this week.</span> The Vix had stayed above that mark since April, so the lower reading could be a sign that investors\u2019 consternation about another lurch lower has subsided.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a succession of inflationary pressures begin to roll over,\u201d said Patrick Palfrey, a senior US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, adding that this is \u201cforcing\u201d investors to re-evaluate their trading positions.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Bankers said that retail investors have helped drive the rally.</span> Sharp rises in so-called meme stocks and an uptick in some cryptocurrencies also point to great participation by individual investors.\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe cornerstone of this is the labor market and it\u2019s rock solid,\u201d James Masserio, the co-head of equities for the Americas at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job then you are not buying meme stocks.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Experts also said that stock markets were primed to ratchet higher.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Investors had scaled back their bets on the market because of uncertainty.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">The volume of trading has also been low, with many big investors taking vacations through August.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">As a result, even small amounts of buying interest have helped to lift the market, with momentum building as other investors chased returns.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over $11 billion</span> flowed into funds that buy U.S. stocks in the week through Wednesday, according to EPFR Global, the most in eight weeks.\nBut some warned that just as quickly as markets have recovered, they could come unstuck. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">Short-term gains are not unusual during periods of protracted losses, known as bear market rallies.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">After the S&<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 peaked</span> in <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2007,</span> it slid <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 50 percent</span> to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2008 in</span> the aftermath of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse.</span> Then, the index rose by <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 24 percent</span> in a matter of weeks. But the sell-off was not over. <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 gave</span> up all of those gains in <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2009,</span> before bottoming out in March of that year.\n</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Mr. Masserio said that the Fed\u2019s task of lowering inflation back to its target <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 percent</span> was akin to turning an oil tanker around: slow and fraught with risk.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cFundamentally, what had built up in the system is a lot trickier than what we can fix in six months of a shift in monetary policy,\u201d he said, warning that the stock market\u2019s woes may not yet be over.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Stocks are higher because the inflation outlook has improved and the economic backdrop remains supportive.</span> While expectations are not as dour as they were, there are doubts about how long the rally can last.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">\u201cI am bullish on the market but I am still an anxious and nervous bull,\u201d said Mr. Purves.</span> \u201cWe are not out of the woods just yet.\u201d\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Five of China\u2019s biggest state-owned companies, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in market value, will delist from the New York Stock Exchange in coming weeks, the firms said in a flurry of filings on Friday.\n</span>Three of the world\u2019s biggest energy firms, PetroChina, Sinopec and Shanghai Petrochemical, said in separate statements that they would apply for a voluntary delisting of their American depositary shares. Two other state-owned giants, the insurer China Life and the aluminum producer Chalco, also said they would stop offering their shares in the United States, citing the administrative burden and costs related to maintaining the shares.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">The companies\u2019 share prices fell in early trading in New York on Friday, most by <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Together, the companies have a combined market valuation of more <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $300 billion</span>.\n</span>They made their announcements amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, and greater scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the United States since Congress passed legislation introducing stricter oversight of these firms <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span></span>\n<span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">American lawmakers have long complained that Chinese companies do not play by the same rules as other companies on U.S. stock exchanges.</span> Despite years of discussions, Beijing and Washington have failed to strike an agreement that would give American regulators access to fully inspect the audit papers of U.S.-listed Chinese businesses.\n<span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">A listing on Wall Street, with its deep investor base and liquid market, was once seen as a coveted position for China\u2019s biggest companies and an important step for those aspiring to go global.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">But tensions between China and the United States have spilled over into nearly every aspect of the relationship between the two countries, from defense to climate and finance.</span> A contentious trip last week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own, has further inflamed the relationship. Hours after her visit, Beijing halted talks on military coordination, climate change and other issues.\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s market regulator said the moves would not \u201cjeopardize\u201d fund-raising activities by the five firms, adding that they can choose from multiple markets.</span> The companies will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland China.\n<span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">\u201cThese companies have strictly complied with the rules and regulatory requirements of the U.S. capital market since their listing in the U.S. and made the delisting choice for their own business considerations,\u201d the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement on Friday.\n</span>All five companies were added to a list of Chinese firms that did not meet the auditing standards of U.S. regulators, outlined in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that was passed <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span></span>\nAlibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant listed in New York, is another firm that was recently added to the list of more <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 270 companies</span>. When news of its addition emerged this month, its U.S.-listed shares <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped 11 percent</span>. The company said last month that it would soon seek a primary listing in Hong Kong, a move that would allow more investors from mainland China to invest in it.\n<span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber, was among the first Chinese companies to announce plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange late last year, signaling the end of a multiyear, trillion-dollar love affair between China and Wall Street.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">The British economy contracted slightly in the second quarter, losing momentum as the country experiences a deepening cost-of-living crisis and economists predict that a recession will start later this year.\n</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">Gross domestic product <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 0.1 percent</span> in April to June compared with the previous quarter, when the economy <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 0.8 percent</span>, the Office for National Statistics reported on Friday.\n</span>The biggest drag on growth in the second quarter was a reduction in health services as pandemic measures, such as coronavirus testing and vaccine administering, declined. <span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">This was only partly offset by growth in consumer-facing services, such as travel agencies, restaurants and hotels, and spending related to the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">Britons are facing a bleak combination of stagnant or declining economic growth with one of the highest inflation rates among its rich-economy peers.</span> <span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">In June, inflation climbed <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 9.4 percent</span>, the highest <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 40 years</span>, but isn\u2019t expected to peak until it <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaches 13 percent</span> in October.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">The Bank of England, which has been steadily raising interest rates since December in an effort to restrain rapid price rises, predicted last week that the country would enter a recession at the end of the year and wouldn\u2019t exit it until the beginning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2024.</span>\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">High inflation is squeezing household budgets and is expected to lead to a sharp decline in consumer spending, normally a major driver of economic growth, while soaring energy prices also constrain businesses.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">Household incomes, adjusted for inflation and taxes, are predicted to fall sharply this year and next, in the worst decline in records dating back to the 1960s, the central bank said.\n</span>British households are bracing for unsettlingly high energy bills in particular. <span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">In October, when the government price cap is reset, it could <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 3,500 pounds</span> ($4,256) per year, three times the amount a year ago.</span> <span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">But the effects of high inflation can already be seen: In the second quarter, consumer spending, once adjusted for price increases, <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 0.2 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">Warnings about low growth and high inflation are ringing across the globe.</span> <span id=\"81\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund said late last month that the world might soon \u201cbe teetering on the edge of a global recession.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"82\" class=\"red\">The U.S. economy also shrank in the second quarter, after a decline in the first quarter, setting off a debate about whether the country was already in a recession.\n</span><span id=\"83\" class=\"red\">The lingering effects of the pandemic and the economic consequences of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are evident in the British economy.</span> <span id=\"84\" class=\"red\">In the second quarter, growth was dragged down by a decline in wholesale and retail business activities, with companies reporting that they were still hampered by supply chain disruptions and a drop in retail sales as people cut back on spending to cope with the rising cost of living.\n</span><span id=\"85\" class=\"red\">The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank in London, argues that the British economy is already in a recession.</span> This underscores the scale of the challenge facing the contenders to be the next prime minister, in a contest that concludes next month. <span id=\"86\" class=\"red\">Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, have clashed over the best approach to provide support for more households, through tax cuts or direct payments, as Britain\u2019s economic outlook turns gloomier.\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 President Yoon Suk-yeol on Friday pardoned Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of the Samsung conglomerate, who served prison time after being convicted of bribing one of Mr. Yoon\u2019s predecessors.\nMr. Lee was released on parole last August. The pardon gives him a free hand to run Samsung, because it ends what had been a five-year ban on his return to management. <span id=\"87\" class=\"red\">But many South Korean business analysts believe that Mr. Lee had continued to control his empire through loyal subordinates, though Samsung has never explicitly confirmed that.\n</span>Mr. Lee was one of <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 1,700 people</span> pardoned by Mr. Yoon on Friday; most had been convicted of white-collar crimes and traffic violations. South Korean presidents often issue mass pardons to mark major holidays, like National Liberation Day, which falls on Monday, when the pardons will take effect.\n<span id=\"88\" class=\"red\">\u201cI hope that this special pardon will become an occasion for the people to pull their strength together to help overcome the economic crisis,\u201d Mr. Yoon said during a cabinet meeting on Friday.</span> <span id=\"89\" class=\"red\">He said many small-business owners had been among those pardoned.\n</span><span id=\"90\" class=\"red\">Samsung is the most successful of the handful of family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, that helped make South Korea a global export powerhouse and still dominate the economy.</span> <span id=\"91\" class=\"red\">Its Samsung Electronics unit alone accounts for nearly one-sixth of the country\u2019s total exports.\n</span>Mr. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, was convicted of bribing Park Geun-hye, the president at the time, to obtain government support for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries. Ms. Park was impeached <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 over</span> that bribe and other corruption accusations, and eventually went to prison herself, before being pardoned and released in December.\nMr. Lee was in the midst of a two-and-a-half-year prison term when he was paroled last year. <span id=\"92\" class=\"red\">Another tycoon, the Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin. received a suspended prison sentence on charges related to Ms. Park, and was also pardoned on Friday by Mr. Yoon, who promised a business-friendly government as a presidential candidate this year.\n</span>Mr. Yoon, a former prosecutor, was a leading member of the investigative team whose work led to the conviction of Mr. Lee and Mr. Shin.\nIn South Korea, there is a long history of chaebol leaders who were convicted of graft-related crimes and later received presidential pardons, usually on the grounds that the country needed the leaders. Anticorruption activists have long argued that such pardons help to entrench corruption in South Korean politics.\nAn opposition lawmaker, Park Yong-jin, said on Friday that Mr. Yoon had confirmed the widely held belief that \u201cyou are free if you are rich, but guilty if poor.\u201d\n<span id=\"93\" class=\"red\">But business groups have tirelessly lobbied for such pardons, arguing that the economy benefits when chaebol leaders are free to run their empires.</span> Recent public surveys found that a majority of South Koreans supported a pardon for Mr. Lee. In recent days, Mr. Yoon\u2019s approval ratings have dipped <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 30 percent</span>, an unusually poor performance for a South Korean leader so early in office.\nThough Mr. Lee\u2019s title is vice chairman, he began running South Korea\u2019s biggest and most lucrative conglomerate <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 when</span> his father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung\u2019s chairman, was incapacitated by a heart attack. The elder Mr. Lee died <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span></span>\n\u201cI am sincerely grateful for this opportunity to make a fresh start,\u201d Mr. Lee said on Friday in a statement released through Samsung. <span id=\"94\" class=\"red\">\u201cI will respond to the people\u2019s expectations and the government\u2019s thoughtful consideration by contributing to the economy through continuous investment and job creation for young people.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"95\" class=\"red\">South Korea has faced mounting uncertainty over its economy and national security, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, the growing tensions between the United States and China over Taiwan and North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear weapons threat.\n</span><span id=\"96\" class=\"red\">South Korean news outlets said the pardon could encourage Mr. Lee to succeed his late father as chairman of Samsung and to deal more actively with challenges facing the company, at a time when the global chip industry is scrambling to address supply shortages caused in part by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"97\" class=\"red\">Samsung, a global leader in the chip industry, must also deal with American pressure on South Korea to join a United States-led semiconductor supply chain alliance and with growing competition from China, which is investing aggressively in its own semiconductor industry.\n</span>Mr. Lee\u2019s legal troubles are not over. <span id=\"98\" class=\"red\">He is on trial on separate criminal charges of stock price manipulation and unfair trading.</span> Mr. Lee has said he is innocent.\nRivian, a fledgling electric-vehicle manufacturer, said Thursday that it <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost $1.7 billion</span> in the second quarter.\nThe company said it was continuing to struggle to get enough components to ramp up production to higher levels, but it affirmed its expectation that it would <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">make 25,000 vehicles</span></span> by the end of the year.\n<span id=\"99\" class=\"red\">\u201cSupply chain continues to be the limiting factor of our production,\u201d the company said in a statement.</span> \u201cHowever, through close partnership with our suppliers we are making progress.\u201d\n<span id=\"100\" class=\"red\">Rivian said it <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">generated $364 million</span> in revenue from April to June, up <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $95 million</span> in the first three months of the year.</span> It also said it had customer reservations <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 98,000 vehicles</span> at the end of June.\nRivian said last month that it <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">produced 4,401 vehicles</span> in the second quarter and <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivered 4,467 to</span> customers.\nIn a conference call, Rivian\u2019s chief executive, R.J. Scaringe, said that the company was seeing improvement in component availability, and that it was optimistic it could increase output in the second half of the year.\n<span id=\"101\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe second quarter saw a number of challenges in terms of semiconductors as well as overall ramping in our supply base,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cAs we look out over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of confidence\u201d about accelerating production.\nThe company plans a second shift of production by the end of the third quarter and has started hiring workers for it, Mr. Scaringe said.\nRivian said it expected a full-year adjusted loss <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5.45 billion</span>, up from an earlier forecast <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $4.75 billion</span>. <span id=\"102\" class=\"red\">It attributed the increase to higher material and shipping costs stemming from inflation, and costs associated with increasing production.\n</span>Rivian was once viewed as \u201cthe next Tesla,\u201d an electric-vehicle maker poised to grow rapidly and unsettle century-old giants of the auto industry like Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen. It planned to make an electric pickup and sport utility vehicle \u2014 models that would set it apart from the minimalist electric cars that Tesla produces.\nThe company gained billions of dollars in backing from investors including Ford and Amazon, which announced it intended to <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 100,000 electric</span> delivery vans from Rivian.\n<span id=\"103\" class=\"red\">Rivian\u2019s initial public offering was the largest <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span> and within a few days its stock price soared.</span> <span id=\"104\" class=\"red\">For a time, the company\u2019s market value was greater than that of Ford and General Motors combined.\n</span>But difficulty in sourcing critical computer chips and manufacturing troubles at its plant in Normal, Ill., kept production far below what the company had hoped for. It has also struggled to build delivery vans for Amazon. <span id=\"105\" class=\"red\">Rivian\u2019s stock price plummeted, and investors remain concerned about the company\u2019s prospects.\n</span>Now, as production is climbing, it faces a tougher competitive landscape. <span id=\"106\" class=\"red\">Ford has started making an electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, which is likely to pass Rivian in sales by the end of the year.</span> <span id=\"107\" class=\"red\">Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai and several others have ramped up sales of electric S.U.V.s, and G.M. has said it will start selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and a pair of electric S.U.V.s next year.\n</span><span id=\"108\" class=\"red\">Buyers of some of Rivian\u2019s vehicles are also expected to soon lose access to a federal tax credit under the climate bill that the House is expected to approve on Friday; the Senate passed it on Sunday.</span> <span id=\"109\" class=\"red\">Under the bill, purchases of vans, S.U.V.s and pickups that sell for more <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $80,000 will</span> not qualify for tax credits.</span> The credits will also not be available to individuals or couples who earn more <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 or</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $300,000 a</span> year.\n<span id=\"110\" class=\"red\">Rivian said last month that it was laying off <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 percent</span> of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 11,500 employees</span>.</span> <span id=\"111\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo fully realize our potential, our strategy must support our sustainable growth as we ramp towards profitability,\u201d Mr. Scaringe said in a letter to employees.</span> <span id=\"112\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need to be able to continue to grow and scale without additional financing in this macro environment.\u201d\n</span>An earlier version of this article and its summary misstated Rivian\u2019s production outlook for the full year. The company still expects to <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">make 25,000 vehicles</span></span>; it did not increase the forecast.\nFox News has selected its chief legal correspondent and late-night news anchor, Shannon Bream, to be the host of its signature political talk show, \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d elevating a woman to the role for the first time in the program\u2019s 26-year history.\n<span id=\"113\" class=\"red\">The job has been vacant since late last year, when Chris Wallace suddenly left after growing increasingly unnerved by the reduction of down-the-middle political programming at the network.\n</span>The show is something of an island in the Fox media world. Unlike the provocative conservative commentary served up in prime time on the Fox News Channel by hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, the content on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d is more neutral, modeled after the traditional Sunday morning news programs based in Washington. Democratic lawmakers regularly sit for lengthy interviews on the program, even though many are reluctant to do so during the channel\u2019s weekday programming.\n\u201cFox News Sunday\u201d airs first on the Fox broadcast network and then later in the day on the cable news network.\nMs. Bream is known to Fox viewers for her reporting on legal issues and the Supreme Court and as the host of the midnight news program on Fox News, \u201cFox News @ Night.\u201d Initially, the program was broadcast <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 11 p</span>.m. before the network bumped it for a comedy show hosted by Greg Gutfeld, who is also a co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d a round-table talk show that skews to a conservative point of view. The move was part of a programming shift at Fox that left some of its news anchors and correspondents, including Mr. Wallace, feeling marginalized.\nMs. Bream is the latest of several women to be promoted to senior positions at Fox under its chief executive, Suzanne Scott, who was chosen to overhaul the network\u2019s toxic workplace culture in the aftermath of a series of high-profile sexual harassment lawsuits involving Roger Ailes, the network\u2019s founder. In recent years, Ms. Scott, who served as Fox News\u2019s head of programming before being named chief executive <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> has installed Martha MacCallum, Dana Perino, Harris Faulkner and Laura Ingraham as hosts.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Russia\u2019s economy contracts sharply as war and sanctions take hold.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Daily Business Briefing\nThe Russian economy contracted steeply in the second quarter as the country felt the brunt of the economic consequences of its war in Ukraine, in what experts believe to be the start of a yearslong downturn.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The economy <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shrank 4 percent</span> from April through June compared with a year earlier, the Russian statistics agency said on Friday.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">It is the first quarterly gross domestic product report to fully capture the change in the economy since the invasion of Ukraine in February.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">It was a sharp reversal from the first quarter, when the economy <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 3.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Western sanctions, which cut off Russia from about half of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $600 billion</span> emergency stash of foreign currency and gold reserves, imposed steep restrictions on dealings with Russian banks and cut access to American technology, prompting hundreds of major Western corporations to pull out of the country.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But even as imports to Russia dried up and financial transactions were blocked, forcing the country to default on its foreign debt, the Russian economy proved more resilient than some economists had initially expected, and the fall in G.D.P. reported on Friday was not as severe as some had expected in part because the country\u2019s coffers were flush with energy revenue as global prices rose.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s economic growth since annexation of Crimea\nYear-over-year change in quarterly G.D.P.\nAnalysts, though, say the economic toll will grow heavier as Western nations increasingly turn away from Russian oil and gas, critical sources of export revenue.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe thought it would be a deep dive this year and then even out,\u201d Laura Solanko, a senior adviser at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, said of the Russian economy.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Instead, there has been a milder economic decline, but it will continue into next year, putting the economy in a shallower recession for two years, she said.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Russia, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.5 trillion</span> economy before the war started, moved quickly in the days after the invasion to mitigate the impact of sanctions.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The central bank more than doubled the interest rate <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span>, severely restricted the flow of money out of the country, shut down stock trading on the Moscow Exchange and loosened regulations on banks so lending didn\u2019t seize up.</span> The government also increased social spending to support households and loans for businesses hurt by sanctions.\nThe measures blunted some of the sanctions\u2019 impact. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">And as the ruble rebounded, Russia\u2019s finances benefited from high oil prices.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cRussia withstood the initial sanction shock\u201d and \u201chas been relatively resilient so far,\u201d said Dmitry Dolgin, the chief economist covering Russia at the Dutch bank ING.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But, he noted, unless Russia manages to diversify its trade and finances, the economy will be weaker in the long term.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Retail trade declined <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span>, the statistics agency said, while wholesale business activity <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 15 percent</span>.\n</span>Michael S. Bernstam, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said the data released on Friday were in line with other reports from Russia. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">He, too, expects the economy to deteriorate in the second half of this year, and then again <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span>\n</span>As the war drags on, many countries and companies will look to permanently end relationships with Russia and its domestic companies. Businesses will have trouble getting replacement parts for Western-made machines, and software will need updates. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Russian companies will need to rearrange their supply chains as imports seize up.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The prospects for Russia\u2019s energy industry, central to the country\u2019s economy, are deteriorating.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The United States and Britain have already banned Russian oil imports, and the country\u2019s oil output will fall further early next year when the full impact of a European Union ban on imports comes into effect.</span> Russia would need to find customers for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 2.3 million</span> barrels of crude and oil products a day, which is <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 percent</span> of its average output <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022,</span> according to the International Energy Agency.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">So far countries including India, China and Turkey have absorbed some of the lost trade from Europe and the United States, but it\u2019s unclear how many new buyers can be found.\n</span>Reliance on Russian natural gas is also being reduced. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In the final week of June, total European Union gas imports from Russia were <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 65 percent</span> from a year earlier, according to a report by the European Central Bank.</span> Some of these declines were forced on Europe because Russia has been cutting its supplies of gas. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But European countries have ramped up efforts to find alternative sources and are, for example, quickly developing infrastructure for additional imports of liquefied natural gas.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The economy will suffer as the \u201cexhaustion of inventories of investment imports, enforcement of the E.U. oil embargo, higher financial pressure on households and their higher dependence on the state\u201d take their toll, while the ability of the central bank and government to provide monetary and fiscal support is limited, Mr. Dolgin of ING wrote.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, inflation in Russia soared as households scrambled for goods they expected to become scarce.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">In July, inflation was running more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 percent</span>, according to the Russian central bank.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Already, though, there are signs inflation is slowing down, and as a result the central bank has slashed interest rates <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8 percent</span>, lower than they were before the war.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Last month, the bank said that business activity had not slowed as much as expected, but that the economic environment \u201cremains challenging and continues to significantly constrain economic activity.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The bank forecast that the economy will <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shrink 4 percent</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6 percent</span> this year, much less than it originally expected right after the start of the war.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">That 6 percent</span> figure also matches the latest update from the International Monetary Fund.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The economy will have a deeper contraction next year and not return to growth <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2025,</span> the central bank said on Friday.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The bank forecast that inflation would <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 12 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 percent</span> by the end of the year.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">In coming months, supply chain issues will present challenges, as businesses constrained by sanctions try to alter their supply chains to replenish stockpiles of finished and raw goods.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russian economy is doing well at the moment,\u201d Ms. Solanko said.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">But the idea that sanctions and the departure of companies from Russia would cause the economy to rapidly collapse was never realistic.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cEconomies just don\u2019t vanish,\u201d she said.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 index</span>\nThe stock market is set to notch the year\u2019s best stretch of gains, as investors take comfort from early signals that inflation is slowing down and the economy is holding up.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 rose</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1.5 percent</span> on Friday, putting the index on course for its fourth consecutive positive week, a feat it hasn\u2019t achieved since October.</span> The index is now <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 15 percent</span> higher than its low point in June, though it remains more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> lower for the year.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">The rally stands in stark contrast to the first half of the year, when Wall Street suffered its worst start in half a century, as the war in Ukraine, soaring energy costs, rising interest rates and rapid inflation galvanized investors\u2019 fears about the health of the economy.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">In the past month, investors have welcomed data that showed cooling inflation, a robust labor market and resilient company earnings.</span> Having braced for the worst, improvements in the outlook are being met with relief.\n<span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Federal Reserve officials have suggested that their campaign of interest rate increases to tame inflation is not yet done.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">But some investors see recent economic data as grounds for the central bank to move less aggressively, easing worries that higher borrowing costs could push the economy into a severe downturn.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe peak of freaking out about inflation and interest rates is done and we are looking at something that is not quite as dramatic,\u201d Michael Purves, the founder and chief executive of Tallbacken Capital, said.\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The latest Consumer Price Index report, released on Wednesday, offered a moment of relief for Wall Street, as inflation slowed <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8.5 percent</span> for the year to July, down from <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 9.1 percent</span> pace in the previous month.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The data offered an early indication that the Fed\u2019s attempt to pull inflation down may be having an effect.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">What\u2019s more, data showing that in July the economy regained all the jobs lost in the pandemic, along with weeks of better-than-expected earnings reports from companies, have assuaged some concern among investors that higher rates, which increase costs for companies, could cut more deeply into corporate America.\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The CBOE Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d because it reflects a sense of investors\u2019 uncertainty over stock market moves, dipped below its long-term average <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 points</span> this week.</span> The Vix had stayed above that mark since April, so the lower reading could be a sign that investors\u2019 consternation about another lurch lower has subsided.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a succession of inflationary pressures begin to roll over,\u201d said Patrick Palfrey, a senior US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, adding that this is \u201cforcing\u201d investors to re-evaluate their trading positions.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Bankers said that retail investors have helped drive the rally.</span> Sharp rises in so-called meme stocks and an uptick in some cryptocurrencies also point to great participation by individual investors.\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe cornerstone of this is the labor market and it\u2019s rock solid,\u201d James Masserio, the co-head of equities for the Americas at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job then you are not buying meme stocks.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Experts also said that stock markets were primed to ratchet higher.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Investors had scaled back their bets on the market because of uncertainty.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">The volume of trading has also been low, with many big investors taking vacations through August.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">As a result, even small amounts of buying interest have helped to lift the market, with momentum building as other investors chased returns.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over $11 billion</span> flowed into funds that buy U.S. stocks in the week through Wednesday, according to EPFR Global, the most in eight weeks.\nBut some warned that just as quickly as markets have recovered, they could come unstuck. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">Short-term gains are not unusual during periods of protracted losses, known as bear market rallies.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">After the S&<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 peaked</span> in <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2007,</span> it slid <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 50 percent</span> to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2008 in</span> the aftermath of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse.</span> Then, the index rose by <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 24 percent</span> in a matter of weeks. But the sell-off was not over. <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 gave</span> up all of those gains in <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2009,</span> before bottoming out in March of that year.\n</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Mr. Masserio said that the Fed\u2019s task of lowering inflation back to its target <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 percent</span> was akin to turning an oil tanker around: slow and fraught with risk.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cFundamentally, what had built up in the system is a lot trickier than what we can fix in six months of a shift in monetary policy,\u201d he said, warning that the stock market\u2019s woes may not yet be over.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Stocks are higher because the inflation outlook has improved and the economic backdrop remains supportive.</span> While expectations are not as dour as they were, there are doubts about how long the rally can last.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">\u201cI am bullish on the market but I am still an anxious and nervous bull,\u201d said Mr. Purves.</span> \u201cWe are not out of the woods just yet.\u201d\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Five of China\u2019s biggest state-owned companies, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in market value, will delist from the New York Stock Exchange in coming weeks, the firms said in a flurry of filings on Friday.\n</span>Three of the world\u2019s biggest energy firms, PetroChina, Sinopec and Shanghai Petrochemical, said in separate statements that they would apply for a voluntary delisting of their American depositary shares. Two other state-owned giants, the insurer China Life and the aluminum producer Chalco, also said they would stop offering their shares in the United States, citing the administrative burden and costs related to maintaining the shares.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">The companies\u2019 share prices fell in early trading in New York on Friday, most by <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Together, the companies have a combined market valuation of more <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $300 billion</span>.\n</span>They made their announcements amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, and greater scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the United States since Congress passed legislation introducing stricter oversight of these firms <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span></span>\n<span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">American lawmakers have long complained that Chinese companies do not play by the same rules as other companies on U.S. stock exchanges.</span> Despite years of discussions, Beijing and Washington have failed to strike an agreement that would give American regulators access to fully inspect the audit papers of U.S.-listed Chinese businesses.\n<span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">A listing on Wall Street, with its deep investor base and liquid market, was once seen as a coveted position for China\u2019s biggest companies and an important step for those aspiring to go global.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">But tensions between China and the United States have spilled over into nearly every aspect of the relationship between the two countries, from defense to climate and finance.</span> A contentious trip last week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own, has further inflamed the relationship. Hours after her visit, Beijing halted talks on military coordination, climate change and other issues.\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s market regulator said the moves would not \u201cjeopardize\u201d fund-raising activities by the five firms, adding that they can choose from multiple markets.</span> The companies will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland China.\n<span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">\u201cThese companies have strictly complied with the rules and regulatory requirements of the U.S. capital market since their listing in the U.S. and made the delisting choice for their own business considerations,\u201d the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement on Friday.\n</span>All five companies were added to a list of Chinese firms that did not meet the auditing standards of U.S. regulators, outlined in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that was passed <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span></span></span>\nAlibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant listed in New York, is another firm that was recently added to the list of more <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 270 companies</span>. When news of its addition emerged this month, its U.S.-listed shares <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped 11 percent</span>. The company said last month that it would soon seek a primary listing in Hong Kong, a move that would allow more investors from mainland China to invest in it.\n<span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber, was among the first Chinese companies to announce plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange late last year, signaling the end of a multiyear, trillion-dollar love affair between China and Wall Street.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">The British economy contracted slightly in the second quarter, losing momentum as the country experiences a deepening cost-of-living crisis and economists predict that a recession will start later this year.\n</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">Gross domestic product <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 0.1 percent</span> in April to June compared with the previous quarter, when the economy <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 0.8 percent</span>, the Office for National Statistics reported on Friday.\n</span>The biggest drag on growth in the second quarter was a reduction in health services as pandemic measures, such as coronavirus testing and vaccine administering, declined. <span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">This was only partly offset by growth in consumer-facing services, such as travel agencies, restaurants and hotels, and spending related to the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">Britons are facing a bleak combination of stagnant or declining economic growth with one of the highest inflation rates among its rich-economy peers.</span> <span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">In June, inflation climbed <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 9.4 percent</span>, the highest <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 40 years</span>, but isn\u2019t expected to peak until it <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaches 13 percent</span> in October.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">The Bank of England, which has been steadily raising interest rates since December in an effort to restrain rapid price rises, predicted last week that the country would enter a recession at the end of the year and wouldn\u2019t exit it until the beginning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2024.</span>\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">High inflation is squeezing household budgets and is expected to lead to a sharp decline in consumer spending, normally a major driver of economic growth, while soaring energy prices also constrain businesses.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">Household incomes, adjusted for inflation and taxes, are predicted to fall sharply this year and next, in the worst decline in records dating back to the 1960s, the central bank said.\n</span>British households are bracing for unsettlingly high energy bills in particular. <span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">In October, when the government price cap is reset, it could <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 3,500 pounds</span> ($4,256) per year, three times the amount a year ago.</span> <span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">But the effects of high inflation can already be seen: In the second quarter, consumer spending, once adjusted for price increases, <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 0.2 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">Warnings about low growth and high inflation are ringing across the globe.</span> <span id=\"81\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund said late last month that the world might soon \u201cbe teetering on the edge of a global recession.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"82\" class=\"red\">The U.S. economy also shrank in the second quarter, after a decline in the first quarter, setting off a debate about whether the country was already in a recession.\n</span><span id=\"83\" class=\"red\">The lingering effects of the pandemic and the economic consequences of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are evident in the British economy.</span> <span id=\"84\" class=\"red\">In the second quarter, growth was dragged down by a decline in wholesale and retail business activities, with companies reporting that they were still hampered by supply chain disruptions and a drop in retail sales as people cut back on spending to cope with the rising cost of living.\n</span><span id=\"85\" class=\"red\">The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank in London, argues that the British economy is already in a recession.</span> This underscores the scale of the challenge facing the contenders to be the next prime minister, in a contest that concludes next month. <span id=\"86\" class=\"red\">Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, have clashed over the best approach to provide support for more households, through tax cuts or direct payments, as Britain\u2019s economic outlook turns gloomier.\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 President Yoon Suk-yeol on Friday pardoned Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of the Samsung conglomerate, who served prison time after being convicted of bribing one of Mr. Yoon\u2019s predecessors.\nMr. Lee was released on parole last August. The pardon gives him a free hand to run Samsung, because it ends what had been a five-year ban on his return to management. <span id=\"87\" class=\"red\">But many South Korean business analysts believe that Mr. Lee had continued to control his empire through loyal subordinates, though Samsung has never explicitly confirmed that.\n</span>Mr. Lee was one of <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 1,700 people</span> pardoned by Mr. Yoon on Friday; most had been convicted of white-collar crimes and traffic violations. South Korean presidents often issue mass pardons to mark major holidays, like National Liberation Day, which falls on Monday, when the pardons will take effect.\n<span id=\"88\" class=\"red\">\u201cI hope that this special pardon will become an occasion for the people to pull their strength together to help overcome the economic crisis,\u201d Mr. Yoon said during a cabinet meeting on Friday.</span> <span id=\"89\" class=\"red\">He said many small-business owners had been among those pardoned.\n</span><span id=\"90\" class=\"red\">Samsung is the most successful of the handful of family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, that helped make South Korea a global export powerhouse and still dominate the economy.</span> <span id=\"91\" class=\"red\">Its Samsung Electronics unit alone accounts for nearly one-sixth of the country\u2019s total exports.\n</span>Mr. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, was convicted of bribing Park Geun-hye, the president at the time, to obtain government support for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries. Ms. Park was impeached <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 over</span> that bribe and other corruption accusations, and eventually went to prison herself, before being pardoned and released in December.\nMr. Lee was in the midst of a two-and-a-half-year prison term when he was paroled last year. <span id=\"92\" class=\"red\">Another tycoon, the Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin. received a suspended prison sentence on charges related to Ms. Park, and was also pardoned on Friday by Mr. Yoon, who promised a business-friendly government as a presidential candidate this year.\n</span>Mr. Yoon, a former prosecutor, was a leading member of the investigative team whose work led to the conviction of Mr. Lee and Mr. Shin.\nIn South Korea, there is a long history of chaebol leaders who were convicted of graft-related crimes and later received presidential pardons, usually on the grounds that the country needed the leaders. Anticorruption activists have long argued that such pardons help to entrench corruption in South Korean politics.\nAn opposition lawmaker, Park Yong-jin, said on Friday that Mr. Yoon had confirmed the widely held belief that \u201cyou are free if you are rich, but guilty if poor.\u201d\n<span id=\"93\" class=\"red\">But business groups have tirelessly lobbied for such pardons, arguing that the economy benefits when chaebol leaders are free to run their empires.</span> Recent public surveys found that a majority of South Koreans supported a pardon for Mr. Lee. In recent days, Mr. Yoon\u2019s approval ratings have dipped <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 30 percent</span>, an unusually poor performance for a South Korean leader so early in office.\nThough Mr. Lee\u2019s title is vice chairman, he began running South Korea\u2019s biggest and most lucrative conglomerate <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 when</span> his father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung\u2019s chairman, was incapacitated by a heart attack.

Scaringe, said that the company was seeing improvement in component availability, and that it was optimistic it could increase output in the second half of the year.\n<span id=\"101\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe second quarter saw a number of challenges in terms of semiconductors as well as overall ramping in our supply base,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cAs we look out over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of confidence\u201d about accelerating production.\nThe company plans a second shift of production by the end of the third quarter and has started hiring workers for it, Mr. Scaringe said.\nRivian said it expected a full-year adjusted loss <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5.45 billion</span>, up from an earlier forecast <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $4.75 billion</span>. <span id=\"102\" class=\"red\">It attributed the increase to higher material and shipping costs stemming from inflation, and costs associated with increasing production.\n</span>Rivian was once viewed as \u201cthe next Tesla,\u201d an electric-vehicle maker poised to grow rapidly and unsettle century-old giants of the auto industry like Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen. It planned to make an electric pickup and sport utility vehicle \u2014 models that would set it apart from the minimalist electric cars that Tesla produces.\nThe company gained billions of dollars in backing from investors including Ford and Amazon, which announced it intended to <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 100,000 electric</span> delivery vans from Rivian.\n<span id=\"103\" class=\"red\">Rivian\u2019s initial public offering was the largest <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span> and within a few days its stock price soared.</span> <span id=\"104\" class=\"red\">For a time, the company\u2019s market value was greater than that of Ford and General Motors combined.\n</span>But difficulty in sourcing critical computer chips and manufacturing troubles at its plant in Normal, Ill., kept production far below what the company had hoped for. It has also struggled to build delivery vans for Amazon. <span id=\"105\" class=\"red\">Rivian\u2019s stock price plummeted, and investors remain concerned about the company\u2019s prospects.\n</span>Now, as production is climbing, it faces a tougher competitive landscape. <span id=\"106\" class=\"red\">Ford has started making an electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, which is likely to pass Rivian in sales by the end of the year.</span> <span id=\"107\" class=\"red\">Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai and several others have ramped up sales of electric S.U.V.s, and G.M. has said it will start selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and a pair of electric S.U.V.s next year.\n</span><span id=\"108\" class=\"red\">Buyers of some of Rivian\u2019s vehicles are also expected to soon lose access to a federal tax credit under the climate bill that the House is expected to approve on Friday; the Senate passed it on Sunday.</span> <span id=\"109\" class=\"red\">Under the bill, purchases of vans, S.U.V.s and pickups that sell for more <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $80,000 will</span> not qualify for tax credits.</span> The credits will also not be available to individuals or couples who earn more <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 or</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $300,000 a</span> year.\n<span id=\"110\" class=\"red\">Rivian said last month that it was laying off <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 percent</span> of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 11,500 employees</span>.</span> <span id=\"111\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo fully realize our potential, our strategy must support our sustainable growth as we ramp towards profitability,\u201d Mr. Scaringe said in a letter to employees.</span> <span id=\"112\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need to be able to continue to grow and scale without additional financing in this macro environment.\u201d\n</span>An earlier version of this article and its summary misstated Rivian\u2019s production outlook for the full year.

Unlike the provocative conservative commentary served up in prime time on the Fox News Channel by hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, the content on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d is more neutral, modeled after the traditional Sunday morning news programs based in Washington. Democratic lawmakers regularly sit for lengthy interviews on the program, even though many are reluctant to do so during the channel\u2019s weekday programming.\n\u201cFox News Sunday\u201d airs first on the Fox broadcast network and then later in the day on the cable news network.\nMs. Bream is known to Fox viewers for her reporting on legal issues and the Supreme Court and as the host of the midnight news program on Fox News, \u201cFox News @ Night.\u201d Initially, the program was broadcast <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 11 p</span>.m. before the network bumped it for a comedy show hosted by Greg Gutfeld, who is also a co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d a round-table talk show that skews to a conservative point of view. The move was part of a programming shift at Fox that left some of its news anchors and correspondents, including Mr. Wallace, feeling marginalized.\nMs. Bream is the latest of several women to be promoted to senior positions at Fox under its chief executive, Suzanne Scott, who was chosen to overhaul the network\u2019s toxic workplace culture in the aftermath of a series of high-profile sexual harassment lawsuits involving Roger Ailes, the network\u2019s founder.

\u2018smear\u2019: How John Bolton became a target of the pro-Trump Internet</h3>The story quickly gained more <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 5,000 interactions</span> on Facebook \u2014 meaning shares, likes or other user actions \u2014 as it spread across pages and groups devoted to defending Trump. Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The attacks, which unfolded vividly in <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 24 hours</span> after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases \u2014 such as \u201cBook Deal Bolton\u201d \u2014 gained currency across the far-right firmament.</span> By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.\nThe vilification of Bolton \u2014 branding him as a traitor and member of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him \u2014 made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president\u2019s impeachment trial as a \u201cdisgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a \u201cRejected Neocon\u201d and the \u201cDeep State\u2019s Last Desperate Act.\u201d\n</span>That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories \u2014 which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency \u2014 remain fundamental to his hold on his base.\n\u201cIt only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of \u201cAmerican Conspiracy Theories.\u201d The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, \u201chitting back fairly strongly with a smear that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.\u201d\nThe path traveled by the \u201cDisobedient Media\u201d entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles.</span> The name of his blog, he said, was based on a \u201cjoke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.\u201d\nThe sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups \u2014 with a collective membership of more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 300,000.</span> One of them was a group called \u201cFox News Sean Hannity,\u201d described as a forum for \u201call Sean Hannity fans.\u201d The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group \u2014 which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host \u2014 for what they would hear when they tuned in that night.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton\u2019s boosters, either.\n</span>\u201cNow the Republicans don\u2019t like Bolton, so they\u2019ll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Democrats weren\u2019t getting something useful out of him, they wouldn\u2019t be fans either.\u201d\nEfforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, \u201cTurned his \u2018drug deal\u2019 into a book deal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Bolton\u2019s description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia.\nThe blogger, Craig Weide, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 16,000 followers</span>, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 74,000 within</span> about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called \u201cFOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,\u201d an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network.\nThe idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee\u2019s rapid response team. \u201cHow convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,\u201d wrote Steve Guest, the RNC\u2019s rapid-response director. \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\nJason Miller, a spokesman for Trump\u2019<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2016 campaign</span> and co-host of Stephen K.

Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The attacks, which unfolded vividly in <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 24 hours</span> after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases \u2014 such as \u201cBook Deal Bolton\u201d \u2014 gained currency across the far-right firmament.</span> By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.\nThe vilification of Bolton \u2014 branding him as a traitor and member of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him \u2014 made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president\u2019s impeachment trial as a \u201cdisgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a \u201cRejected Neocon\u201d and the \u201cDeep State\u2019s Last Desperate Act.\u201d\n</span>That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories \u2014 which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency \u2014 remain fundamental to his hold on his base.\n\u201cIt only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of \u201cAmerican Conspiracy Theories.\u201d The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, \u201chitting back fairly strongly with a smear that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.\u201d\nThe path traveled by the \u201cDisobedient Media\u201d entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles.</span> The name of his blog, he said, was based on a \u201cjoke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.\u201d\nThe sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups \u2014 with a collective membership of more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 300,000.</span> One of them was a group called \u201cFox News Sean Hannity,\u201d described as a forum for \u201call Sean Hannity fans.\u201d The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group \u2014 which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host \u2014 for what they would hear when they tuned in that night.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton\u2019s boosters, either.\n</span>\u201cNow the Republicans don\u2019t like Bolton, so they\u2019ll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Democrats weren\u2019t getting something useful out of him, they wouldn\u2019t be fans either.\u201d\nEfforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, \u201cTurned his \u2018drug deal\u2019 into a book deal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Bolton\u2019s description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia.\nThe blogger, Craig Weide, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 16,000 followers</span>, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 74,000 within</span> about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called \u201cFOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,\u201d an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network.\nThe idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee\u2019s rapid response team. \u201cHow convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,\u201d wrote Steve Guest, the RNC\u2019s rapid-response director. \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\nJason Miller, a spokesman for Trump\u2019<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2016 campaign</span> and co-host of Stephen K.

Yet he has often paid less in taxes than other recent presidents. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Barack Obama and George W. Bush each regularly paid more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $100,000 a</span> year \u2014 and sometimes much more \u2014 in federal income taxes while in office.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump, by contrast, is running a federal government to which he has contributed almost no income tax revenue in many years.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A large refund has been crucial to his tax avoidance.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump did face large tax bills after the initial success of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d television show, but he erased most of these tax payments through a refund.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Combined, Mr. Trump initially paid <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost $95 million</span> in federal income taxes over the<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 years</span>.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">He later managed to recoup most of that money, with interest, by applying for and receiving <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $72.9 million</span></span> tax refund, starting <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span>\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The refund reduced his total federal income tax bill <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2000 and</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017 to</span></span> an annual average <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.4 million</span>.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">By comparison, the average American in the <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top .001 percent</span> of earners paid <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $25 million</span> in federal income taxes each year over the same span.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $72.9 million</span> refund has since become the subject of a long-running battle with the I.R.S.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">When applying for the refund, he cited a giant financial loss that may be related to the failure of his Atlantic City casinos.</span> Publicly, he also claimed that he had fully surrendered his stake in the casinos.\nBut the real story may be different from the one he told. Federal law holds that investors can claim a total loss on an investment, as Mr. Trump did, only if they receive nothing in return. Mr. Trump did appear to receive something in return:<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 percent</span> of the new casino company that formed when he renounced his stake.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> the I.R.S. began an audit reviewing the legitimacy of the refund. Almost a decade later, the case remains unresolved, for unknown reasons, and could ultimately end up in federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Business expenses and personal benefits\nMr. Trump classifies much of the spending on his personal lifestyle as the cost of business.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">His residences are part of the family business, as are the golf courses where he spends so much time.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">He has classified the cost of his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his homes, as a business expense as well.</span> Haircuts \u2014 including more <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $70,000 to</span> style his hair during \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d \u2014 have fallen into the same category. So did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost $100,000 paid</span> to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">All of this helps to reduce Mr. Trump\u2019s tax bill further, because companies can write off business expenses.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Seven Springs, his estate in Westchester County, N.Y., typifies his aggressive definition of business expenses.\n</span>Mr. Trump bought the estate, which stretches over more <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 acres</span> in Bedford, N.Y., <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996.</span> His sons Eric and Donald Jr. spent summers living there when they were younger. \u201cThis is really our compound,\u201d Eric told Forbes <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014.</span> \u201cToday,\u201d the Trump Organization website continues to report, \u201cSeven Springs is used as a retreat for the Trump family.\u201d\nNonetheless, the elder Mr. Trump has classified the estate as an investment property, distinct from a personal residence. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">As a result, he has been able to write <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">off $2.2 million</span> in property taxes <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014 </span>\u2014 even as <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2017 tax</span> law has limited individuals to writing off <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $10,000 in</span> property taxes a year.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The \u2018consulting fees\u2019\nAcross nearly all of his projects, Mr. Trump\u2019s companies set aside <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 percent</span> of income for unexplained \u2018consulting fees.\u2019\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">These fees reduce taxes, because companies are able to write them off as a business expense, lowering the amount of final profit subject to tax.\n</span>Mr. Trump <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collected $5 million</span> on a hotel deal in Azerbaijan, for example, and <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported $1.1 million</span> in consulting fees. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">In Dubai, there was <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $630,000 fee</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $3 million</span> in income.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2010,</span> Mr. Trump has written off <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some $26 million</span> in such fees.\nHis daughter appears to have received some of these consulting fees, despite having been a top Trump Organization executive.\nThe Times investigation discovered a striking match: Mr. Trump\u2019s private records show that his company once <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paid $747,622 in</span> fees to an unnamed consultant for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia.

But they do offer the most detailed picture yet available.\nBelow is a deeper look at the takeaways. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The main article based on the investigation contains much more information, as does a timeline of the president\u2019s finances.</span> Dean Baquet, the executive editor, has written a note explaining why The Times is publishing these findings.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s tax avoidance\nMr. Trump has paid no federal income taxes for much of the past two decades.\n</span>In addition to <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 11 years</span> in which he paid no taxes during the<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 years</span> examined by The Times, he paid <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $750 in</span> each of the two most recent years \u2014<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 and</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017.</span>\nHe has managed to avoid taxes while enjoying the lifestyle of a billionaire \u2014 which he claims to be \u2014 while his companies cover the costs of what many would consider personal expenses.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">This tax avoidance sets him apart from most other affluent Americans.\n</span>Taxes on wealthy Americans have declined sharply over the past few decades, and many use loopholes to reduce their taxes below the statutory rates. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">But most affluent people still pay a lot of federal income tax.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span></span> the average federal income rate for the highest-<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning .001 percent</span> of tax filers \u2014 that is, the most affluent 1/100,000th slice of the population \u2014 <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 24.1 percent</span>, according to the I.R.S.\nOver the past two decades, Mr. Trump has paid <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $400 million</span> less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">His tax avoidance also sets him apart from past presidents.\n</span>Mr. Trump may be the wealthiest U.S. president in history. Yet he has often paid less in taxes than other recent presidents. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Barack Obama and George W. Bush each regularly paid more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $100,000 a</span> year \u2014 and sometimes much more \u2014 in federal income taxes while in office.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump, by contrast, is running a federal government to which he has contributed almost no income tax revenue in many years.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A large refund has been crucial to his tax avoidance.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump did face large tax bills after the initial success of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d television show, but he erased most of these tax payments through a refund.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Combined, Mr. Trump initially paid <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost $95 million</span> in federal income taxes over the<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 years</span>.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">He later managed to recoup most of that money, with interest, by applying for and receiving <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $72.9 million</span></span> tax refund, starting <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span>\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The refund reduced his total federal income tax bill <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2000 and</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017 to</span></span> an annual average <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.4 million</span>.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">By comparison, the average American in the <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top .001 percent</span> of earners paid <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $25 million</span> in federal income taxes each year over the same span.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $72.9 million</span> refund has since become the subject of a long-running battle with the I.R.S.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">When applying for the refund, he cited a giant financial loss that may be related to the failure of his Atlantic City casinos.</span> Publicly, he also claimed that he had fully surrendered his stake in the casinos.\nBut the real story may be different from the one he told. Federal law holds that investors can claim a total loss on an investment, as Mr. Trump did, only if they receive nothing in return. Mr. Trump did appear to receive something in return:<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 percent</span> of the new casino company that formed when he renounced his stake.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> the I.R.S. began an audit reviewing the legitimacy of the refund. Almost a decade later, the case remains unresolved, for unknown reasons, and could ultimately end up in federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Business expenses and personal benefits\nMr. Trump classifies much of the spending on his personal lifestyle as the cost of business.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">His residences are part of the family business, as are the golf courses where he spends so much time.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">He has classified the cost of his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his homes, as a business expense as well.</span> Haircuts \u2014 including more <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $70,000 to</span> style his hair during \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d \u2014 have fallen into the same category. So did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost $100,000 paid</span> to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">All of this helps to reduce Mr. Trump\u2019s tax bill further, because companies can write off business expenses.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Seven Springs, his estate in Westchester County, N.Y., typifies his aggressive definition of business expenses.\n</span>Mr. Trump bought the estate, which stretches over more <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 acres</span> in Bedford, N.Y., <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996.</span> His sons Eric and Donald Jr. spent summers living there when they were younger. \u201cThis is really our compound,\u201d Eric told Forbes <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014.</span> \u201cToday,\u201d the Trump Organization website continues to report, \u201cSeven Springs is used as a retreat for the Trump family.\u201d\nNonetheless, the elder Mr. Trump has classified the estate as an investment property, distinct from a personal residence. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">As a result, he has been able to write <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">off $2.2 million</span> in property taxes <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014 </span>\u2014 even as <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2017 tax</span> law has limited individuals to writing off <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $10,000 in</span> property taxes a year.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The \u2018consulting fees\u2019\nAcross nearly all of his projects, Mr. Trump\u2019s companies set aside <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 percent</span> of income for unexplained \u2018consulting fees.\u2019\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">These fees reduce taxes, because companies are able to write them off as a business expense, lowering the amount of final profit subject to tax.\n</span>Mr. Trump <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collected $5 million</span> on a hotel deal in Azerbaijan, for example, and <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported $1.1 million</span> in consulting fees. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">In Dubai, there was <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $630,000 fee</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $3 million</span> in income.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2010,</span> Mr. Trump has written off <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some $26 million</span> in such fees.\nHis daughter appears to have received some of these consulting fees, despite having been a top Trump Organization executive.\nThe Times investigation discovered a striking match: Mr. Trump\u2019s private records show that his company once <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paid $747,622 in</span> fees to an unnamed consultant for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia. Ivanka Trump\u2019s public disclosure forms \u2014 which she filed when joining the White House staff <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 show that she had received an identical amount through a consulting company she co-owned.\nMoney-losing businesses\nMany of the highest-profile Trump businesses lose large amounts of money.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2000,</span> he has reported losing more <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $315 million</span> at the golf courses that he often describes as the heart of his empire. Much of this has been at Trump National Doral, a resort near Miami that he bought <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> And his Washington hotel, opened <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> has lost more <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $55 million</span>.\nAn exception: Trump Tower in New York, which reliably earns him more <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $20 million</span> in profits a year.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The most successful part of the Trump business has been his personal brand.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The Times calculates that <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2004 and</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> Mr. Trump made a <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined $427.4 million</span> from selling his image \u2014 an image of unapologetic wealth through shrewd business management.</span> The marketing of this image has been a huge success, even if the underlying management of many of the operating Trump companies has not been.\nOther firms, especially in real estate, have paid for the right to use the Trump name.

displayed the social network\u2019s enormous financial clout on Thursday, even as the company has dealt with regulatory scrutiny and advertiser boycotts.\n</span><span id=\"2\"

percent</span></span> from a year earlier <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $18.7 billion</span>, while profit <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\"

billion</span> in revenue with a profit <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $3.9 billion</span>, according to data provided by FactSet.\nMore than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world.</span> And <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 2.47 billion</span> people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day.\nThe company said its number of monthly active users <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 12 percent</span> from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders around the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to be able to provide small businesses the tools they need to grow and be successful online during these challenging times,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who was grilled by lawmakers on Wednesday over Facebook\u2019s power. \u201cAnd we\u2019re proud that people can rely on our services to stay connected when they can\u2019t always be together in person.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Facebook\u2019s earnings have long been a bright spot for the Silicon Valley company.</span> Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, users have continued coming back to its services. Because of this, advertisers have consistently spent money on the platform.\nBut that started changing in late June when a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate For Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to pull back their spending because of issues of hate speech on the site. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Facebook has tried to assuage the concerns, but has made it clear that it will not change its policy about free speech on the site based on outside threats to the business.\n</span>Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The company warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could also eventually affect its bottom line.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon on Thursday reported record sales and profits in the latest quarter.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Amazon <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had $88.9 billion</span> in quarterly sales, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 40 percent</span> from a year earlier.</span> Profit doubled, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $5.2 billion</span></span>, even though the company invested heavily to improve the safety in Amazon\u2019s warehouses.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Analysts expected the company to <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have $81.4 billion</span> in sales <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $665 million</span> in profit, according estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Shares in the company jumped more <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6 percent</span> in after-hours trading.\n</span>\u201cSimply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The profit came even as Amazon <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invested $9 billion</span> in expanding warehouses and other capital expenditures to increase its capacity.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief, said on a call with reporters.\n</span>In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $4 billion</span> on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $300 million</span> for testing its work force for the virus.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d he said at the time.\nAmazon had been paying workers an <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $2 an</span> hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time \u201cthank you\u201d bonus <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $500 for</span> full-time associates in its warehouses.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 48 percent</span>.</span> As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cE-commerce is off the charts right now,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but \u201cdemand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,\u201d he said.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The number of products it sold <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 57 percent</span>, but the number of employees it had was up <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 34 percent</span>.\n</span>On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $2 billion</span> in the quarter.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 29 percent</span>, <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $10.8 billion</span>, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Alphabet said its revenue <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2 percent</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $38.3 billion</span> in the second quarter compared with a year ago.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 17 years</span> as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and profit.</span> Net profit <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $6.96 billion</span>, <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 30 percent</span> from a year ago.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Ford Motor said Thursday it <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earned $1.1 billion</span> in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost $1.9 billion</span> excluding interest and taxes.</span> The result was better than Ford\u2019s earlier forecast of a pretax loss <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5 billion</span>.\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost $758 million</span> in the second quarter.\nFord said in a statement that it expected \u201cno further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production\u201d in the second half of the year. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But the company also said it was not expecting \u201cmeaningful change in the current economic conditions.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The automaker forecast that it would <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earn $500 million</span> <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1.5 billion</span> on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services.\n</span>Ford\u2019s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 645,000 in</span> the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $954 million</span> setback in North America.\nThe company used <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $5.3 billion</span> in cash in the quarter, but said it still <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has $39 billion</span> on hand at the end of June.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Ford recorded a gain <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $3.5 billion</span> from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI.\nFrom April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed \u2014 and Apple made a <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">further $11.25 billion</span> in profits.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world\u2019s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Apple said its sales <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 11 percent</span></span> <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $59.7 billion</span> and its profits <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 12 percent</span> <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $11.25 billion</span>.</span> Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Revenue rose for all of Apple\u2019s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple\u2019s lofty standards.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices.</span> \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies\u2019 power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it.</span> \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Investors have flocked to Apple\u2019s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 percent</span> this year to a <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $1.67 trillion</span> value.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nEconomic output fell at its fastest pace on record last spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close their doors and kept millions of Americans shut in their homes for weeks.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of goods and services produced \u2014 <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 9.5 percent</span> in the second quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, G.D.P. fell at a rate <span id=\"82\"

unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Unlike past recessions, this one was a result of a conscious decision to suspend economic activity to slow the spread of the virus.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to sustain households and businesses, limit long-term damage and allow for a rapid rebound.\n</span>The plan worked at first. In recent weeks, however, cases have surged in much of the country. <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Data from public and private sources indicate a pullback in economic activity, reflecting consumer

Movies tend to make most of its box office dollars in the first two weekends, so the new terms appear to benefit the studio. In other words, there will be more reasons to stay home.\n<span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">United Airlines warned its pilots on Thursday that it may need to expand planned furloughs if demand for flights remains deeply depressed and a vaccine is not mass produced by the end of next year.</span> The airline previously said that it could furlough up to one third of its pilots, <span id=\"135\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 3,900 people</span>, this year and next. \u201cThat may not prove to be enough,\u201d an executive said in a memo to pilots.\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas on Thursday. <span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The company, which operates more <span id=\"136\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 locations</span> in the United States and internationally, said it will use the restructuring process to close unprofitable locations and cut debt, and plans to emerge from bankruptcy in under three months.</span> The company is the latest dining chain to file for <span id=\"137\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 11 protection</span> during the pandemic, following Chuck E.

Because of this, advertisers have consistently spent money on the platform.\nBut that started changing in late June when a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate For Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to pull back their spending because of issues of hate speech on the site. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Facebook has tried to assuage the concerns, but has made it clear that it will not change its policy about free speech on the site based on outside threats to the business.\n</span>Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The company warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could also eventually affect its bottom line.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon on Thursday reported record sales and profits in the latest quarter.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Amazon <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had $88.9 billion</span> in quarterly sales, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 40 percent</span> from a year earlier.</span> Profit doubled, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $5.2 billion</span></span>, even though the company invested heavily to improve the safety in Amazon\u2019s warehouses.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Analysts expected the company to <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have $81.4 billion</span> in sales <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $665 million</span> in profit, according estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Shares in the company jumped more <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6 percent</span> in after-hours trading.\n</span>\u201cSimply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The profit came even as Amazon <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invested $9 billion</span> in expanding warehouses and other capital expenditures to increase its capacity.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief, said on a call with reporters.\n</span>In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $4 billion</span> on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $300 million</span> for testing its work force for the virus.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d he said at the time.\nAmazon had been paying workers an <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $2 an</span> hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time \u201cthank you\u201d bonus <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $500 for</span> full-time associates in its warehouses.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 48 percent</span>.</span> As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cE-commerce is off the charts right now,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but \u201cdemand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,\u201d he said.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live.</span> Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The number of products it sold <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 57 percent</span>, but the number of employees it had was up <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 34 percent</span>.\n</span>On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $2 billion</span> in the quarter.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 29 percent</span>, <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $10.8 billion</span>, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Alphabet said its revenue <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2 percent</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $38.3 billion</span> in the second quarter compared with a year ago.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 17 years</span> as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and profit.</span> Net profit <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $6.96 billion</span>, <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 30 percent</span> from a year ago.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Ford Motor said Thursday it <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earned $1.1 billion</span> in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost $1.9 billion</span> excluding interest and taxes.</span> The result was better than Ford\u2019s earlier forecast of a pretax loss <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5 billion</span>.\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost $758 million</span> in the second quarter.\nFord said in a statement that it expected \u201cno further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production\u201d in the second half of the year. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But the company also said it was not expecting \u201cmeaningful change in the current economic conditions.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The automaker forecast that it would <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earn $500 million</span> <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1.5 billion</span> on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services.\n</span>Ford\u2019s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 645,000 in</span> the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $954 million</span> setback in North America.\nThe company used <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $5.3 billion</span> in cash in the quarter, but said it still <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has $39 billion</span> on hand at the end of June.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Ford recorded a gain <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $3.5 billion</span> from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI.\nFrom April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed \u2014 and Apple made a <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">further $11.25 billion</span> in profits.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world\u2019s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Apple said its sales <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 11 percent</span></span> <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $59.7 billion</span> and its profits <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 12 percent</span> <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $11.25 billion</span>.</span> Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Revenue rose for all of Apple\u2019s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple\u2019s lofty standards.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices.</span> \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies\u2019 power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it.</span> \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Investors have flocked to Apple\u2019s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 percent</span> this year to a <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $1.67 trillion</span> value.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nEconomic output fell at its fastest pace on record last spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close their doors and kept millions of Americans shut in their homes for weeks.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of goods and services produced \u2014 <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 9.5 percent</span> in the second quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, G.D.P. fell at a rate <span id=\"82\"

unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Unlike past recessions, this one was a result of a conscious decision to suspend economic activity to slow the spread of the virus.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to sustain households and businesses, limit long-term damage and allow for a rapid rebound.\n</span>The plan worked at first.

Team in Wuhan Says It\u2019s \u2018Extremely Unlikely\u2019 That Virus Came From Lab</h3>Covid-19 Live Updates: W.H.O. Team in Wuhan Says It\u2019s \u2018Extremely Unlikely\u2019 That Virus Came From Lab\nWorld Health Organization scientists who are tracing the pandemic\u2019s origin in China said the coronavirus had probably spread through an animal host.\nA team of World Health Organization scientists said on Tuesday in China that the coronavirus had probably first spread to humans through an animal and was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to have been the result of a lab accident.\nThe findings, delivered <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 12 days</span> of field work by the team visiting Wuhan, China, were the first step in a painstaking process to trace the pandemic\u2019s origins, a question that is critical to helping prevent a recurrence.\n\u201cAll the work that has been done on the virus and trying to identify its origin continue to point toward a natural reservoir,\u201d said Dr. Peter K. Ben Embarek, a food safety scientist with the W.H.O. who is leading the team of experts. He was speaking at a news conference in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first discovered late <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019.</span>\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Dr. Embarek dismissed the idea that the virus might have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, a theory that has gained currency among some officials and experts in the United States and elsewhere.</span> \u201cIt was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,\u201d he said, citing safety protocols.\nThe W.H.O. experts largely focused their comments on the scientific aspects of their mission, but the inquiry has been in many ways overshadowed by politics. The Chinese government has continued to suggest that the virus may have originated overseas, an idea that many scientists discount. Chinese officials on Tuesday used the news conference to promote this theory, arguing that the search for the virus\u2019s origin should focus on places outside China.\nThe investigation will \u201cnot be restricted to any location,\u201d said Liang Wannian, who led the team of Chinese scientists assisting in the W.H.O. mission.\nThe W.H.O. experts at the three-hour news conference did not challenge the statements by the Chinese officials. They pledged to examine reports of early cases of the virus outside China. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">They also called for more research into the animals that were sold at a sprawling market in Wuhan where some of the first cases of the virus were detected.\n</span>For the W.H.O., the visit also served as a chance to dispel criticism that it is too deferential to China.\nFor months, experts and politicians have denounced the W.H.O. for allowing the Chinese government to control the inquiry into the source of the pandemic. Chinese officials, wary of drawing attention to missteps during the outbreak, repeatedly delayed the visit by W.H.O. experts and sought to limit the scope of their mission. The Chinese government, acquiescing to growing global pressure, allowed the team <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14 scientists</span> into Wuhan last month.\nPeople with dementia have significantly greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, and are much more likely to be hospitalized and die from it, than people without dementia do, a new study of millions of medical records in the United States has found.\nTheir risk could not be entirely explained by characteristics common to people with dementia that are known risk factors for Covid-19: old age, living in a nursing home, and having conditions like obesity, asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. After researchers adjusted for those factors, Americans with dementia were still twice as likely to have gotten Covid-19 as of late last summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty convincing in suggesting that there\u2019s something about dementia that makes you more vulnerable,\u201d said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\nThe study found that Black people with dementia were nearly three times as likely as white people with dementia to become infected with the virus, a finding that experts said probably reflects the fact that people of color generally have been disproportionately harmed during the pandemic.\n\u201cThis study highlights the need to protect patients with dementia, especially those who are Black,\u201d the authors wrote.\nThe study was led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who analyzed electronic health records <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 61.9 million</span> people <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 18 and</span> older in the United States from Feb.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 through</span> Aug.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21,</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020.</span> The data, collected by IBM Watson Health Explorys, came <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 360 hospitals</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 317,000 health</span> care providers across <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and represented a fifth of the American population, the authors said.\nThe researchers found that out <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,770 patients</span> with Covid-19,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 810 of</span> them also had dementia. When the researchers adjusted for general demographic factors \u2014 age, sex and race \u2014 they found that people with dementia had more than three times the risk of getting Covid-19. When they adjusted for Covid-specific risk factors like nursing home residency and underlying physical conditions, the gap closed somewhat, but people with dementia were still twice as likely to become infected.\nExperts and the study authors said the reasons for this vulnerability might include cognitive and physiological factors.\n\u201cFolks with dementia are more dependent on those around them to do the safety stuff, to remember to wear a mask, to keep people away through social distancing,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study. \u201cThere is the cognitive impairment and the fact that they are more socially at risk.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nAs the European Union began its campaign to line up vaccines, it was slower off the mark, focused on prices while the United States and Britain made money no object, and succumbed to an abundance of regulatory caution.</span> All of those things have left the bloc flat-footed as drugmakers fall behind on their promised orders.\nBut <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 27 countries</span> of the European Union are also attempting something they have never tried before and have broken yet another barrier in their deeper integration \u2014 albeit shakily \u2014 by casting their lot together in the vaccine hunt.\nIn doing so, they have inverted the bloc\u2019s usual power equation. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Bigger, richer countries like Germany and France \u2014 which could have afforded to sign contracts directly with drugmakers, as the United States and Britain did \u2014 saw their vaccine campaigns delayed by the more cumbersome joint effort, while smaller countries wound up with better supply terms than they were likely to have negotiated on their own.\n</span>For the bulk of E.U. nations, that experiment has been beneficial. But it has not necessarily been greeted happily in the wealthiest countries, and it has left leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France open to criticism at home.\nThey and E.U. leaders have nonetheless stood by their decision and the impulse for solidarity, even as the finger-pointing has begun.\n\u201cWhat would people have said if Germany and France had been in competition with one another for the purchase or production of vaccines? That would have been chaos,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a news conference on Friday after a virtual meeting with Ms. Merkel. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat would have been counterproductive, economically and from a public health perspective, because we will only come out of this pandemic when we have vaccinated enough people in Europe.\u201d\n</span>But even as the leaders of Europe\u2019s traditional power duo talked up <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2.3 billion</span> doses ordered as an indication of the wisdom of a joint approach, they conceded that a full campaign could not be expected before March.\nJust <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 3 percent</span> of E.U. nationals had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of last week, compared <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 17 percent</span> in Britain <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 9 percent</span> in the United States.\nA million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine had been shipped recently to South Africa from India. The first injections were set for Wednesday. After weeks of rich countries vaccinating doctors and nurses against the coronavirus, a respite from the anxiety and the trauma seemed to be nearing in South Africa, too.\nThen, all of a sudden, the plans were shelved. The country\u2019s leaders on Sunday ordered the rollout of the vaccine halted after a clinical trial failed to show that it could prevent people from getting mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 caused by the coronavirus variant that has overrun the country.\nThe new findings from South Africa were far from conclusive: They came from a small clinical trial that enrolled fewer <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,000 people</span>. And they did not preclude what some scientists say is the likelihood that the vaccine protects against severe disease from the variant \u2014 a key indicator of whether the virus will overwhelm hospitals and kill people.\nBut even if the vaccine is shown to prevent severe disease, scientists say, what happened in South Africa is a warning to the world. As quickly as scientists developed vaccines, the virus has seemed to evolve even more quickly. Instead of eradicating the virus, scientists now foresee months, if not years, of vaccine makers continually having to update their booster shots to protect against new variants.\nAnd if the variant first seen in South Africa, now present <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 32 countries</span>, becomes the dominant form of the virus elsewhere, those countries could face a far slower crawl out of the pandemic.\nThe news was not all bad. Other vaccines offer some protection against the variant from South Africa, though less than against earlier versions of the virus. Among them is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine, which prevented hospitalizations and deaths in clinical trials in the country. Despite not yet being authorized there, it could be rolled out to some health workers by mid-February as part of what officials vaguely described as \u201ca research project.\u201d\nAstraZeneca is working to produce a version of its vaccine that can protect against the variant from South Africa by the fall.\nStill, the findings rattled scientists, undercutting the notion that vaccines alone will stop the spread of the virus anytime soon. And they led to new, and more urgent, demands that richer countries donate doses to poorer countries that could become breeding grounds for mutations if the virus spreads unchecked.\nA number of coronavirus variants are raising worries that they may draw out the pandemic or make vaccines less effective. Here are four that have been in the news lately and what we know about them.\nB.1.1.7\nFirst emerged in Britain.\nThought to be <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50 percent</span> more infectious than earlier versions.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that it is <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 35 percent</span> more deadly.\nCurrent vaccines appear to work well against it.\nThis variant has been detected in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 70 countries</span>, including the United States, where it is doubling roughly <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">every 10 days</span>. Experts predict that it could become the country\u2019s dominant source of infection by March. Learn more about B.1.1.7.\nB.1.351\nFirst identified in South Africa.\nVaccines may be less effective against it.\nSouth Africa halted its use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine on Sunday after evidence emerged that the vaccine did not protect against mild or moderate illness caused by B.1.351. The variant has spread to at <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 24 countries</span>, including the United States, where it has been detected in Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia.\nP.1\nFirst emerged in Brazil.\nMay be able to overcome immunity developed after infection by other variants.\nA close relative of B.1.351, this variant has spread to several countries, including the United States, where it has been detected in Minnesota and Oklahoma.\nCAL.20C\nFirst discovered in California.\nIt is not yet clear whether it is more infectious.\nThis variant was found in more than half of the coronavirus test samples that were screened in Los Angeles.\nFor more information and the latest news on these variants, check our tracker.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Jonathan Corum and\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats roll out a plan to <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">send $1,400 stimulus</span> payments to Americans earning up <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $75,000 a</span> year.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">House Democrats on Monday rolled out a main plank of President Biden\u2019s stimulus plan, proposing legislation to send direct payments <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1,400 to</span> Americans earning up <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $75,000 a</span>nd households with incomes up <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $150,000.</span>\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The plan, drafted the day before key committees are scheduled to begin meeting to consider it, is at odds with proposals from some Republicans and moderate Democrats who want to curtail eligibility for direct payments, targeting it to lower-income people.</span> Mr. Biden has said he is open to such modifications.\nFor now, the measure would allow individuals paid up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $100,000 and</span> households up <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $200,000 to</span> be eligible for some payment, though the size of the checks would phase out gradually for those with incomes <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $75,000,</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $150,000 for</span> a family.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The bill, unveiled by Representative Richard E.

But some had other ideas.\n\u201cWe identified a cluster of positive Covid-19 cases linked to students who did not follow the arrival shelter-in-place rules,\u201d a campuswide email reported on Jan.<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> blaming two student organizations for violating protocols. \u201cMore <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 students</span> are now in quarantine.\u201d\nThe foundation of most university plans for the spring semester centers on increased testing to identify infected students before they display symptoms, and then placing them in isolation.

The Bolivian police say that in January they <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">recovered 170 bodies</span> of people thought to have died from Covid-19, and health officials say intensive-care units are full.\n\u201c<span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">When 10 or</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 patients</span> die, their beds are full again in a few hours,\u201d said Carlos Hurtado, a public health epidemiologist in Santa Cruz, Bolivia\u2019s largest city.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The resurgence of the virus in Bolivia is part of a larger second wave throughout Latin America, where some of the world\u2019s strictest quarantine measures are giving way to pandemic fatigue and concerns about the economy.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund said on Monday that it was revising <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 2021 growth</span> forecast for Latin America and the Caribbean <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.1 percent</span> <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 3.6 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Warning that the surge in cases could threaten an economic recovery that is already expected to take longer than in other parts of the world, the fund predicted that regional output will not return to pre-pandemic levels <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2023.</span>\n</span>While the number of new cases is falling, deaths remain at near-record highs in many parts of the region, just as some governments begin vaccination efforts.\nBrazil and Mexico have each been averaging <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1,000 daily</span> Covid-19 deaths for weeks; their total pandemic death toll is now surpassed only by that of the United States. Deaths in Brazil have matched their summer peak, while in Mexico they are far higher than any earlier peak, though they have begun falling in recent days.\nIn Bolivia last summer, mortality figures reviewed by The New York Times suggested that the country\u2019s real death toll was nearly five times the official tally, indicating that Bolivia had suffered one of the world\u2019s worst epidemics. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 20,000 more</span> people died from June through August than in past years, according to a Times analysis \u2014 a vast number in a country of <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 million</span> people.\nBolivia is now reporting an average <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 60 coronavirus</span> deaths per day, approaching the numbers from last summer. Experts believe the higher mortality rate is caused by the more contagious virus variants originating in neighboring Brazil and elsewhere, but they lack the instruments to analyze the virus\u2019s genetic code.\nDespite the rising death rate, the Bolivian authorities have not implemented the quarantine measures used to help curb the virus\u2019s first wave a year ago.

Then he realized that he, too, had an urgent role to play: figuring out what to do with pandemic-generated detritus.\nThe paper, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, looked at how face masks could be combined with other recycled construction materials to reduce waste from the pandemic while reducing reliance on other materials like plastic, which is often used as filler in roads. The researchers found that about three million masks could be put into a two-lane road of more than half a mile, and that those roads were likely to be stronger and more flexible than some made with nonrecycled materials.\n\u201cThis research not only works, but it can also provide real engineering benefit,\u201d Dr. Saberian said, adding that he hoped the next step would involve building a prototype of the road to fully test its functionality.\nTo conduct their experiment, researchers heated the masks to simulate disinfecting them. They then shredded the masks into strips and mixed them with recycled concrete. Eventually, the researchers were left with hard cylindrical samples, which they tested by applying weight, heat and moisture.\nThe project is not the first to recycle materials into roads, nor is it the first to consider what to do with the masses of discarded personal protective equipment, the production of which has surged since last year. Companies such as TerraCycle, which collect personal protective equipment from homes and businesses, have also grown in popularity in recent months.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen spikes in single-used consumption all over the place, and this technology shows a path for using these materials,\u201d said Jonathan Krones, an industrial ecologist at Boston College who was not involved in the study.\nHe and other scientists said, however, that better solutions involved reducing consumption and the manufacturing of disposable materials, even in a pandemic. \u201cWhat I really want to see happening is us divorcing ourselves from this idea that disposability equals sanitation,\u201d Dr. Krones said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see people.\u201d\nThat was Naomi Osaka, the three-time Grand Slam champion, moments after her first-round win on Monday afternoon at the Australian Open.

Team in Wuhan Says It\u2019s \u2018Extremely Unlikely\u2019 That Virus Came From Lab</h3>Covid-19 Live Updates: W.H.O. Team in Wuhan Says It\u2019s \u2018Extremely Unlikely\u2019 That Virus Came From Lab\nWorld Health Organization scientists who are tracing the pandemic\u2019s origin in China said the coronavirus had probably spread through an animal host.\nA team of World Health Organization scientists said on Tuesday in China that the coronavirus had probably first spread to humans through an animal and was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to have been the result of a lab accident.\nThe findings, delivered <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 12 days</span> of field work by the team visiting Wuhan, China, were the first step in a painstaking process to trace the pandemic\u2019s origins, a question that is critical to helping prevent a recurrence.\n\u201cAll the work that has been done on the virus and trying to identify its origin continue to point toward a natural reservoir,\u201d said Dr. Peter K. Ben Embarek, a food safety scientist with the W.H.O. who is leading the team of experts. He was speaking at a news conference in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first discovered late <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019.</span>\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Dr. Embarek dismissed the idea that the virus might have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, a theory that has gained currency among some officials and experts in the United States and elsewhere.</span> \u201cIt was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,\u201d he said, citing safety protocols.\nThe W.H.O. experts largely focused their comments on the scientific aspects of their mission, but the inquiry has been in many ways overshadowed by politics. The Chinese government has continued to suggest that the virus may have originated overseas, an idea that many scientists discount. Chinese officials on Tuesday used the news conference to promote this theory, arguing that the search for the virus\u2019s origin should focus on places outside China.\nThe investigation will \u201cnot be restricted to any location,\u201d said Liang Wannian, who led the team of Chinese scientists assisting in the W.H.O. mission.\nThe W.H.O. experts at the three-hour news conference did not challenge the statements by the Chinese officials. They pledged to examine reports of early cases of the virus outside China. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">They also called for more research into the animals that were sold at a sprawling market in Wuhan where some of the first cases of the virus were detected.\n</span>For the W.H.O., the visit also served as a chance to dispel criticism that it is too deferential to China.\nFor months, experts and politicians have denounced the W.H.O. for allowing the Chinese government to control the inquiry into the source of the pandemic. Chinese officials, wary of drawing attention to missteps during the outbreak, repeatedly delayed the visit by W.H.O. experts and sought to limit the scope of their mission. The Chinese government, acquiescing to growing global pressure, allowed the team <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14 scientists</span> into Wuhan last month.\nPeople with dementia have significantly greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, and are much more likely to be hospitalized and die from it, than people without dementia do, a new study of millions of medical records in the United States has found.\nTheir risk could not be entirely explained by characteristics common to people with dementia that are known risk factors for Covid-19: old age, living in a nursing home, and having conditions like obesity, asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. After researchers adjusted for those factors, Americans with dementia were still twice as likely to have gotten Covid-19 as of late last summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty convincing in suggesting that there\u2019s something about dementia that makes you more vulnerable,\u201d said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\nThe study found that Black people with dementia were nearly three times as likely as white people with dementia to become infected with the virus, a finding that experts said probably reflects the fact that people of color generally have been disproportionately harmed during the pandemic.\n\u201cThis study highlights the need to protect patients with dementia, especially those who are Black,\u201d the authors wrote.\nThe study was led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who analyzed electronic health records <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 61.9 million</span> people <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 18 and</span> older in the United States from Feb.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 through</span> Aug.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21,</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020.</span> The data, collected by IBM Watson Health Explorys, came <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 360 hospitals</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 317,000 health</span> care providers across <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and represented a fifth of the American population, the authors said.\nThe researchers found that out <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,770 patients</span> with Covid-19,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 810 of</span> them also had dementia. When the researchers adjusted for general demographic factors \u2014 age, sex and race \u2014 they found that people with dementia had more than three times the risk of getting Covid-19. When they adjusted for Covid-specific risk factors like nursing home residency and underlying physical conditions, the gap closed somewhat, but people with dementia were still twice as likely to become infected.\nExperts and the study authors said the reasons for this vulnerability might include cognitive and physiological factors.\n\u201cFolks with dementia are more dependent on those around them to do the safety stuff, to remember to wear a mask, to keep people away through social distancing,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study. \u201cThere is the cognitive impairment and the fact that they are more socially at risk.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nAs the European Union began its campaign to line up vaccines, it was slower off the mark, focused on prices while the United States and Britain made money no object, and succumbed to an abundance of regulatory caution.</span> All of those things have left the bloc flat-footed as drugmakers fall behind on their promised orders.\nBut <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 27 countries</span> of the European Union are also attempting something they have never tried before and have broken yet another barrier in their deeper integration \u2014 albeit shakily \u2014 by casting their lot together in the vaccine hunt.\nIn doing so, they have inverted the bloc\u2019s usual power equation. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Bigger, richer countries like Germany and France \u2014 which could have afforded to sign contracts directly with drugmakers, as the United States and Britain did \u2014 saw their vaccine campaigns delayed by the more cumbersome joint effort, while smaller countries wound up with better supply terms than they were likely to have negotiated on their own.\n</span>For the bulk of E.U. nations, that experiment has been beneficial. But it has not necessarily been greeted happily in the wealthiest countries, and it has left leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France open to criticism at home.\nThey and E.U. leaders have nonetheless stood by their decision and the impulse for solidarity, even as the finger-pointing has begun.\n\u201cWhat would people have said if Germany and France had been in competition with one another for the purchase or production of vaccines? That would have been chaos,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a news conference on Friday after a virtual meeting with Ms. Merkel. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat would have been counterproductive, economically and from a public health perspective, because we will only come out of this pandemic when we have vaccinated enough people in Europe.\u201d\n</span>But even as the leaders of Europe\u2019s traditional power duo talked up <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2.3 billion</span> doses ordered as an indication of the wisdom of a joint approach, they conceded that a full campaign could not be expected before March.\nJust <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 3 percent</span> of E.U. nationals had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of last week, compared <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 17 percent</span> in Britain <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 9 percent</span> in the United States.\nA million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine had been shipped recently to South Africa from India. The first injections were set for Wednesday. After weeks of rich countries vaccinating doctors and nurses against the coronavirus, a respite from the anxiety and the trauma seemed to be nearing in South Africa, too.\nThen, all of a sudden, the plans were shelved. The country\u2019s leaders on Sunday ordered the rollout of the vaccine halted after a clinical trial failed to show that it could prevent people from getting mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 caused by the coronavirus variant that has overrun the country.\nThe new findings from South Africa were far from conclusive: They came from a small clinical trial that enrolled fewer <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,000 people</span>. And they did not preclude what some scientists say is the likelihood that the vaccine protects against severe disease from the variant \u2014 a key indicator of whether the virus will overwhelm hospitals and kill people.\nBut even if the vaccine is shown to prevent severe disease, scientists say, what happened in South Africa is a warning to the world. As quickly as scientists developed vaccines, the virus has seemed to evolve even more quickly. Instead of eradicating the virus, scientists now foresee months, if not years, of vaccine makers continually having to update their booster shots to protect against new variants.\nAnd if the variant first seen in South Africa, now present <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 32 countries</span>, becomes the dominant form of the virus elsewhere, those countries could face a far slower crawl out of the pandemic.\nThe news was not all bad. Other vaccines offer some protection against the variant from South Africa, though less than against earlier versions of the virus. Among them is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine, which prevented hospitalizations and deaths in clinical trials in the country. Despite not yet being authorized there, it could be rolled out to some health workers by mid-February as part of what officials vaguely described as \u201ca research project.\u201d\nAstraZeneca is working to produce a version of its vaccine that can protect against the variant from South Africa by the fall.\nStill, the findings rattled scientists, undercutting the notion that vaccines alone will stop the spread of the virus anytime soon. And they led to new, and more urgent, demands that richer countries donate doses to poorer countries that could become breeding grounds for mutations if the virus spreads unchecked.\nA number of coronavirus variants are raising worries that they may draw out the pandemic or make vaccines less effective. Here are four that have been in the news lately and what we know about them.\nB.1.1.7\nFirst emerged in Britain.\nThought to be <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50 percent</span> more infectious than earlier versions.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that it is <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 35 percent</span> more deadly.\nCurrent vaccines appear to work well against it.\nThis variant has been detected in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 70 countries</span>, including the United States, where it is doubling roughly <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">every 10 days</span>.

Learn more about B.1.1.7.\nB.1.351\nFirst identified in South Africa.\nVaccines may be less effective against it.\nSouth Africa halted its use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine on Sunday after evidence emerged that the vaccine did not protect against mild or moderate illness caused by B.1.351.

Officials in Bolivia and other Latin American nations are touting their nascent vaccination programs as a reason to avoid lockdowns, even though few countries in the region beyond Brazil have procured a meaningful number of doses.\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Only 20,000 vaccine</span> doses have arrived in Bolivia, although the government says it plans to vaccinate eight million people by September.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">In other global developments:\nMore cases linked to a quarantine hotel in Victoria, Australia, were reported on Tuesday as an employee and returned traveler both tested positive for the virus.</span> The traveler had completed her quarantine period, making her the second person this week to test positive after leaving a facility.\nStarting next week, travelers who return to Britain from countries where variants of the virus are widespread will have to <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pay 1,750 pounds</span> ($2,410) for a 10-day hotel quarantine, the authorities said on Tuesday. Those who lie about where they have been could face prison terms of up <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 years</span>, Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. The list of affected countries include Portugal, as well as most of South America and southern Africa.\nBritain\u2019s Defense Ministry said that a \u201cvery small number\u201d of its soldiers in Kenya had tested positive for the virus amid an outbreak at a training camp in the East African nation. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The camp, <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 120 miles</span> north of the capital, Nairobi, has <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 100 permanent</span> employees and rotating personnel <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 280,</span> according to the British military.</span> The base closed last year but reopened last month.\nAnatoly Kurmanaev, Mar\u00eda Silvia Trigo, Livia Albeck-Ripka, Elian Peltier and\nAdvertisement\nAn expansion of Alabama\u2019s lagging Covid-19 vaccination program drew large crowds of people on Monday as the state opened the last of eight new sites for inoculations.\nThe centers are a huge expansion of a vaccination program that has struggled to gain traction. <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Only 7.7 percent</span> of eligible Alabamians have gotten at least one vaccine dose, according to a New York Times database, placing the state last among <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 50 states</span> and the District of Columbia.\nLong lines of cars formed outside a downtown stadium in Selma, a hospital parking deck in Dothan and the site of a former shopping mall in Montgomery, where teams of workers delivered vaccinations through car windows. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Shots were available to anyone <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 65 and</span> to select groups that included educators, farm workers, grocery employees and state legislators.\n</span>Before the centers opened, only <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 medical</span> workers, emergency medical workers, nursing home residents and <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">people 75 and</span> over were eligible to be vaccinated. The opening of the eight centers coincided with an expansion of eligibility for vaccination that raised that total to about<span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span>5 million.\nEach of the eight centers is equipped to <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">give 5,000 vaccinations</span> by week\u2019s end. By comparison, workers at Southeast Health medical center in Dothan had vaccinated fewer <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 4,700 people</span> since vaccines first became available in late December, the hospital spokesman, Mark Stewart, said in an interview.\nMr. Stewart said thousands of applicants had already sought appointments in the Dothan area. <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 900 vaccinations</span> were to be given out by day\u2019s end, he said.\nSee How the Vaccine Rollout Is Going in Your State\nSee where doses have gone, and who is eligible for a shot in each state.\nAs the pandemic persists around the world, every month <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 130 billion</span> disposable face masks are ending up in landfills, city streets, rivers, beaches and oceans \u2014 posing a stark risk to the environmental.\nIn a study published last week, Australian researchers proposed a potential solution: recycling the used face masks into roads.\n\u201cAt the beginning of the pandemic, I wished I were a doctor,\u201d said Mohammad Saberian, a civil engineer at RMIT University who is the paper\u2019s lead author. Then he realized that he, too, had an urgent role to play: figuring out what to do with pandemic-generated detritus.\nThe paper, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, looked at how face masks could be combined with other recycled construction materials to reduce waste from the pandemic while reducing reliance on other materials like plastic, which is often used as filler in roads. The researchers found that about three million masks could be put into a two-lane road of more than half a mile, and that those roads were likely to be stronger and more flexible than some made with nonrecycled materials.\n\u201cThis research not only works, but it can also provide real engineering benefit,\u201d Dr. Saberian said, adding that he hoped the next step would involve building a prototype of the road to fully test its functionality.\nTo conduct their experiment, researchers heated the masks to simulate disinfecting them. They then shredded the masks into strips and mixed them with recycled concrete. Eventually, the researchers were left with hard cylindrical samples, which they tested by applying weight, heat and moisture.\nThe project is not the first to recycle materials into roads, nor is it the first to consider what to do with the masses of discarded personal protective equipment, the production of which has surged since last year. Companies such as TerraCycle, which collect personal protective equipment from homes and businesses, have also grown in popularity in recent months.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen spikes in single-used consumption all over the place, and this technology shows a path for using these materials,\u201d said Jonathan Krones, an industrial ecologist at Boston College who was not involved in the study.\nHe and other scientists said, however, that better solutions involved reducing consumption and the manufacturing of disposable materials, even in a pandemic. \u201cWhat I really want to see happening is us divorcing ourselves from this idea that disposability equals sanitation,\u201d Dr. Krones said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see people.\u201d\nThat was Naomi Osaka, the three-time Grand Slam champion, moments after her first-round win on Monday afternoon at the Australian Open. She stood at a microphone on the court at Rod Laver Arena and peered up at a crowd that seemed, if not normal, then something like it.\nThat was how it was on Monday across the grounds of Melbourne Park, where international sports returned, however temporarily, to something like it was before the pandemic.\nSpectators lined up for tickets. They waited in security lines, pondered whether to order burgers or fish and chips, and decided how <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">many $13 beers</span> they could stomach.\nThe tournament could safely occur now only because the Grand Slam tennis season happens to start in a country that has arguably controlled Covid-19 better than anywhere else, thanks to months of enforced lockdowns, closed borders, and thorough testing and contact tracing. <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Just 909 people</span> in Australia, which has a population of more <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 25 million</span>, have died of Covid-19.

the central bank could cut interest rates later this month.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Speaking during a second day of congressional testimony, Mr. Powell reiterated the Fed\u2019s intention to \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Although investors continue to disagree on how much the Fed will cut rates\u2014opinions vary on whether the central bank will slash by a quarter of a percentage point or half of one\u2014several said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments all but guarantee at least one rate cut as soon as this month.</span> And that supports continuing to hold sizable positions in U.S. stocks, some money managers said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cWith the Fed looking almost certain to cut rates in the coming weeks, it is important to position portfolios properly regardless of the outcome,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients on Thursday, recommending holding more stocks and cash over short-maturity U.S. government bonds.\n</span>Optimism around a rate cut helped push the Dow industrials on the last leg of its journey <span

Yellen, the Treasury secretary, will discuss imposing sanctions on Russia\u2019s gold reserves with a bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday, according to people with knowledge of the plans, as the United States and Europe prepare to level a new round of sanctions on Russian lawmakers this week.\n</span>The focus on gold reserves comes amid concerns that Russia is trying to utilize alternative assets to evade international sanctions and help prop up the ruble. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The United States and its Western allies have taken steps to cut Russia off from much of the global financial system by freezing its international currency reserves and imposing sanctions on several major financial institutions and oligarchs.\n</span>Ms. Yellen plans to discuss proposed legislation to target Russia\u2019s gold reserves with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, and Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cSecretary Yellen regularly meets with members of Congress to discuss legislation,\u201d said Morgan Finkelstein, a Treasury spokeswoman.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cAdditionally, Treasury staff frequently provide technical assistance on sanctions bills.\u201d\n</span>Plans for a meeting this week between Ms. Yellen and lawmakers were reported earlier by Axios.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Lawmakers have been working on a variety of bills that would tighten sanctions and restrict trade with Russia.</span> The Biden administration has broad authority to act alone on many of these measures, but Congress sometimes enacts legislation to pressure or force action from the White House.\nThe sanctions on gold reserves were proposed earlier this month and would block Russia from selling gold on international markets. The senators suggested that Russia\u2019<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $130 billion</span> worth of gold reserves were a loophole in the sanctions that were imposed on Russia\u2019s central bank. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">They said that Russia was laundering money through gold by buying and selling it for high-value currency.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Eswar Prasad, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, said that targeting gold would be another step in \u201ctightening the financial noose around Russia.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Gold sales are not specifically banned by the existing sanctions that are in place.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The lawmakers who drafted the legislation are seeking to understand why the Treasury Department appears to be reluctant to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s gold reserves, according to one of the people with knowledge of their thinking.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Treasury Department has not said that it is seeing Russia use gold to evade sanctions, though it has made clear that use of alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies would be a violation of U.S. law.\n</span>President Biden is expected to announce additional sanctions this week on hundreds of members of Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament and new measures to crack down on sanctions evasion during a series of global summits in Europe on Thursday.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Nestl\u00e9 said Wednesday that it was suspending sales of its KitKat and Nesquik brands in Russia, the latest effort from a global consumer giant to rethink operations there as the country wages war on Ukraine.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Global brand owners including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola have been under pressure to pull out of Russia as Western countries try to squeeze Russia\u2019s economy and thwart its ability to fund the war.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But these brands are balancing concerns, such as leaving behind investments in brands and factories, potentially disrupting complex supply chains and supporting sometimes sizable workforces.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Nestl\u00e9 said it was suspending sales of \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of its prewar volume of products in Russia, including pet food, coffee and candy.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It had already halted \u201cnonessential\u201d imports and exports into and out of Russia, alongside advertising and capital investment.</span> The company is also fully complying with all international sanctions on Russia, it said.\n\u201cWhile we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia, any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations,\u201d the company said Wednesday.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Nestl\u00e9 said its business in Russia would \u201cfocus on providing essential food\u201d to residents, like infant food and medical nutrition.</span> Other brands, like Danone and PepsiCo, have similarly said they would continue production of food and products deemed basic necessities. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Critics have said such moves undermine efforts to starve the Russian economy and pressured companies to make all-or-nothing breaks from Russia.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Maintaining even limited operations in Russia would make it easier for brands to restart broader business there, when or if they needed to.\n</span>Lawmakers in the United States, Britain and Ukraine have urged companies to cut ties, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has specifically pointed to Nestl\u00e9.\n\u201c\u2018Good food. Good life.\u2019 This is the slogan of Nestl\u00e9. Your company that refuses to leave Russia,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said on Saturday in a video message addressing antiwar protesters in Bern, Switzerland.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and their allies have shaken the Russian economy and caused the value of the ruble to plunge.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">On Wednesday President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came up with a way to get his opponents to help prop up his currency, by demanding that \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d use rubles to buy the Russian oil and gas that is still flowing.\n</span>\u201cI have made a decision to implement in the shortest possible time a set of measures to switch payments for \u2026 our natural gas supplied to the so-called unfriendly countries to Russian rubles,\u201d Mr. Putin said on Wednesday.\nSanctions aimed at the Russian central bank effectively froze hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The actions immediately drove down the value of the ruble as people frantically rushed to turn their rubles into a more stable currency, like the dollar or the euro.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The central bank took several steps to support the currency, including doubling interest rates <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span> as a way to entice people to keep their rubles in the bank.\n</span>That freeze, Mr. Putin said, was evidence that the dollar and euro \u201ccompromised themselves\u201d and were unreliable.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the action means that every time a Western country buys a barrel of oil it would be \u201cpropping up his domestic currency.\u201d\n</span>\u201cIf you\u2019re invoiced in rubles, you\u2019ve got to go out and buy rubles,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is workaround.\u201d\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">In Britain, the economic shock waves of the war in Ukraine are exacerbating a squeeze on household budgets and heightening fears of a cost of living crisis.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The British government on Wednesday announced some measures to help people cope with the rising prices, which are at their highest level in three decades, including cutting gas prices.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the sanctions on President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government and the efforts to isolate Russia were also weighing on the British economy.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">This was most acutely felt in the cost of living, he said.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe actions we have taken to sanction Putin\u2019s regime are not cost-free for us at home,\u201d Mr. Sunak told lawmakers as he announced an update to the Treasury\u2019s tax and budget plans on Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Hours earlier, the Office for National Statistics said inflation was at its highest level <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1992,</span> with prices rising <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 6.2 percent</span> from a year earlier.\n</span>The interventions announced on Wednesday were limited. For a year, the government will cut taxes on petrol and diesel <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 5 pence</span> a liter. (The rate had been frozen for more than a decade.) <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Local authorities will get <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another 500 million</span> pounds to support low-income households.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">And the biggest announcement of the day was the raise to the income threshold that workers must meet before they begin to pay National Insurance, a broad tax that funds state pensions and some benefits.\n</span>\u201cThe cut in fuel duty, though very welcome, is just a drop in the ocean compared to the larger tsunami of surging costs that is bearing down on firms and households,\u201d Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said in a statement.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent economic and fiscal forecasts for the government, downgraded its outlook for the economy.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Gross domestic product will <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increase 3.8 percent</span> this year <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1.8 percent</span> next year, it said on Wednesday.</span> Six months ago, the agency forecast a growth <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 6 percent</span> this year <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 2.1 percent</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Inflation will <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">average 7.4 percent</span> this year and won\u2019t fall back below the central bank\u2019s target <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 percent</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2024,</span> it said.\n</span>The outlook for household incomes was even bleaker. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">With inflation factored in, household disposable incomes per person will drop <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2.2 percent</span> in the next fiscal year beginning in April, the Office for Budget Responsibility said.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That would be the largest fall in a single financial year since official records began <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1956.</span>\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Despite the deteriorating economic outlook, Mr. Sunak seemed reluctant to deviate too far from his previous spending and tax plans.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">It was the Treasury\u2019s first fiscal announcement since Britain ended its pandemic restrictions, having already spent about \u00a3311 billion ($410 billion) in the first year of the pandemic on health services, businesses and workers.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">And Mr. Sunak has repeatedly stated the need to repair the public finances, temporarily raise some taxes and reduce government spending.\n</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The government was pushing ahead with a plan to raise National Insurance for employers and workers from next month, to ease the backlog at the National Health Service and fund adult social care.\n</span>Stellantis, maker of Chryslers and Jeeps, and LG will <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spend $4 billion</span> on a new battery factory in Ontario.\nStellantis and a partner, LG Energy Solution, said on Wednesday that they would jointly build a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, to provide the critical components for a range of electric Jeeps and trucks the automaker aims to introduce over the next several years.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">The two companies expect to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invest $4.1 billion</span> in the factory and <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">create 2,500 jobs</span>.</span> Stellantis, which was formed last year through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French automaker Peugeot, has long operated a minivan plant in Windsor.\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">The new factory is the latest in a series of plants auto manufacturers have said they will build in North America as they rush to produce electric cars and trucks and catch up to Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing market for electrics.</span> General Motors expects a battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, to start production this summer, and it is building a second one in Tennessee. Ford Motor has announced plans to build two battery plants in Kentucky and a third in Tennessee.

The vast majority of those losses stem from for-profit schools that have come under increasing scrutiny for their educational practices.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">When a college suddenly closes, stranded students can have their federal student loan debt forgiven through what\u2019s known as a closed-school discharge.</span> <span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Another relief program, called borrower defense to repayment, can eliminate the federal student loan debt of students who were significantly misled by their school\u2019s false claims.</span> In both cases, taxpayers are typically stuck paying the tab.\nThe department will require the new guarantees on a rolling basis, as schools sign or renew the agreements that let them receive federal student loan funds. <span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">It plans to demand them from private colleges and universities showing signs of potential distress and from those changing ownership.\n</span>A series of collapses at large for-profit chains have sent claims through both relief programs soaring in recent years. Last month, the Education Department approved borrower-defense claims for thousands of students who attended DeVry University \u2014 the first time it has granted claims at a still-operating school. <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">The department said it would try to recoup some of that cost \u2014 at <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $72 million</span>, with the bill likely to grow \u2014 from DeVry\u2019s current owner, which bought the long-troubled school <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n</span>The new policy does not guarantee that taxpayers will be repaid for future claims, however. Most investors or organizations that buy schools do so through holding companies, and if the institution implodes, the holding company is typically left with few assets.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2019,</span> for example, dozens of schools owned by Dream Center, a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education, collapsed barely a year after the organization bought them. While Dream Center is still operating, the entity that owned the schools \u2014 Dream Center Educations Holdings \u2014 is in receivership.\nBut the new rule also allows the Education Department to require companies with \u201csubstantial control\u201d over schools to sign these agreements. <span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">That could make investment companies, including some private equity firms that are active in the for-profit education market, responsible for the debt if their schools fail.\n</span>\u201cToo often the department has seen those who reap the rewards of colleges\u2019 actions when things go well leave us holding the bag when things go badly,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the head of the department\u2019s Federal Student Aid division. \u201cWe will be vigilant in our oversight and enforcement of this new policy.\u201d\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Strict state-aid rules that prevent European governments from subsidizing companies will be loosened, the European Union said on Wednesday, so that states can support businesses hit hard by the fallout of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions that have been imposed in response.\nThe European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, said that it had agreed on a \u201ctemporary crisis framework\u201d that would apply to state aid. The new temporary rules will allow member states to subsidize companies if they can show that they have suffered losses because of European sanctions against Russia, or Russian sanctions imposed in response to them.\n<span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Three kinds of aid will be permitted, the commission said in a statement: Governments will be allowed to give companies money; to extend credit lines so that companies stay financially healthy; and to directly compensate companies if they\u2019ve suffered \u201cadditional costs incurred due to exceptionally high gas and electricity prices,\u201d especially if they are so-called \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d businesses.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">The commission laid out details of how such state aid might work, including by capping it in certain cases, limiting how much money governments can provide for businesses that are affected by the war and its impact on energy prices, or more broadly.\n</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">The looser state-aid measures show that the European Union, which is normally very strict on restricting payments to companies and regularly fines governments for overstepping, is prepared to rewrite the rule book in view of the mounting economic costs that the broad E.U. sanctions on Russia are incurring at home.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">And while the new rules are described as \u201ctemporary,\u201d there is no specific timeline in the statement for a return to the normal way of doing business.\n</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">BRUSSELS \u2014 European Union countries are starting a fraught but urgent debate on how to immediately deal with booming energy prices and the prospect of fuel shortages, both linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as they attempt to cut remaining ties to Russia\u2019s economy.</span> The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled a set of options for E.U. leaders to look at during a meeting later in the week.\nThe bloc faces a dual energy crisis as its broad sanctions against Russia, along with sanctions from the United States and other Western allies, are failing to stop President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s plans for the war on Ukraine.\n<span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">Energy prices, already significantly higher this year because of the pandemic, are spiraling out of control, posing dire implications for European consumers and businesses.</span> <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">Energy costs are not only slowing down the bloc\u2019s postpandemic economic recovery but also fueling inflation, which is at a historic high, and further undermining growth.\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">And as the bloc contemplates how to urgently wean itself off Russian oil and gas \u2014 and prepares for the possibility that Russia might itself decide to cut or disrupt supply to Europe \u2014 E.U. countries are facing shortages for next winter.</span> How to fill that gap, and make their sanctions against Russia more effective, hinges on a complex joint operation of buying and storing fuels across the bloc.\n<span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">European Union leaders are set to discuss their options and possibly reach some early agreement in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, but the debate is acrimonious, as some countries want direct market interventions to subsidize consumers while others would prefer minimal tinkering with market dynamics.\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">The options paper presented by the European Commission on Wednesday included different ways of curbing energy prices for consumers and businesses, by intervening at the wholesale and retail levels through price caps, price subsidies and other types of interventions, including cutting tax costs for energy spending.\n</span>The paper also lays out ways in which the bloc can take a leap into jointly buying fuels and storing them communally. That would mean that the storage for oil, gas and liquefied natural gas in one E.U. state could also be used to save fuels for another member that didn\u2019t have sufficient storage capacity. <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">The goal of these options would be to fill up storage facilities immediately and guarantee sufficient supply for the entire European Union for next winter.\n</span>The commission proposal would mandate that member states fill <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 80 percent</span> of their underground storage facilities, which would require mass purchases in the immediate future, during the year\u2019s warmer months.\n<span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">All the options under consideration, the commission said in its options analysis, would cost E.U. governments money and probably distort global energy pricing and availability in the spring and summer, especially if E.U. leaders agree to make mass joint energy purchases immediately.\n</span>Today in the On Tech newsletter, Shira Ovide writes that unlike so many of our online experiences, shopping is one area that has remained mostly local.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Janet Yellen will discuss sanctions on Russian gold with lawmakers.</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Daily Business Briefing\nJanet L.

The vast majority of those losses stem from for-profit schools that have come under increasing scrutiny for their educational practices.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">When a college suddenly closes, stranded students can have their federal student loan debt forgiven through what\u2019s known as a closed-school discharge.</span> <span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Another relief program, called borrower defense to repayment, can eliminate the federal student loan debt of students who were significantly misled by their school\u2019s false claims.</span> In both cases, taxpayers are typically stuck paying the tab.\nThe department will require the new guarantees on a rolling basis, as schools sign or renew the agreements that let them receive federal student loan funds. <span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">It plans to demand them from private colleges and universities showing signs of potential distress and from those changing ownership.\n</span>A series of collapses at large for-profit chains have sent claims through both relief programs soaring in recent years. Last month, the Education Department approved borrower-defense claims for thousands of students who attended DeVry University \u2014 the first time it has granted claims at a still-operating school. <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">The department said it would try to recoup some of that cost \u2014 at <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $72 million</span>, with the bill likely to grow \u2014 from DeVry\u2019s current owner, which bought the long-troubled school <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n</span>The new policy does not guarantee that taxpayers will be repaid for future claims, however. Most investors or organizations that buy schools do so through holding companies, and if the institution implodes, the holding company is typically left with few assets.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2019,</span> for example, dozens of schools owned by Dream Center, a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education, collapsed barely a year after the organization bought them. While Dream Center is still operating, the entity that owned the schools \u2014 Dream Center Educations Holdings \u2014 is in receivership.\nBut the new rule also allows the Education Department to require companies with \u201csubstantial control\u201d over schools to sign these agreements. <span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">That could make investment companies, including some private equity firms that are active in the for-profit education market, responsible for the debt if their schools fail.\n</span>\u201cToo often the department has seen those who reap the rewards of colleges\u2019 actions when things go well leave us holding the bag when things go badly,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the head of the department\u2019s Federal Student Aid division. \u201cWe will be vigilant in our oversight and enforcement of this new policy.\u201d\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Strict state-aid rules that prevent European governments from subsidizing companies will be loosened, the European Union said on Wednesday, so that states can support businesses hit hard by the fallout of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions that have been imposed in response.\nThe European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, said that it had agreed on a \u201ctemporary crisis framework\u201d that would apply to state aid. The new temporary rules will allow member states to subsidize companies if they can show that they have suffered losses because of European sanctions against Russia, or Russian sanctions imposed in response to them.\n<span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Three kinds of aid will be permitted, the commission said in a statement: Governments will be allowed to give companies money; to extend credit lines so that companies stay financially healthy; and to directly compensate companies if they\u2019ve suffered \u201cadditional costs incurred due to exceptionally high gas and electricity prices,\u201d especially if they are so-called \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d businesses.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">The commission laid out details of how such state aid might work, including by capping it in certain cases, limiting how much money governments can provide for businesses that are affected by the war and its impact on energy prices, or more broadly.\n</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">The looser state-aid measures show that the European Union, which is normally very strict on restricting payments to companies and regularly fines governments for overstepping, is prepared to rewrite the rule book in view of the mounting economic costs that the broad E.U. sanctions on Russia are incurring at home.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">And while the new rules are described as \u201ctemporary,\u201d there is no specific timeline in the statement for a return to the normal way of doing business.\n</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">BRUSSELS \u2014 European Union countries are starting a fraught but urgent debate on how to immediately deal with booming energy prices and the prospect of fuel shortages, both linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as they attempt to cut remaining ties to Russia\u2019s economy.</span> The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled a set of options for E.U. leaders to look at during a meeting later in the week.\nThe bloc faces a dual energy crisis as its broad sanctions against Russia, along with sanctions from the United States and other Western allies, are failing to stop President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s plans for the war on Ukraine.\n<span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">Energy prices, already significantly higher this year because of the pandemic, are spiraling out of control, posing dire implications for European consumers and businesses.</span> <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">Energy costs are not only slowing down the bloc\u2019s postpandemic economic recovery but also fueling inflation, which is at a historic high, and further undermining growth.\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">And as the bloc contemplates how to urgently wean itself off Russian oil and gas \u2014 and prepares for the possibility that Russia might itself decide to cut or disrupt supply to Europe \u2014 E.U. countries are facing shortages for next winter.</span> How to fill that gap, and make their sanctions against Russia more effective, hinges on a complex joint operation of buying and storing fuels across the bloc.\n<span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">European Union leaders are set to discuss their options and possibly reach some early agreement in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, but the debate is acrimonious, as some countries want direct market interventions to subsidize consumers while others would prefer minimal tinkering with market dynamics.\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">The options paper presented by the European Commission on Wednesday included different ways of curbing energy prices for consumers and businesses, by intervening at the wholesale and retail levels through price caps, price subsidies and other types of interventions, including cutting tax costs for energy spending.\n</span>The paper also lays out ways in which the bloc can take a leap into jointly buying fuels and storing them communally. That would mean that the storage for oil, gas and liquefied natural gas in one E.U. state could also be used to save fuels for another member that didn\u2019t have sufficient storage capacity. <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">The goal of these options would be to fill up storage facilities immediately and guarantee sufficient supply for the entire European Union for next winter.\n</span>The commission proposal would mandate that member states fill <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 80 percent</span> of their underground storage facilities, which would require mass purchases in the immediate future, during the year\u2019s warmer months.\n<span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">All the options under consideration, the commission said in its options analysis, would cost E.U. governments money and probably distort global energy pricing and availability in the spring and summer, especially if E.U. leaders agree to make mass joint energy purchases immediately.\n</span>Today in the On Tech newsletter, Shira Ovide writes that unlike so many of our online experiences, shopping is one area that has remained mostly local."}, "76649": {"id": "76649", "text": "<h3>Biden just recited his wish list for struggling American families.

As part of a deal reached in May between United Airlines and its union, the Air Line Pilots Association, for example, vaccinations will not be mandatory for pilots. But a deal agreed to among Hollywood\u2019s major unions will allow studios to require everyone on a production set to be vaccinated.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you look at the divide of who is not vaccinated, it is people of lower income, it is people who are less likely to be insured, it is people in the states that reflect the politicization of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice dean for population health and health equity at the University of California, San Francisco.\n</span>Companies that adopt partial mandates that \u201cfurther widen\u201d that gap, she said, would \u201conly go so far\u201d in achieving what the vaccination drives were meant to accomplish.\nAdvertisement\nAs the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, Google and Apple have copied each other\u2019s smartphone software for years.

The Tensor chip will enable the phones to rapidly perform complex computing tasks, the company said.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system is by far the most widely used in the world, but its Pixel sales are dwarfed by those of Apple smartphones.</span> A major disadvantage for Google has been its approach to hardware: Because it relied on third parties for mobile chips, it couldn\u2019t make its phones as zippy as competitors that designed their chips in house.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> Apple acquired P.A.

In the last week, several have also imposed vaccine mandates, after having held off on such a step for months.\nThe decision to require vaccines was endorsed on Sunday by the director of the National Institutes of Health. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins said that asking employees for proof of vaccination or regular testing were steps \u201cin the right direction.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s how some big businesses changed their plans in late July:\nDelayed return to office:\nLyft pushed back its return-to-office date to February from September, Google extended its work-from-home policy to mid-October, and Apple said employees would not be expected to return to the office until at least Oct.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> a month later than before.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Uber said that it would not require employees to return until Oct.<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 25,</span> instead of its initial September date, and that a further delay was possible if cases kept rising.\n</span>Twitter shut its San Francisco and New York offices, putting a halt to reopening plans without a timeline in place.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The New York Times Company also indefinitely postponed its planned return to the office, telling employees that they would be given four weeks notice before being expected to return.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The company, which employs <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 4,700 people</span>, had planned for workers to start to return for at least three days a week in September.</span> Its offices will remain open for those who want to go in voluntarily, with proof of vaccination.\nEndeavor, the parent company of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, closed its recently reopened offices after Los Angeles County reimposed its indoor mask mandate. An Endeavor spokesman said the company had decided that enforcement would be too difficult and would hinder group meetings.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Vaccine requirements:\nEquinox, the luxury fitness company that includes SoulCycle, said on Monday that its members and employees must show one-time proof of vaccination \u2014 a physical immunization card, a photo of an immunization card or a digital vaccine card \u2014 to enter Equinox clubs, SoulCycle studios or corporate offices, starting in New York in September.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, with <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 1.6 million</span> workers, said vaccines would be mandatory for employees in its headquarters and for managers who traveled in the United States.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The mandate does not apply to much of its work force \u2014 employees in stores, clubs, and distribution and fulfillment centers.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The Walt Disney Company said salaried and nonunion hourly U.S. employees at its sites must be fully vaccinated.</span> Unvaccinated workers who are already on site will <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 60 days</span> to get the immunization, and new hires will be required to be fully vaccinated before starting work.\nMasks requirements:\nHome Depot said all its associates, contractors and vendors will be required to wear a mask in its stores, distribution centers and offices and at the homes and businesses of customers. Customers will also be asked to wear masks. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Lowe\u2019s also said it would require masks of its employees, regardless of vaccination status.\n</span>Walmart said it was reinstating mask requirements for associates in areas of the country with substantial or high transmission rates. The company recommended that customers wear masks in those areas, too. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The retailer also doubled its reward to employees who get vaccinated <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $75 to</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $150.</span>\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Starting Monday, the Florida-based grocery chain Publix will require employees to wear masks in all its stores regardless of their vaccination status.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Apple said employees and customers would have to wear masks regardless of their vaccination status in more than half its stores in the United States.</span> Apple said the stores would be determined by the rate of coronavirus cases in the area. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Apple also told its employees that they would have to wear masks when inside the company\u2019s main offices in the United States, regardless of whether they were vaccinated.\n</span>To understand work culture in China, start with a number:<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 996.</span>\nIt\u2019s shorthand for the grueling schedule that has become the norm at many Chinese firms:<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 a</span>.m. <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 9 p</span>.m., six days a week.\nThe term originated in the technology sector about five years ago, when the country\u2019s nascent internet companies were racing to compete with Silicon Valley. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">At first, workers were willing to trade their free time for overtime pay and the promise of helping China match the West.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s economy has grown into the second-largest in the world, after that of the United States.</span> Tech behemoths like Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are household names. But recently, more tech workers are resisting the at-all-costs culture, Vivian Wang writes for The Morning newsletter.\nSome in China\u2019s working class dismiss the complaints as elite griping; after all, tech workers are highly paid and educated. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">But the debate also offers a window into the country\u2019s economy more broadly, and the expectations of its young people.\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The first major pushback <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 996 came</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019,</span> as China\u2019s economic growth slowed and tech workers began questioning their work conditions.</span> Online protests followed, but the movement faded under government censorship.\nThis year,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 996 shot</span> back into the news after two workers died at Pinduoduo, an e-commerce giant.

Brisbane began a three-day lockdown on Saturday after six cases were discovered, and on Monday it was extended until Sunday.

As part of a deal reached in May between United Airlines and its union, the Air Line Pilots Association, for example, vaccinations will not be mandatory for pilots. But a deal agreed to among Hollywood\u2019s major unions will allow studios to require everyone on a production set to be vaccinated.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you look at the divide of who is not vaccinated, it is people of lower income, it is people who are less likely to be insured, it is people in the states that reflect the politicization of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice dean for population health and health equity at the University of California, San Francisco.\n</span>Companies that adopt partial mandates that \u201cfurther widen\u201d that gap, she said, would \u201conly go so far\u201d in achieving what the vaccination drives were meant to accomplish.\nAdvertisement\nAs the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, Google and Apple have copied each other\u2019s smartphone software for years.

Sky News subsequently retracted the segment and issued a correction.\nA last-minute lobbying push by the cryptocurrency industry to change language in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was finalized over the weekend succeeded in scaling back some of the scrutiny that participants in the sector will face from the I.R.S.\nThe final legislative text included some changes to alleviate concerns of the cryptocurrency industry, which expressed alarm last week about new requirements that would define most of the participants in the sector as brokers and force them to turn over information to the I.R.S. The provision was projected to <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raise $28 billion</span> over a decade.\nAfter receiving pushback from cryptocurrency lobbyists, lawmakers revised that section of the bill to \u201cclarify\u201d the definition of a broker rather than expand upon it.\nThe legislation also removed language that explicitly targeted \u201cany decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.\u201d It replaced that with a broader definition that characterizes brokers as anyone \u201cresponsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.\u201d\n<span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">The cryptocurrency industry has been adamant that the tougher tax enforcement should not apply to miners, or creators, of digital money, or the \u201cnode operators\u201d that keep the software behind transactions moving.\n</span>Lobbyists were continuing to press senators for greater clarity to ensure that those parts of the nascent sector would be excluded from the law. <span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">They believe that they have assurances from top lawmakers, such as Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, about the intent of the law, but they are still seeking similar assurances from the Treasury Department, which will have broad discretion to implement the law if it is passed and signed by President Biden.</span>"}, "32615": {"id": "32615", "text": "<h3>Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls</h3>Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B.

Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan.

The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive.

Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls</h3>Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.\nMr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s characterizations of the economy\u2019s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.\n</span>Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.\nA team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nThe United States is not \u201crounding the corner\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 53,120 cases</span> per day, an increase <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 23 percent</span> from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 20,000.</span>\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s kind of going back and forth <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 40 and</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,000 cases</span> a day,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI have said many times, and I\u2019ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The $1.5 trillion</span> tax cut, enacted in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2017,</span> ranks below at least half a dozen others by several metrics.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 1981 Reagan</span> tax cut is the largest as a percentage of the economy and by its reduction to federal revenue.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2012 Obama</span> cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars:<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $321 billion</span> a year.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nFalse.\nMr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly.\nIn the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested \u201cregularly.\u201d Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden\u2019s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.\n\u201cI have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nNot according to historians. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 2017 study</span> that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top.

Fifty thousand in another location, I think North Carolina. Five hundred thousand applications in Virginia. No, no, there is a tremendous problem.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nMr. Trump is cherry picking isolated incidents of errors in distributing absentee ballots and wrongly suggesting they are examples of widespread election fraud. Voter fraud, in all forms, is extremely rare, according to numerous independent studies and government reviews.\nIn August, a voting non-profit organization in Virginia accidentally <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sent 500,000 applications</span> with the wrong address on the return envelopes \u2014 not the ballots themselves. This week, an Ohio county determined that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50,000 voters</span> received an inaccurate absentee ballot this week. In a press release, the election board said that all affected voters would receive a corrected ballot.\nIt\u2019s unclear <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">what 50,000 ballots</span> in North Carolina he might have been referring to, but Mr. Trump has previously cited a mistake in Mecklenburg County, N.C. There, fewer <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500 voters</span> accidentally received two ballots. Election officials said the mistake was unlikely to lead to double voting, as the ballots contained specific codes for each individual voter.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou have Americans, bounties on American military\u2019s heads in Afghanistan.

While Mr. Trump ordered <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 3,000 more</span> to the country <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017,</span> they have since been drawn down to <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5,000.</span> Secretary of Defense Mark Esper recently announced that forces in Afghanistan will drop below that by the end of November and Mr. Trump\u2019s his national security adviser recently said on that the United States would cut its troops in Afghanistan <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 by</span> early next year.\n\u201cJust the other day they came out with a statement <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 85 percent</span> of the people that wear masks catch it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\nMr. Trump appears to be referring to a Sept.<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 report</span> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found dining out raised the risk of infection more than other social activities. The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">followed 314 people</span> who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 14 days</span> before the onset of illness,<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71 percent</span> of those who tested positive <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 74 percent</span> of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cHistorically Black colleges and universities, I got them funded, they were on a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business.\u201d\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is exaggerated.\nMr. Trump is taking outsized credit. Federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities ran out last September, a casualty of a broader fight in the Senate about education policy. In December, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise to restore that funding and made it permanent for a decade. Mr. Trump signed the legislation into law.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Mr. Trump did not request the increased funding that the schools have received recently. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The president <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">requested $643.9 million</span> in funding for H.B.C.U.\u2019s in <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2019 fiscal</span> year <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $626.3 million</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 </span>\u2014 which is less than <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $683 million</span> the schools received <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 </span>\u2014 but congressional appropriations <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped $700 million</span> in both years.\n</span>Advertisement\n\u201cYou <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 91 out</span> of the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> not paying a single solitary penny\u201d in corporate taxes.\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nTrue.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Data compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Progressive Policy, a liberal research organization in Washington, show <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 91 profitable</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> did not pay taxes on the income earned in the United States <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">That included companies that reduced their tax liability through deductions for investment, a key aim of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span>\n</span>\u2014 Mr. Trump\nFalse.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">But data show that the economy <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 failed</span> to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The expansion that stretched <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 through</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020 was</span> the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But many people remained on the job market\u2019s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades.</span> And inequality remained very high.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> protects <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 700,000 young</span> immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d named after legislation called the Dream Act.\nWhen Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span>\u2014 long before the coronavirus was discovered \u2014 that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017 and</span>, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">\u201cI managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of \u2014 the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar.</span> So, now, it\u2019s cheaper than coal, it\u2019s cheaper than oil right now.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly True.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained $90 billion</span> for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of energy production at the time to <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 9 percent</span> today.</span> In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople are leaving New York by the thousands, and you\u2019re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\nIt is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 110,000 people</span> on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2020.</span> It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.\n\u201cThe U.K. is up<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span>500 percent, the E.U. is <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 722 percent</span> and the United States is <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 21 percent</span>.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis is misleading.\nIt\u2019s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 128 percent</span> in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K.\nMr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.\n\u201cThere is no plan to figure out how to distribute it. How many \u2014 we <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 500,000,</span> you know, vials of it.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden\nMostly true.\nThe former vice president was referring to a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron. The distribution of Regeneron\u2019s treatment, which Mr. Trump received in the hospital this month and praised without evidence as a \u201ccure,\u201d has not been finalized by federal health officials. Regulators are also still examining clinical trial data to determine whether it is effective and which parts of the population might benefit the most from the treatment, which must be infused intravenously.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already started to prepare the outlines of a distribution plan, which leaves much of the decision-making on who gets the treatment to states. Through an agreement with the federal government, Regeneron\u2019s <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">first 300,000 doses</span> will go to the federal stockpile, where the products will then be distributed to the states, who will decide how they should be allocated.\nMr. Biden\u2019s claim that the company <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 500,000 vials</span> actually overstated it. Regeneron said it would only initially have enough doses <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 50,000 patients</span>, with the plan to have enough for <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 300,000 people</span> by the end of the year.\n\u201cI\u2019m very underleveraged. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared \u2014 in fact some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump\nThis lacks evidence.\n</span></span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has not released tax returns, but The New York Times has obtained several years of his returns, which show Mr. Trump carrying more <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span></span> in loans and other debt that he personally guaranteed and which will come due in the next four years.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">That debt load could be a problem for him in years to come, and possibly push him toward personal bankruptcy, especially given the coronavirus-related slowdown in the real estate and hospitality industries that comprise much of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.</span>"}, "3475": {"id": "3475", "text": "<h3>Family\u2019s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h3>ISTANBUL \u2014 When Alan Kurdi\u2019s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria\u2019s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.\nAs a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan\u2019s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.\nAn aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat. Dozens of other relatives \u2014 aunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.\nAnd just weeks after Alan\u2019s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.\n\u201cWe die together, or we live together and make a future,\u201d her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.\nAlan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria\u2019s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.\nSo when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.\nInterviews <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.\nSince Alan\u2019s death, at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.\nAlan\u2019s father, Abdullah, who <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat. He was trying to steer it in the chaos when it foundered in the waves.\nBut even for Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun, grieving her nephew, the calculus remained in favor of risking her children to save them. Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.\nKurdish Roots\nAlan\u2019s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.\n</span>They had six children. They remember living modest lives not much affected by tensions between the government and Kurds. They spent the summers harvesting olives in Kobani, but saw themselves as city kids. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Most left school after ninth grade to learn the family\u2019s barbering trade.\n</span>Fatima, the oldest daughter, was the first to emigrate. <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1992,</span> she moved to Canada to marry an Iraqi Kurd. They soon divorced, and she raised their son. Working nights in a printing plant, she caught the attention of a kindly boss.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Every night I\u2019ll teach <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">you 10 English</span> words,\u2019\u201d Fatima, known as Tima, recalled recently. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe rest I got from watching \u2018Barney\u2019 with my son.\u201d\nEnglish led to a hairstyling license, jobs at high-end salons and citizenship \u2014 successes that made the family\u2019s later journeys possible.\n</span>A commanding presence, Fatima became her siblings\u2019 source of advice, information and emergency cash. When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan\u2019s death a force for change.\nBut before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp \u2014 all places soon to be shattered by violence.\nDriven From Damascus\nThe ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.\nAs the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan\u2019s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family\u2019s Damascus barbershop.\nSome of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, \u201cI participated.\u201d\nThe government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.\n\u201cAfter the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,\u201d Abdullah recalled. \u201cAny simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.\u201d\nOne day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis\u2019 in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.\nNext, Alan\u2019s cousin Shergo,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.\nGovernment artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus \u2014 where an armed insurgency was taking shape \u2014 from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.\nThe Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan\u2019s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.\nThose two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.\nThe flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy\u2019s leg.\nAt the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.\n\u201cSo I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave,\u2019\u201d Shergo\u2019s mother, Ghousoun recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s better than if they take us.\u201d\nKobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Life on the Run\nAt first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds.

She was coming to see him, and the thought of it brightened him. He asked her for his sons\u2019 favorite stuffed dog, the one with the tongue sticking out, or maybe the Teletubby doll with the missing eye that he had promised to fix.\n\u201cI want something,\u201d he said, \u201cwith their smell.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Family\u2019s Tragedy Goes Beyond One Boy</h3>ISTANBUL \u2014 When Alan Kurdi\u2019s tiny body washed up on a beach in Turkey, forcing the world to grasp the pain of Syria\u2019s refugees, the 2-year-old boy was just one member of a family on the run, scattered by nearly five years of upheaval.\nAs a Turkish officer lifted the boy from the shallow waves at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, one of Alan\u2019s teenage cousins was alone on a bus in Hungary, fleeing the fighting back home in Damascus.\nAn aunt was stuck in Istanbul, nursing a baby, as her son and daughter worked 18-hour shifts in a sweatshop so the family could eat. Dozens of other relatives \u2014 aunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 had fled the war in Syria or were making plans to flee.\nAnd just weeks after Alan\u2019s image shocked the world in September, another aunt prepared to do what she had promised herself to avoid: set sail with four of her children on the same perilous journey.\n\u201cWe die together, or we live together and make a future,\u201d her 15-year-old daughter said, concluding, as have hundreds of thousands of other Syrians, that there was no going back, and that the way to security led through great risk.\nAlan, whose mother and brother drowned with him, belonged to a sprawling clan from Syria\u2019s long-oppressed Kurdish minority. But for most of his closest relatives, that identity was secondary to the cosmopolitan ethos of the Syrian capital, Damascus, where they grew up. They barely spoke Kurdish, identified mainly as Syrian and joined no faction.\nSo when war broke out, and political ties, sect and ethnicity became life-or-death matters, they were on their own.\nInterviews <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 20 relatives</span>, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in Istanbul, in five German towns and by phone in Syria, tell a story of a family chewed up by one party to the Syrian conflict after another: the Syrian government, the Islamic State, neighboring countries, the West.\nSince Alan\u2019s death, at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 100 more</span> children have drowned in the Mediterranean. A million refugees and migrants entered Europe this year, half of them Syrians, part of the biblical dispersion of a country where half the population has fled.\nAlan\u2019s father, Abdullah, who <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 39,</span> sometimes blames himself, wishing he could turn back time and not get on the boat. He was trying to steer it in the chaos when it foundered in the waves.\nBut even for Abdullah\u2019s sister Hivrun, grieving her nephew, the calculus remained in favor of risking her children to save them. Weeks after Alan died, she tried again to start for Germany. Once again, she and her children clambered onto a rubber raft.\nKurdish Roots\nAlan\u2019s grandfather was born in Kobani, a mostly Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border in the north. After compulsory army service, he moved to Damascus looking for work and settled in the mostly Kurdish neighborhood of Rukineddine, on the slopes of Mount Qasioun. He opened a barbershop and married a Kurdish woman who considered herself above all Damascene.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Rukineddine grew fast, with jumbled, unplanned housing and steep, narrow alleys cramming in poor rural workers, the kind of place where rebellion would later flare.\n</span>They had six children. They remember living modest lives not much affected by tensions between the government and Kurds. They spent the summers harvesting olives in Kobani, but saw themselves as city kids. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Most left school after ninth grade to learn the family\u2019s barbering trade.\n</span>Fatima, the oldest daughter, was the first to emigrate. <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1992,</span> she moved to Canada to marry an Iraqi Kurd. They soon divorced, and she raised their son. Working nights in a printing plant, she caught the attention of a kindly boss.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Every night I\u2019ll teach <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">you 10 English</span> words,\u2019\u201d Fatima, known as Tima, recalled recently. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe rest I got from watching \u2018Barney\u2019 with my son.\u201d\nEnglish led to a hairstyling license, jobs at high-end salons and citizenship \u2014 successes that made the family\u2019s later journeys possible.\n</span>A commanding presence, Fatima became her siblings\u2019 source of advice, information and emergency cash. When war broke out, she became their fiercest advocate, supplying the plans and means to seek asylum in the West and, later, the political savvy to make Alan\u2019s death a force for change.\nBut before the war, the rest of the Kurdis were not thinking of leaving Syria. They were putting down roots in the patchwork of communities that gave Syria its richness. They acquired in-laws and property in the Damascus suburbs, in Kobani and in the bustling Palestinian district of the Yarmouk refugee camp \u2014 all places soon to be shattered by violence.\nDriven From Damascus\nThe ripples of conflict reached the capital in the spring <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2011,</span> just as Abdullah Kurdi was starting a family with his wife, Rihanna, a cousin from Kobani.\nAs the protests, inspired by other Arab uprisings, began to spread against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Rihanna headed back to Kobani to give birth to Ghalib, Alan\u2019s older brother. Abdullah went back and forth, working in the family\u2019s Damascus barbershop.\nSome of the Kurdis sympathized with the initially peaceful demonstrations, but most avoided involvement. They feared going into details, since some relatives are still in Damascus. Abdullah said only, \u201cI participated.\u201d\nThe government cracked down across Syria, and the neighborhood quickly came under pressure. Security forces, always able to detain people at will, became jumpier, quicker to scapegoat Kurds or anyone without political connections.\n\u201cAfter the revolution started, I saw the differences between me and others, the racism,\u201d Abdullah recalled. \u201cAny simple policeman can accuse you. If someone writes a fake report against me, saying this Kurd did this or that, I will never come back.\u201d\nOne day, officers burst into the family home of some of the Kurdis\u2019 in-laws and dragged away two brothers, who had no known political involvement. They have not been heard from since.\nNext, Alan\u2019s cousin Shergo,<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span> saw a friend die, shot through the neck by the police while protesting outside school.\nGovernment artillery began shelling the restive suburbs of Damascus \u2014 where an armed insurgency was taking shape \u2014 from bases atop Mount Qasioun, up the slope from Rukineddine. The army guns were so close that the pressure of outgoing blasts cracked the wall of a family house.\nThe Kurdis were on the receiving end of the shelling, too, in the suburb of East Ghouta, where one of Alan\u2019s aunts lived with her family. Clashes also erupted in the Yarmouk camp, where another aunt lived with her Palestinian husband. He was wounded in shelling.\nThose two aunts brought their families home to Rukineddine. But it hardly felt safer.\nThe flight to Kobani came after Shergo and another teenage cousin witnessed a suicide bombing in the street. Flesh stuck to a wall, and shrapnel lodged in one boy\u2019s leg.\nAt the hospital, security officials questioned the boys, who were afraid to say what they had seen. The secret police started asking to talk to the Kurdi men.\n\u201cSo I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave,\u2019\u201d Shergo\u2019s mother, Ghousoun recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s better than if they take us.\u201d\nKobani seemed like a refuge then, as Kurds there tried to establish a safe semiautonomous zone. But, Abdullah lamented, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Life on the Run\nAt first, the problems were strictly economic.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Kobani offered few jobs.</span> Abdullah went to Istanbul to work, while his wife raised Ghalib, and later gave birth to Alan, sometimes spelled the Turkish way, Aylan. (Previous reports put his age <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3.</span>) Ghousoun and her family lived for a time in a sheep stable; she made money by bringing clothes from Damascus to sell.\n\u201cI suffered a lot, because I\u2019m a very neat person,\u201d Ghousoun recalled later, in her small and spotless Istanbul apartment.\nThen a new threat arose. The extremist Islamic State group split from others fighting Mr. Assad, declared a state, and preyed on Kurds and other minorities.\nGhousoun\u2019s travels grew perilous. Her accentless Arabic and conservative dress hid her Kurdishness at Islamic State checkpoints, but made her suspect at Kurdish roadblocks.\nBy <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2014,</span> the Islamic State was shelling Kobani. Word came that the militants would invade. Families fled toward Turkey, and some were caught between Islamic State fighters and the border fence.\nThere, fighters grabbed Ghousoun\u2019s husband, Mohammad, Abdullah\u2019s brother. They spoke Arabic, but their accent was not Syrian.\n\u201cThey beat and beat and beat him with a gun, my husband,\u201d Ghousoun said later, sobbing. \u201cIn front of me.\u201d Next, she said, they handed her son Shergo, by <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 15,</span> a gun.\n\u201cShoot your father,\u201d they told him.\n\u201cThey kept saying we were infidels,\u201d Ghousoun said. \u201cBut we are not.\u201d\nShe collapsed on the ground, calling on God, begging the fighters, and somehow, she said, \u201cthey took mercy.\u201d\nThe family spent days looking for a crossing, with hundreds of other Kurds. Finally, the group tried to breach the border. The Turkish police beat most of them back, but a Kurdish woman on the Turkish side hid Ghousoun\u2019s family in her cowshed.\nBack in Kobani, the Kurdi clan\u2019s olive groves were burned, houses destroyed, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18 relatives</span> slaughtered.\nMany of the survivors made it to Istanbul, and a new round of ordeals.\nA Way Station in Turkey\nAbdullah had managed to send money from Istanbul by working, and sleeping, in a clothing workshop.

Fund this week said global public debt is likely to approach a <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 100% of</span> output but urged policy makers to maintain spending to help vulnerable groups and promote a strong recovery.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The IMF said the global recession won\u2019t be as deep as it projected earlier, thanks in part to

virtually for the annual meetings of the fund and the World Bank.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">To cover the budget shortfall, the Treasury has sold a flood of new securities, boosting total

the<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $2.2 trillion</span> Cares Act in March\u2014helped keep households and businesses afloat during the early months of the downturn, boosting incomes and bolstering consumer demand.</span> With more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 million</span> people still out of work, however, there are signs that the recovery\u2019s momentum is slowing as federal aid programs expire.\nThere is little evidence the U.S. is approaching the limit of its ability to borrow. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Investors are eager to keep buying Treasury debt that is considered to be ultra-safe, holding interest rates near historic lows, and inflation has barely budged.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That has translated to lower debt-servicing costs for the government, which <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">declined 9% last</span> year from a year earlier, the Treasury said.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of alarming pressure from these deficits anywhere in our economy,\u201d said Wendy Edelberg, director of
