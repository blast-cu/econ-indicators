The Committee on the Present Danger, a long-defunct group that campaigned against the dangers of the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, has recently been revived with the help of Stephen K.

China\u2019s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country\u2019s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, in a bid to stabilize the markets.\n</span>The government-controlled Securities Association of China said <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.\n</span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf it\u2019s <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it\u2019s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China\u2019s fifth-largest bank.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> erasing more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $2 trillion</span> of value and inflicting immediate hardship on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The design of the brokerage industry\u2019s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government\u2019s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cExcessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China\u2019s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But the design of the securities industry\u2019s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Shares in large companies represent only <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">As Chinese stocks soared in <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> until their peak on <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> it was the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals that fared the best.</span> Many of them quadrupled, or more, in value, while the overall index only doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.\nThe small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Shanghai market <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">soared 149 percent</span> in the year until <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12.</span></span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">By comparison, a stock price index <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100 large</span> mainland Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong \u2014 and many of them in Shanghai as well \u2014 rose <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 24 percent</span> over the same period.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Official statistics suggest that loans to investors for stock purchases climbed ninefold in mainland China over the past two years, and were supplemented by widespread lending by informal financial companies at annual interest rates <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 20 percent</span>.\n</span>The bailout funds could also end up helping big state-owned enterprises at the expense of smaller businesses, which tend to be in the private sector. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have spoken of their desire to increase the role of the private sector as a way to improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets \u2014 the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Hours after the securities industry\u2019s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 25 mutual</span> fund companies, who announced plans to help shore up the stock market by speeding up the issuance of funds investing in equities.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">But the association did not introduce its own market stabilization fund like the brokerage industry, contrary to initial reports on Chinese social media that it would do so.\n</span>Another worry lies in whether many Chinese mutual funds and other investment funds may be required to liquidate suddenly. Many of these funds have rules on losses in the underlying contracts that formed them: If the value of the fund <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">falls 30 percent</span>, the fund must return the remaining money to shareholders, typically by cashing in all of its shares.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">With the Shanghai stock market <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 28.6 percent</span> since <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> that rule is starting to appear to be a possible risk to the broader market, Mr. Hong said.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 21 brokerages</span> said that they would not resume selling shares from their own portfolios until the Shanghai stock index returns <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4,500</span>; it closed on Friday <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3,686.915.</span>\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But Tao Zhigang, an economist who is the director of the Institute for China and Global Development at Hong Kong University, said that setting a specific target <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 4,500 ran</span> the risk that many investors may conclude the government will do whatever is necessary to push the market to that level.\n</span>That may prompt investors to borrow even more money on the conviction of a guaranteed return, he said.", "displayed_text":

Securities Association of China said <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.\n</span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf it\u2019s <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it\u2019s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China\u2019s fifth-largest bank.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> erasing more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $2 trillion</span> of value and inflicting immediate hardship on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The design of the brokerage industry\u2019s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government\u2019s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cExcessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China\u2019s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But the design of the securities industry\u2019s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Shares in large companies represent only <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">As Chinese stocks soared in <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> until their peak on <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> it was the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals that fared the best.</span> Many of them quadrupled, or more, in value, while the overall index only doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.\nThe small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Shanghai market <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">soared 149 percent</span> in the year until <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12.</span></span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">By comparison, a stock price index <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100 large</span> mainland Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong \u2014 and many of them in Shanghai as well \u2014 rose <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 24 percent</span> over the same period.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Official statistics suggest that loans to investors for stock purchases climbed ninefold in mainland China over the past two years, and were supplemented by widespread lending by informal financial companies at annual interest rates <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 20 percent</span>.\n</span>The bailout funds could also end up helping big state-owned enterprises at the expense of smaller businesses, which tend to be in the private sector. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have spoken of their desire to increase the role of the private sector as a way to improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets \u2014 the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Hours after the securities industry\u2019s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 25 mutual</span> fund companies, who announced plans to help shore up the stock market by speeding up the issuance of funds investing in equities.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">But the association did not introduce its own market stabilization fund like the brokerage industry, contrary to initial reports on Chinese social media that it would do so.\n</span>Another worry lies in whether many Chinese mutual funds and other investment funds may be required to liquidate suddenly. Many of these funds have rules on losses in the underlying contracts that formed them: If the value of the fund <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">falls 30 percent</span>, the fund must return the remaining money to shareholders, typically by cashing in all of its shares.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">With the Shanghai stock market <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 28.6 percent</span> since <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> that rule is starting to appear to be a possible risk to the broader market, Mr. Hong said.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 21 brokerages</span> said that they would not resume selling shares from their own portfolios until the Shanghai stock index returns <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4,500</span>; it closed on Friday <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3,686.915.</span>\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But Tao Zhigang, an economist who is the director of the Institute for China and Global Development at Hong Kong University, said that setting a specific target <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 4,500 ran</span> the risk that many investors may conclude the government will do whatever is necessary to push the market to that level.\n</span>That may prompt investors to borrow even more money on the conviction of a guaranteed return, he said."}, "17999": {"id": "17999", "text": "<h3>The U.S. traditionally leads in times of crisis.

It\u2019s so powerful and it\u2019s so traumatic. The emotions that it ignites today are going to be engraved in the national narrative.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an element of opportunism in some of the gestures by the United States\u2019 rivals. Huawei, the Chinese technology giant accused by the United States of acting as a branch of China\u2019s intelligence agencies, has seized the opportunity to promote its brand to stricken Europeans at a time when their governments are weighing whether to adopt its high-speed 5G cellular network, despite US requests not to do so.\nThe company has delivered thousands of masks and other equipment bearing the Huawei logo to hard-hit countries, which may help win support for its 5G network once the crisis subsides.\n\u201cChina is sending medical supplies, but it is it a good Samaritan or is it simply doing it to exploit tensions in the Western alliance?\u201d asked Braw. \u201cIt\u2019s very opportunistic and it\u2019s clear China senses a vacuum.\n\u201cBut unless the Trump administration ups its game, this could be the moment in world history where the trend pivots in favor of China,\u201d she added.\nRussia has likewise sensed opportunity in the vacuum of American leadership, sending a cargo plane of medical aid to Italy earlier this week. But Italian officials told Italian media that the offer was unsolicited and the equipment and medicine sent didn\u2019t match Italy\u2019s needs.\nU.S. officials say they have offered assistance. U.S. troops based in Italy helped send and deliver hospital beds, mattresses, stretchers and other equipment to the Italian province of Lombardy, the ground zero of Italy\u2019s coronavirus crisis.\nIn late January, when China\u2019s outbreak was at its peak, the U.S. government said it was sending more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 17 tons</span> of medical equipment there. In early February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $100 million</span> in assistance \u201cto China.\u201d\nThe State Department modified that in later statements, saying the aid would go to high-risk and developing countries, with no mention of China.

It is our resources, our expertise, our technical capacity and our standing in the world that allows us to do that.

And it presages fights between Congress, the White House and both parties over spending priorities, despite the one-party rule that gave some observers hope that the gridlock would cease.\nTrump weighed into the spending wars on Thursday morning, indicating it was Democrats who bore the blame for shutdown threats because the party was focused on \u201cbailing out insurance companies\u201d while the president wants to \u201crebuild our military and secure our border.\u201d\nBut it was Republicans who this week jettisoned Trump\u2019s top priority \u2014 money for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 because of widespread agreement that it should not be tied to the spending deal. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Trump has also agreed to pay the cost-sharing subsidies for low-income people who get their insurance under the ACA \u2014 something he threatened to withhold if he did not get money for the wall.\nRyan on Thursday also blamed Democrats for \u201cdragging their feet\u201d on negotiations in an apparent preparation to blame Democrats if their deal falls through.\n</span>\u201cI would be shocked if they would want to see a government shutdown, that the Democrats would want to do that,\u201d Ryan told reporters at his weekly press briefing. \u201cThe reason this government funding bill is not ready is because Democrats have been dragging their feet.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The standoff is the first in what could be several budget battles between Congress and the White House this year.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Trump has called for massive hikes to defense spending and harsh cuts to domestic agencies in <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2018 budget</span>, a proposal that many Republicans have rejected out of hand.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">He is also likely to revive calls for money to begin constructing the border wall \u2014 which by some estimates would cost as much <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $21 billion</span> \u2014 in future budget negotiations.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) were forced to negotiate with Democrats on the budget after it became clear that Republicans lacked enough votes to pass a long-term spending bill on their own.</span> As a result, the GOP leaders have had the uncomfortable task of writing a measure that ignores nearly all of Trump\u2019s priorities, including money for the border wall.\nSchumer also sought to refocus blame on the GOP, arguing that the only thing standing in the way of a long-term agreement was Trump himself. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Congressional leaders were nearing a final deal several weeks ago, but the talks were derailed when Office of Management and budget director Mick Mulvaney announced that Trump would demand that money for the border wall be included in the funding bill.\n</span>\u201cUnfortunately the president stood in the way for quite a long time,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re a little delayed.\u201d\nCongressional leaders had hoped to finalize a spending deal by midweek, but the talks were stuck on a small number of unrelated policy provisions, known as riders. Democrats complained that GOP leaders were trying to use the spending bill to cut abortion access and scale back Wall Street reforms passed under President Barack Obama.\nPelosi accused Republicans of complicating the negotiations with unnecessary demands.\n\u201cThey\u2019re mixing apples and oranges here,\u201d Pelosi said at a weekly news conference. \u201cThey are making matters worse.\u201d\nRepublicans have lodged similar complaints about Democrats\u2019 demands for an extension of health-care benefits for miners and money to help Puerto Rico continue making Medicaid payments that were subsidized under Obamacare.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Trump criticized the demand in his Thursday morning tweetstorm as a bailout for insurance companies in Puerto Rico, a criticism repeated later in the day by White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\n</span>Spicer said Democrats have shifted their demands as the spending negotiations wear on.\n\u201cThey keep moving the goal post,\u201d Spicer said. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe issue right now is to make sure that we do what\u2019s in the best interest of this country and our people by keeping the government open.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The continued fighting comes despite signs of agreement Wednesday when Trump announced plans to continue cost-sharing payments under the ACA.\nRepublicans have not indicated how they plan to handle the policy provisions, but most GOP negotiators said they were pleased with the direction of the negotiations.\n</span>The long-term spending bill is expected to include several White House priorities, such as increases in funding for border security and defense spending, including an unspecified amount to repair fencing and new surveillance technology to patrol the <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 2,000</span>-mile border, the aides said. Democrats have said they support increased border security as long as no money goes toward building a physical wall.\nRobert Costa and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report."}, "124": {"id":

id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nThe emergence of a two-tiered U.S. economy, with wealthy households advancing while middle- and lower-income Americans struggle, is reshaping markets for everything from housing to clothing to groceries to beer.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two economies,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage in Seattle that operates <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 25 states</span>.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is a high-end market that is absolutely booming.</span> And then there\u2019s everyone in the middle class. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They don\u2019t have much hope of wage growth.\u201d\n\n</span>The recession blew holes in the balance sheets of all U.S. households and ended a decadeslong loosening of credit for middle-class borrowers. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Now, credit is tight, and incomes have been flat or falling for all but the top 10th of U.S. income earners <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2010 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013,</span> according to the Federal Reserve.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">American spending patterns after the recession underscore why many U.S. businesses are reorienting to serve higher-income households, said Barry Cynamon, of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2009,</span> average per household spending among the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 5% of</span> U.S. income earners\u2014adjusting for inflation\u2014<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 12% through</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> the most recent data available.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Over the same period, spending by all others <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 1% per</span> household, according to Mr. Cynamon, a visiting scholar at the bank\u2019s Center for Household Financial Stability, and Steven Fazzari of Washington University in St. Louis, who published their research findings last year.\n\n</span>The spending rebound following the recession \u201cappears to be largely driven by the consumption at the top,\u201d Mr. Cynamon said. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">He and Mr. Fazzari found the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wealthiest 5% of</span> U.S. households accounted for <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 30% of</span> consumer spending in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> up <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 23% in</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1992.</span>\n\n</span>Indeed, such midtier retailers as J.C. Penney, Sears and Target have slumped. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe consumer has not bounced back with the confidence we were all looking for,\u201d Macy\u2019s chief executive Terry Lundgren told investors last fall.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In luxury retail, meanwhile: \u201cOur customers are confident, feel good about the economy in general and their personal balance sheets specifically,\u201d said Karen Katz, chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group Ltd., last month.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Reported 2014 revenues</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $4.8 billion</span> for the company are up <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $3.6 billion</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span>\n\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Revenue for such luxury hotel chains as St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 35% last</span> year compared <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 2008,</span> according to market research firm STR Inc. Revenues at midscale chains such as Best Western and Ramada were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 1%.</span></span>\n\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">On grocery aisles, the recession and its aftermath boosted sales of economy brands.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">At the high end, Whole Foods Market Inc. reported record sales per gross square foot last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cDemand bifurcated,\u201d said Jason Green, chief executive of the Cambridge Group, a growth strategy firm that is part of Nielsen NV.</span> \u201cThe familiar stuff my middle-class family had in the pantry, those are under significant pressure.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In the grocery market\u2019s middle tier, Safeway Inc., the second-largest supermarket chain in the U.S. was purchased last year by the private-equity group that owns Albertsons, the fifth-largest grocery retailer.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Company officials said the deal would allow the companies to reduce costs\u2014and lower prices for customers\u2014as they fend off competition from low-price outlets and high-end stores.\n\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">In the cold case, sales of premium lagers are <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16% since</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2007 after</span> adjusting for inflation, while sales of economy brands <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 8%,</span> according to research firm Euromonitor International.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Sales of midprice beers are <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 1%.</span></span>\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The trend hit auto makers some years ago, when BMW AG\u2019s former chief executive Helmut Panke described the U.S. market as an hourglass: lots of demand for budget and luxury brands but little in between.\n\nSteve Bates, general manager of BMW Seattle for the <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 12 years</span>, said new-car sales at his dealership were <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 25% last</span> year, while used-car sales were flat.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The M4 series, a sporty coupe priced <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $64,000,</span> has been \u201cselling out as soon as it touches the ground,\u201d he said.\n\n</span>Then there are consumers like Vicki Oliver,<span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68 years</span> old, of Temecula, Calif. She bought a used Hyundai Sonata last year to replace a <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wrecked 1995 Ford</span> Explorer. Ms. Oliver and her husband, a real-estate agent, added onto their home two years ago so her daughter and son-in-law, a general contractor, could move in with their family.\n\n\u201cThat was a way to make things work in hard times,\u201d Ms. Oliver said. Caribbean cruises and trips to Florida are now memories. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that for years,\u201d she said.\n\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The housing market illustrates how weakness among middle-class consumers holds back the U.S. economy.</span> Homes are generally the biggest purchase Americans make. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Housing dollars ripple through the economy by triggering spending on appliances, furniture and landscaping.\n\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">For the first time, U.S. builders last year sold slightly more homes priced <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $400,000 than</span> those <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $200,000.</span></span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">As a result, the median price of new homes <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeded $280,000,</span> a record in nominal terms <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 2% shy</span> of <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2006 inflation</span>-adjusted peak.\n\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Total sales last year, however, were up <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 1% compared</span> with<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013,</span> and more <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50% below</span> their average <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2000 to</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2002,</span> before the housing bubble.\n\n</span>New homes are also getting bigger. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The median U.S. home was more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,400 square</span> feet in the third quarter <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2014,</span> <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20% increase</span> from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2000 and</span> <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10% increase</span> from the peak of the housing market <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span>\n\n</span>In Seattle, the median new-home size <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped 2,500 square</span> feet last year, a record, according to research firm Metrostudy Inc. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Since the market hit bottom <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span> sales of new homes priced <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $600,000 have</span> tripled, while sales <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $400,000 are</span> <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 16%,</span> according to CoreLogic DataQuick.\n\n</span>Builders boost profits selling more expensive homes. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But less construction overall means fewer new jobs and reduced total spending.\n\n</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">\u201cOver the long haul, I worry that you can\u2019t run our housing market, which depends on volume, on affluent buyers alone,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.\n\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Young households have been slow to buy homes because of the tough job market.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Many would-be buyers can\u2019t save enough for a down payment or don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for a mortgage.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Student debt holds others back.\n\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">A typical household, for example, would need <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $60,000 in</span> cash to make <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20% down</span> payment on the median-priced new home in the U.S. To qualify for a mortgage, they would need good credit and to show an annual income of <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $45,000,</span> assuming little other household debt.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">A government-insured loan in this example could call for <span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $11,000 down</span> payment but would require an annual income <span id=\"85\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $60,000.</span>\n\n</span>Lisa and Nathan Trione are looking for a house in Denver big enough for their five children. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">But there is little in their price range:<span id=\"86\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $250,000 and</span> under.\n\n</span>\u201cYou\u2019re already intimidated by the process,\u201d said Ms. Trione, a 28-year-old paralegal and office manager. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd then you see this huge price, and you say, \u2018I\u2019m not ready to do that right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Trione is paying off debt she incurred while earning her associate degree.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">She also is trying to raise her credit score, which, she said, fell during a series of early financial missteps.\n\n</span>Well-heeled customers, meanwhile, have their pick of mortgages. At the same time, some banks have pulled back from federally insured loans that allow for smaller down payments.\n\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe would like to build a smaller, higher-quality and less-volatile business,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., told investors last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">With fewer potential customers, builders have largely abandoned the entry-level market.</span> \u201cIf a builder can make money on something, he\u2019ll build it. The problem is that they can\u2019t make money at the entry level,\u201d said John Burns, of Irvine, Calif., a consultant to builders.\n\n<span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">But rentals, the low-end of the housing market, are booming.</span> Apartment construction has neared its fastest pace <span id=\"87\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1989.</span> Two of the nation\u2019s largest home builders, Toll Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., have both launched multifamily construction divisions, each with <span id=\"88\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 5,000 units</span> in the pipeline.\n\n<span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe all wished we had a big apartment portfolio through this downturn,\u201d said Douglas Yearley, Toll\u2019s chief executive, during an earnings call last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">With sales plunging <span id=\"89\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009,</span> Quadrant called in a research firm that concluded more buyers might materialize if the company built more expensive homes.</span> \u201cWhen it\u2019s data driven, the courage to make a remarkable change is easier than when you\u2019re using your gut,\u201d said Mr. Krivanec, the company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nQuadrant, a unit of TRI Pointe Homes Inc., was finishing seven homes per workday <span id=\"90\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004.</span> They now finish less than two of the more expensive houses a day. But the share of buyers who back out of a deal, typically because they can\u2019t get a loan, is <span id=\"91\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 10% since</span><span id=\"92\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010.</span>\n\nTo serve more higher-end buyers, Quadrant opened a design studio two years ago that lets buyers choose from dozens of cabinets, countertops, tiles and flooring. <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">Some new buyers spend nearly twice as much on such upgrades, the company said, which adds to the profitability of home sales.\n\n</span>Common design features now include a walk-in closet and bathroom nearly as big as the master bedroom. Kitchens have a walk-in pantry.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday afternoon on Little Bear Creek Place, a cul-de-sac in this Seattle suburb, electricians, landscapers and framers worked on <span id=\"93\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 23 Quadrant</span> home sites.\n\nNearby, Nick and Adriana Stoll unpacked boxes in their new four-bedroom home. The home is twice the size of <span id=\"94\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,200</span>-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment they rented in nearby Bellevue.\n\nThe Stolls customized almost every feature and finish, including hinges on kitchen cabinets that prevent the doors from slamming shut. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m typically the kind of consumer where I make a quick decision,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.</span> \u201cBut when it comes to your home, well, we stared <span id=\"95\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 100 countertops</span> for an hour.\u201d\n\nThe Stolls survived the recession and have prospered. <span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Mr. Stoll purchased a Seattle condominium <span id=\"96\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008,</span> the day before learning he was losing his job at Washington Mutual, the thrift sold to J.P. Morgan after it was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nMr. Stoll changed jobs twice before he was recruited <span id=\"97\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 to</span> work at a technology company.</span> He broke even on the sale of his condo last year. \u201cOther people encountered problems where maybe it\u2019s student loans or credit cards or car payments,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have none of that.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The couple <span id=\"98\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">put 20% down</span> on their new home, which <span id=\"99\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">cost $579,000.</span></span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Ms. Stoll works as a client associate for a large financial services company.\n\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Growth in new home sales this year will depend, in part, on whether builders revive their interest in first-time buyers.\n\n</span>Two years ago, D.R. Horton Inc., the nation\u2019s largest home builder, launched Emerald Homes, a luxury division. <span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Last year, the company rolled out Express Homes, a division that pioneered

with wealthy households advancing while middle- and lower-income Americans struggle, is reshaping markets for everything from housing to clothing to groceries to beer.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two economies,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage in Seattle that operates <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 25 states</span>.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is a high-end market that is absolutely booming.</span> And then there\u2019s everyone in the middle class. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They don\u2019t have much hope of wage growth.\u201d\n\n</span>The recession blew holes in the balance sheets of all U.S. households and ended a decadeslong loosening of credit for middle-class borrowers. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Now, credit is tight, and incomes have been flat or falling for all but the top 10th of U.S. income earners <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2010 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013,</span> according to the Federal Reserve.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">American spending patterns after the recession underscore why many U.S. businesses are reorienting to serve higher-income households, said Barry Cynamon, of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2009,</span> average per household spending among the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 5% of</span> U.S. income earners\u2014adjusting for inflation\u2014<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 12% through</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> the most recent data available.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Over the same period, spending by all others <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 1% per</span> household, according to Mr. Cynamon, a visiting scholar at the bank\u2019s Center for Household Financial Stability, and Steven Fazzari of Washington University in St. Louis, who published their research findings last year.\n\n</span>The spending rebound following the recession \u201cappears to be largely driven by the consumption at the top,\u201d Mr. Cynamon said. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">He and Mr. Fazzari found the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wealthiest 5% of</span> U.S. households accounted for <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 30% of</span> consumer spending in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> up <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 23% in</span><span id=\"43\"

Penney, Sears and Target have slumped. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe consumer has not bounced back with the confidence we were all looking for,\u201d Macy\u2019s chief executive Terry Lundgren told investors last fall.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In luxury retail, meanwhile: \u201cOur customers are confident, feel good about the economy in general and their personal balance sheets specifically,\u201d said Karen Katz, chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group Ltd., last month.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Reported 2014 revenues</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $4.8 billion</span> for the company are up <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $3.6 billion</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span>\n\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Revenue for such luxury hotel chains as St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 35% last</span> year compared <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 2008,</span> according to market research firm STR Inc. Revenues at midscale chains such as Best Western and Ramada were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 1%.</span></span>\n\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">On grocery aisles, the recession and its aftermath boosted sales of economy brands.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">At the high end, Whole Foods Market Inc. reported record sales per gross square foot last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cDemand bifurcated,\u201d said Jason Green, chief executive of the Cambridge Group, a growth strategy firm that is part of Nielsen NV.</span> \u201cThe familiar stuff my middle-class family had in the pantry, those are under significant pressure.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In the grocery market\u2019s middle tier, Safeway Inc., the second-largest supermarket chain in the U.S. was purchased last year by the private-equity group that owns Albertsons, the fifth-largest grocery retailer.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Company officials said the deal would allow the companies to reduce costs\u2014and lower prices for customers\u2014as they fend off competition from low-price outlets and high-end stores.\n\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">In the cold case, sales of premium lagers are <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16% since</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2007 after</span> adjusting for inflation, while sales of economy brands <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">grew 8%,</span> according to research firm Euromonitor International.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Sales of midprice beers are <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 1%.</span></span>\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The trend hit auto makers some years ago, when BMW AG\u2019s former chief executive Helmut Panke described the U.S. market as an hourglass: lots of demand for budget and luxury brands but little in between.\n\nSteve Bates, general manager of BMW Seattle for the <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 12 years</span>, said new-car sales at his dealership were <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 25% last</span> year, while used-car sales were flat.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The M4 series, a sporty coupe priced <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $64,000,</span> has been \u201cselling out as soon as it touches the ground,\u201d he said.\n\n</span>Then there are consumers like Vicki Oliver,<span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68 years</span> old, of Temecula, Calif. She bought a used Hyundai Sonata last year to replace a <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wrecked 1995 Ford</span> Explorer. Ms. Oliver and her husband, a real-estate agent, added onto their home two years ago so her daughter and son-in-law, a general contractor, could move in with their family.\n\n\u201cThat was a way to make things work in hard times,\u201d Ms. Oliver said. Caribbean cruises and trips to Florida are now memories. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that for years,\u201d she said.\n\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The housing market illustrates how weakness among middle-class consumers holds back the U.S. economy.</span> Homes are generally the biggest purchase Americans make. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Housing dollars ripple through the economy by triggering spending on appliances, furniture and landscaping.\n\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">For the first time, U.S. builders last year sold slightly more homes priced <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $400,000 than</span> those <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $200,000.</span></span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">As a result, the median price of new homes <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeded $280,000,</span> a record in nominal terms <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 2% shy</span> of <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2006 inflation</span>-adjusted peak.\n\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Total sales last year, however, were up <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 1% compared</span> with<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013,</span> and more <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50% below</span> their average <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2000 to</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2002,</span> before the housing bubble.\n\n</span>New homes are also getting bigger. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The median U.S. home was more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,400 square</span> feet in the third quarter <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2014,</span> <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20% increase</span> from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2000 and</span> <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10% increase</span> from the peak of the housing market <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span>\n\n</span>In Seattle, the median new-home size <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">topped 2,500 square</span> feet last year, a record, according to research firm Metrostudy Inc. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Since the market hit bottom <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011,</span> sales of new homes priced <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $600,000 have</span> tripled, while sales <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $400,000 are</span> <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 16%,</span> according to CoreLogic DataQuick.\n\n</span>Builders boost profits selling more expensive homes. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But less construction overall means fewer new jobs and reduced total spending.\n\n</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">\u201cOver the long haul, I worry that you can\u2019t run our housing market, which depends on volume, on affluent buyers alone,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.\n\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Young households have been slow to buy homes because of the tough job market.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Many would-be buyers can\u2019t save enough for a down payment or don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for a mortgage.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Student debt holds others back.\n\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">A typical household, for example, would need <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $60,000 in</span> cash to make <span id=\"82\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20% down</span> payment on the median-priced new home in the U.S. To qualify for a mortgage, they would need good credit and to show an annual income of <span id=\"83\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $45,000,</span> assuming little other household debt.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">A government-insured loan in this example could call for <span id=\"84\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $11,000 down</span> payment but would require an annual income <span id=\"85\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $60,000.</span>\n\n</span>Lisa and Nathan Trione are looking for a house in Denver big enough for their five children. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">But there is little in their price range:<span id=\"86\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $250,000 and</span> under.\n\n</span>\u201cYou\u2019re already intimidated by the process,\u201d said Ms. Trione, a 28-year-old paralegal and office manager. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd then you see this huge price, and you say, \u2018I\u2019m not ready to do that right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Trione is paying off debt she incurred while earning her associate degree.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">She also is trying to raise her credit score, which, she said, fell during a series of early financial missteps.\n\n</span>Well-heeled customers, meanwhile, have their pick of mortgages. At the same time, some banks have pulled back from federally insured loans that allow for smaller down payments.\n\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe would like to build a smaller, higher-quality and less-volatile business,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., told investors last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">With fewer potential customers, builders have largely abandoned the entry-level market.</span> \u201cIf a builder can make money on something, he\u2019ll build it. The problem is that they can\u2019t make money at the entry level,\u201d said John Burns, of Irvine, Calif., a consultant to builders.\n\n<span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">But rentals, the low-end of the housing market, are booming.</span> Apartment construction has neared its fastest pace <span id=\"87\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1989.</span> Two of the nation\u2019s largest home builders, Toll Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., have both launched multifamily construction divisions, each with <span id=\"88\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 5,000 units</span> in the pipeline.\n\n<span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe all wished we had a big apartment portfolio through this downturn,\u201d said Douglas Yearley, Toll\u2019s chief executive, during an earnings call last year.\n\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">With sales plunging <span id=\"89\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009,</span> Quadrant called in a research firm that concluded more buyers might materialize if the company built more expensive homes.</span> \u201cWhen it\u2019s data driven, the courage to make a remarkable change is easier than when you\u2019re using your gut,\u201d said Mr. Krivanec, the company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nQuadrant, a unit of TRI Pointe Homes Inc., was finishing seven homes per workday <span id=\"90\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004.</span> They now finish less than two of the more expensive houses a day. But the share of buyers who back out of a deal, typically because they can\u2019t get a loan, is <span id=\"91\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 10% since</span><span id=\"92\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2010.</span>\n\nTo serve more higher-end buyers, Quadrant opened a design studio two years ago that lets buyers choose from dozens of cabinets, countertops, tiles and flooring. <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">Some new buyers spend nearly twice as much on such upgrades, the company said, which adds to the profitability of home sales.\n\n</span>Common design features now include a walk-in closet and bathroom nearly as big as the master bedroom. Kitchens have a walk-in pantry.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday afternoon on Little Bear Creek Place, a cul-de-sac in this Seattle suburb, electricians, landscapers and framers worked on <span id=\"93\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 23 Quadrant</span> home sites.\n\nNearby, Nick and Adriana Stoll unpacked boxes in their new four-bedroom home. The home is twice the size of <span id=\"94\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,200</span>-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment they rented in nearby Bellevue.\n\nThe Stolls customized almost every feature and finish, including hinges on kitchen cabinets that prevent the doors from slamming shut. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m typically the kind of consumer where I make a quick decision,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.</span> \u201cBut when it comes to your home, well, we stared <span id=\"95\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 100 countertops</span> for an hour.\u201d\n\nThe Stolls survived the recession and have prospered. <span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Mr. Stoll purchased a Seattle condominium <span id=\"96\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008,</span> the day before learning he was losing his job at Washington Mutual, the thrift sold to J.P. Morgan after it was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nMr. Stoll changed jobs twice before he was recruited <span id=\"97\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 to</span> work at a technology company.</span> He broke even on the sale of his condo last year. \u201cOther people encountered problems where maybe it\u2019s student loans or credit cards or car payments,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have none of that.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The couple <span id=\"98\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">put 20% down</span> on their new home, which <span id=\"99\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">cost $579,000.</span></span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Ms. Stoll works as a client associate for a large financial services company.\n\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Growth in new home sales this year will depend, in part, on whether builders revive their interest in first-time buyers.\n\n</span>Two years ago, D.R. Horton Inc., the nation\u2019s largest home builder, launched Emerald Homes, a luxury division. <span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Last year, the company rolled out Express Homes, a division that pioneered no-frills housing for the entry-level market.\n\n</span>Mr. Krivanec, Quadrant\u2019s CEO, said he doesn\u2019t see a return to his company\u2019s former model. <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">There are enough people with good-paying jobs in the area\u2014at Boeing, Amazon and Microsoft\u2014to keep sales going, even it means building fewer homes.</span> \u201cWe like where we\u2019re at,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Kris Hudson at kris.hudson@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "24673": {"id": "24673", "text": "<h3>This Year\u2019s Selloff in Chinese Markets Isn\u2019t Like 2015.

their tax returns conduct traditional business activity, according to the Treasury analysis.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Some \u201cnon-business\u201d pass-throughs claim a small amount of income or losses, indicating that they may be claiming earnings from hobbies or vacation home rentals, for example.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Others deduct a small amount of expenses and are most likely to be independent contractors who solely provide labor services, like an IT specialist who operates as a sole proprietor and contracts with another company.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Because pass-through rates will be lower than rates for individual income taxes, the bill would provide an incentive for people to find ways to classify their earnings as business income to take advantage of the lower rates.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">For example, a journalist could cease to be a direct employee of a company and then contract as a sole proprietor with that same company to benefit from the pass-through tax deduction (though, they would have to pay for their benefits and more of their own payroll taxes).\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The bill

<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But there are a handful of very large pass-throughs, including law firms, hedge funds and multibillion-dollar businesses like Georgia-Pacific (a Koch Industries

accountant or a house painter who does not employ anyone else but meets the analysis\u2019 definition of a business owner because he deducts a large amount of expenses for things like office space and supplies.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Ultimately,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 percent</span> of all individuals claiming pass-through income were

John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the three senators who said they oppose McConnell\u2019s new bill.\nThe GOP\u2019s continuing push \u2014 and continuing struggle \u2014 to make good on a campaign promise it began invoking seven years ago to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare reflected the peril Republicans face whether they pass a bill or not.\nOn the one hand, the ACA has provided medical coverage for millions of Americans \u2014 and has grown more popular as a result. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Moderate Republicans remained concerned Thursday that the new proposal would make insurance unaffordable for some middle-income Americans and throw millions off the rolls of Medicaid, the public insurance for disabled and low-income Americans.\n</span>Yet conservatives continued to push for a more wholesale rollback of the ACA \u2014 highlighting the danger for all Republicans of failing to achieve a promise most of them made on the campaign trail.\n\u201cThe new Senate health care bill is substantially different from the version released last month, and it is unclear to me whether it has improved,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), a conservative who has pushed for a full Obamacare repeal, said in a statement. \u201cI will need time to study the new version and speak with experts about whether it does enough to lower health insurance premiums for middle class families.\u201d\nLooming even larger was the reality that Republicans, despite their control of both chambers of Congress and with President Trump in the White House, have made little progress on an ambitious agenda that McConnell had hoped to move on to next week after a vote on the health-care bill. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Among their goals are major tax legislation, raising the debt ceiling and passing a defense authorization bill.\n</span>Republican leaders seemed to acknowledge Thursday the difficult path ahead, with several speaking privately about internal divisions on how to pass the bill \u2014 and to prevent further defections.\n\u201cWe will have the votes when we start voting,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.).\nMcConnell\u2019s new draft was the result of weeks of negotiations with conservatives and moderates. For those on the right, the plan incorporated a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) allowing insurers to offer minimalist policies as long as they offer more-comprehensive ones as well. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Cruz said the provision would give consumers greater choice and lower-cost premiums.\n</span>For those in the center, the new proposal would spend an <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $70 billion</span> offsetting consumers\u2019 costs <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $45 billion</span> to treat opioid addiction.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Republicans financed these changes by keeping a trio of Obamacare taxes targeting high-earners \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 3.8 percent</span> tax on net investment income and <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.9 percent</span> Medicare payroll tax on individuals <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $200,000 a</span> year or couples <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning $250,000,</span> along with a tax on insurers with high-paid executives.</span> Lawmakers such as Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said repealing those taxes would give too much relief to the wealthy at the expense of the poor.\nThe new measure has won Cruz\u2019s backing, but Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another conservative who said the measure still does not do enough to unravel Obamacare, remained opposed to voting on the bill, as did two centrists, McCain and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\u201cMy strong intention and current inclination is to vote no on the motion to proceed,\u201d Collins told reporters, referring to the procedural vote required before the legislation can reach the Senate floor. Collins added that she hopes Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the three senators who said they oppose McConnell\u2019s new bill.\nThe GOP\u2019s continuing push \u2014 and continuing struggle \u2014 to make good on a campaign promise it began invoking seven years ago to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare reflected the peril Republicans face whether they pass a bill or not.\nOn the one hand, the ACA has provided medical coverage for millions of Americans \u2014 and has grown more popular as a result. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Moderate Republicans remained concerned Thursday that the new proposal would make insurance unaffordable for some middle-income Americans and throw millions off the rolls of Medicaid, the public insurance for disabled and low-income Americans.\n</span>Yet conservatives continued to push for a more wholesale rollback of the ACA \u2014 highlighting the danger for all Republicans of failing to achieve a promise most of them made on the campaign trail.\n\u201cThe new Senate health care bill is substantially different from the version released last month, and it is unclear to me whether it has improved,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), a conservative who has pushed for a full Obamacare repeal, said in a statement. \u201cI will need time to study the new version and speak with experts about whether it does enough to lower health insurance premiums for middle class families.\u201d\nLooming even larger was the reality that Republicans, despite their control of both chambers of Congress and with President Trump in the White House, have made little progress on an ambitious agenda that McConnell had hoped to move on to next week after a vote on the health-care bill. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Among their goals are major tax legislation, raising the debt ceiling and passing a defense authorization bill.\n</span>Republican leaders seemed to acknowledge Thursday the difficult path ahead, with several speaking privately about internal divisions on how to pass the bill \u2014 and to prevent further defections.\n\u201cWe will have the votes when we start voting,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.).\nMcConnell\u2019s new draft was the result of weeks of negotiations with conservatives and moderates. For those on the right, the plan incorporated a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) allowing insurers to offer minimalist policies as long as they offer more-comprehensive ones as well. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Cruz said the provision would give consumers greater choice and lower-cost premiums.\n</span>For those in the center, the new proposal would spend an <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $70 billion</span> offsetting consumers\u2019 costs <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $45 billion</span> to treat opioid addiction.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Republicans financed these changes by keeping a trio of Obamacare taxes targeting high-earners \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 3.8 percent</span> tax on net investment income and <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.9 percent</span> Medicare payroll tax on individuals <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">making $200,000 a</span> year or couples <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning $250,000,</span> along with a tax on insurers with high-paid executives.</span> Lawmakers such as Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said repealing those taxes would give too much relief to the wealthy at the expense of the poor.\nThe new measure has won Cruz\u2019s backing, but Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another conservative who said the measure still does not do enough to unravel Obamacare, remained opposed to voting on the bill, as did two centrists, McCain and Sen.

Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy.</span> To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">The next day, board members \u2014 many of them Republican donors \u2014 got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.</span> Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and \u201cit\u2019s pretty close to airtight,\u201d Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was \u201ccontained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don\u2019t know,\u201d according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover\u2019s board, was stark. \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus \u201cas a point of concern, totally unprovoked.\u201d\nThe consultant\u2019s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president\u2019s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.\n<span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering.\n</span>To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cShort everything,\u201d was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u2014 Kate Kelly and\nAmericans used one-time stimulus checks they received from the federal government early in the pandemic to pad their savings accounts and pay off debt, new research from the Federal Reserve shows.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Households spent <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 29 percent</span> of the money they received earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a post on its website, citing its Survey of Consumer Expectations, conducted in June and August.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Another 36 percent</span> of the cash was saved, <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">while 35 percent</span> was used to pay down debt.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Americans adults who qualified for the stimulus received up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,200 each</span>, with an <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $500 added</span> per child in the household.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Out of the Fed\u2019s sample,<span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 89 percent</span> of households received money.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">Poorer families and those who lost jobs or income amid the pandemic were more likely to use their money to pay down debts, while richer families saved the money.\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic impact payments, by increasing both household income and the debt pay down, contributed importantly to the sharp increase in the overall saving rate during the early months of the pandemic,\u201d the central bank\u2019s researchers wrote in the post.\n</span>Several factors might have been behind the relatively low spending and high saving. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">People were unsure when the economic crisis would clear up, the researchers wrote, and might have been acting cautiously.</span> They were on lockdown, which might have limited opportunities to spend, and some rent payments \u2014 which count as consumption \u2014 were delayed.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">The trends seem unlikely to change if new aid becomes available: In the August survey, the New York Fed asked what households might do if they received <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $1,500 check</span>.</span> Respondents expect to spend even less of that money, <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 24 percent</span>.\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The newfound savings buffer cushioned the blow as expanded unemployment insurance expired.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Consumer spending has held up even though millions remain unemployed but are no longer receiving an <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $600 per</span> week from the federal government.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re still benefiting from the stimulus,\u201d Randal K.

On Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged it would be difficult to pass and enact a deal in the next three weeks.\nIn the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more \u201ctargeted\u201d relief bill.\nNegotiators have been locked in fruitless talks for months. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin assailed Democrats for letting politics get in the way of reaching agreement before the election, though President Trump scuttled the talks himself when he said in a tweet last week that he had called off stimulus negotiations until after the election.</span> The majority of Senate Republicans have also warned that they cannot accept the <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">latest $1.8 trillion</span> framework Mr. Mnuchin has put forward, even as Ms. Pelosi insists that plan is inadequate.\nMr. Mnuchin also called on Congress to give him the authority to repurpose <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately $300 billion</span> in unused relief money from the legislation that was passed in March. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He said he could begin getting that money into the economy this week.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nMore and more Americans are relying on a federal program designed to help the jobless as state unemployment benefits run out.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The program, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, was created by Congress in March to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">provide 13 weeks</span> of aid when regular state unemployment benefits expire \u2014 typically <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 26 weeks</span>.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">It has now been more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 weeks</span> since unemployment claims spiked in March, when the pandemic first forced the economy into lockdown mode, so millions of unemployed Americans are starting to qualify for the extended benefits.\n</span>But getting on the rolls isn\u2019t easy, experts say. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe transition from regular state benefits to P.E.U.C. is not going smoothly,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">In some places, recipients of state unemployment benefits haven\u2019t been notified of their eligibility for the federal extension, and aging computer systems have slowed the processing of applications.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Still, in the week that ended Sept.<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 26,</span> the most recent period with available data, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 2.8 million</span> people were getting Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits, a jump from fewer than two million the previous week.</span> That increase was roughly equal to the decline in the number collecting state benefits.\nThe federal program is set to expire at the end of the year, and if it is not extended by Congress, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see a disaster,\u201d Ms. Shierholz said. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere will be a huge drop in living standards and an increase in poverty as well as downward pressure on economic growth.\u201d\n</span>For those who qualify, the program has helped as they search for work.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Jared Gaxiola of Torrance, Calif., was laid off from his job as a freelance lighting technician in March, after live events were canceled across the country.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Gaxiola\u2019s state benefits ran out in mid-September, he was able to get a 13-week extension through Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Mr. Gaxiola,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35,</span> hopes to find a job by the time the payments run out again in December.</span> But with entertainment work still scarce, he worries about how he will pay his rent in the new year.\n\u201cI could probably borrow money from my sister if I needed to,\u201d Mr. Gaxiola said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t want to have to do that.\u201d\n\u2014 Nelson D.

Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy.</span> To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">The next day, board members \u2014 many of them Republican donors \u2014 got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.</span> Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and \u201cit\u2019s pretty close to airtight,\u201d Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was \u201ccontained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don\u2019t know,\u201d according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover\u2019s board, was stark. \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus \u201cas a point of concern, totally unprovoked.\u201d\nThe consultant\u2019s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president\u2019s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.\n<span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering.\n</span>To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cShort everything,\u201d was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u2014 Kate Kelly and\nAmericans used one-time stimulus checks they received from the federal government early in the pandemic to pad their savings accounts and pay off debt, new research from the Federal Reserve shows.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Households spent <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 29 percent</span> of the money they received earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a post on its website, citing its Survey of Consumer Expectations, conducted in June and August.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Another 36 percent</span> of the cash was saved, <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">while 35 percent</span> was used to pay down debt.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Americans adults who qualified for the stimulus received up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,200 each</span>, with an <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $500 added</span> per child in the household.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Out of the Fed\u2019s sample,<span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 89 percent</span> of households received money.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">Poorer families and those who lost jobs or income amid the pandemic were more likely to use their money to pay down debts, while richer families saved the money.\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic impact payments, by increasing both household income and the debt pay down, contributed importantly to the sharp increase in the overall saving rate during the early months of the pandemic,\u201d the central bank\u2019s researchers wrote in the post.\n</span>Several factors might have been behind the relatively low spending and high saving. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">People were unsure when the economic crisis would clear up, the researchers wrote, and might have been acting cautiously.</span> They were on lockdown, which might have limited opportunities to spend, and some rent payments \u2014 which count as consumption \u2014 were delayed.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">The trends seem unlikely to change if new aid becomes available: In the August survey, the New York Fed asked what households might do if they received <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $1,500 check</span>.</span> Respondents expect to spend even less of that money, <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 24 percent</span>.\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The newfound savings buffer cushioned the blow as expanded unemployment insurance expired.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Consumer spending has held up even though millions remain unemployed but are no longer receiving an <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $600 per</span> week from the federal government.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re still benefiting from the stimulus,\u201d Randal K.
