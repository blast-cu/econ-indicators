Around this time last year, Zillow closed its own iBuying division after losing buckets of money.

On Saturday, officials <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 793 additional</span> deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting pandemic.\nThe government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in Lombardy, the northern region at the center of the outbreak, where bodies have piled up in churches. On Friday night, the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.\nThe tragedy of Italy now stands as a warning to its European neighbors and the United States, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. If Italy\u2019s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion \u2014 when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.\n</span>Italy\u2019s piecemeal attempts to cut it off \u2014 isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown \u2014 always lagged behind the virus\u2019s lethal trajectory.\n\u201cNow we are running after it,\u201d said Sandra Zampa, the under secretary at the Ministry of Health, who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had. \u201cWe closed gradually, as Europe is doing. France, Spain, Germany, the U.S. are doing the same. Every day you close a bit, you give up on a bit of normal life.

That same day, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, the former leader of one of the governing parties, the Five Star Movement, held a news conference in Rome.\n\u201cIn Italy, we went from the risk of an epidemic to an infodemic,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said, disparaging media coverage that highlighted the threat of the contagion, and adding that only \u201c0.089 percent\u201d of the Italian population was quarantined.\nIn Milan, only miles from the center of the outbreak, the mayor, Beppe Sala, publicized a \u2018\u2018Milan Doesn\u2019t Stop\u2019\u2019 campaign, and the Duomo, the city\u2019s landmark cathedral that is a draw for tourists, reopened. People went out.\nBut on the sixth floor of the regional government headquarters in Milan, Giacomo Grasselli, who is the coordinator of the intensive care units throughout Lombardy, saw the numbers going up and quickly realized that it would be impossible to treat all the sick if the infections continued unabated.\nHis task force worked to match the sick to beds in intensive-care units in the nearest possible hospitals and appropriate dwindling resources.\nAt one of the daily meetings of <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 health</span> and political officials, he told the regional president, Attilio Fontana, about the growing numbers.\nAn epidemiologist showed the curves of infection. There was a catastrophe facing the region\u2019s well-respected health system.\n\u201cWe need to do something more,\u201d Mr. Grasselli told the room.\nMr. Fontana, who had been pressing the central government for tougher action, agreed. He said that the mixed messages from Rome and the easing of restrictions had led Italians to believe \u201cthat everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to.\u201d\nHe said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,\u201d said Mr. Fontana.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 billion</span> euro ($28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn\u2019t.\n</span>Ms. Zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of V\u00f2, the virus epicenter of the Veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the Codogno outbreak.\nShe said that the health minister, Mr. Speranza, and Mr. Conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In a <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surprise 2 a</span>.m. news conference on <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 8,</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">when 7,375 people</span> had already tested positive for coronavirus <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 366 had</span> died, Mr. Conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country\u2019s economic engine.\n</span>\u201cWe are facing an emergency,\u201d Mr. Conte said at the time. \u201cA national emergency.\u201d\nA draft of the decree, leaked to Italian media on Saturday night, pushed many Milan residents to rush to the train station in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.\nYet the following day, most Italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.\nTo clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued \u201cauto-certification\u201d forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or \u201cother\u201d necessities.\nIn the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self quarantine. Others didn\u2019t.\nThe broader restrictions in Lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on Codogno and other \u201cred zone\u201d towns linked to the original outbreak. Checkpoints disappeared. Local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.\nThree days later, on <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 11,</span> when the positive cases <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 12,462 and</span> the death toll climbed <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 827,</span> Mr. Conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.\nBut by then, some experts say, it was already too late.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Local Experiments\nItaly is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians.</span> The staggering number of recent deaths \u2014 more <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,300 in</span> the last four days \u2014 are of people infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.\nRoberto Burioni, a prominent virologist at the San Raffaele University in Milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to \u201cthat behavior.\u201d\nThe government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. But on Saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.\nLeaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.\nOn Friday, Mr. Fontana complained that <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 114 troops</span> the government deployed were insignificant, and that at <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 1,000 should</span> be sent. He said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and \u201capply rigid measures.\u201d\n\u201cMy idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,\u201d he said.\nHis political ally, Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, pre-empted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that Rome needed to enforce \u201ca more drastic isolation,\u201d including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.\n\u201cWalks should be banned,\u201d he said.\nMr. Zaia has some credibility on the issue. As new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in V\u00f2, a town of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 3,000 people</span> that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country\u2019s first coronavirus death.\nSome government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. But Mr. Zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. The government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.\n\u201cAt least this slows down the virus\u2019 speed,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. \u2018\u2018And slowing down the virus\u2019 speed allows the hospitals to breathe.\u2019\u2019\nIf not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.\nAmericans and others, he said, \u201cneed to be ready.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Italy, Pandemic\u2019s New Epicenter, Has Lessons for the World</h3>As Italy\u2019s coronavirus infections ticked <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above 400 cases</span> and deaths hit the double digits, the leader of the governing Democratic Party posted a picture of himself clinking glasses for \u201can aperitivo in Milan,\u201d urging people \u201cnot to change our habits.\u201d\nThat was on Feb.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Not<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 days</span></span> later, as the toll <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hit 5,883 infections</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 233 dead</span>, the party boss, Nicola Zingaretti, posted a new video, this time informing Italy that he, too, had the virus.\nItaly now has more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 53,000 recorded</span> infections and more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 4,800 dead</span>, and the rate of increase keeps growing, with more than half the cases and fatalities coming in the past week.

Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting pandemic.\nThe government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in Lombardy, the northern region at the center of the outbreak, where bodies have piled up in churches. On Friday night, the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.\nThe tragedy of Italy now stands as a warning to its European neighbors and the United States, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. If Italy\u2019s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion \u2014 when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.\n</span>Italy\u2019s piecemeal attempts to cut it off \u2014 isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown \u2014 always lagged behind the virus\u2019s lethal trajectory.\n\u201cNow we are running after it,\u201d said Sandra Zampa, the under secretary at the Ministry of Health, who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had. \u201cWe closed gradually, as Europe is doing.

He said that the mixed messages from Rome and the easing of restrictions had led Italians to believe \u201cthat everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to.\u201d\nHe said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,\u201d said Mr. Fontana.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 billion</span> euro ($28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn\u2019t.\n</span>Ms. Zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of V\u00f2, the virus epicenter of the Veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the Codogno outbreak.\nShe said that the health minister, Mr. Speranza, and Mr. Conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In a <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surprise 2 a</span>.m. news conference on <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 8,</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">when 7,375 people</span> had already tested positive for coronavirus <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 366 had</span> died, Mr. Conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country\u2019s economic engine.\n</span>\u201cWe are facing an emergency,\u201d Mr. Conte said at the time. \u201cA national emergency.\u201d\nA draft of the decree, leaked to Italian media on Saturday night, pushed many Milan residents to rush to the train station in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.\nYet the following day, most Italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.\nTo clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued \u201cauto-certification\u201d forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or \u201cother\u201d necessities.\nIn the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self quarantine. Others didn\u2019t.\nThe broader restrictions in Lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on Codogno and other \u201cred zone\u201d towns linked to the original outbreak. Checkpoints disappeared. Local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.\nThree days later, on <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 11,</span> when the positive cases <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 12,462 and</span> the death toll climbed <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 827,</span> Mr. Conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.\nBut by then, some experts say, it was already too late.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Local Experiments\nItaly is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians.</span> The staggering number of recent deaths \u2014 more <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,300 in</span> the last four days \u2014 are of people infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.\nRoberto Burioni, a prominent virologist at the San Raffaele University in Milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to \u201cthat behavior.\u201d\nThe government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. But on Saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.\nLeaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.\nOn Friday, Mr. Fontana complained that <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 114 troops</span> the government deployed were insignificant, and that at <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 1,000 should</span> be sent. He said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and \u201capply rigid measures.\u201d\n\u201cMy idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,\u201d he said.\nHis political ally, Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, pre-empted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that Rome needed to enforce \u201ca more drastic isolation,\u201d including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.\n\u201cWalks should be banned,\u201d he said.\nMr. Zaia has some credibility on the issue. As new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in V\u00f2, a town of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 3,000 people</span> that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country\u2019s first coronavirus death.\nSome government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. But Mr. Zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. The government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.\n\u201cAt least this slows down the virus\u2019 speed,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. \u2018\u2018And slowing down the virus\u2019 speed allows the hospitals to breathe.\u2019\u2019\nIf not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.\nAmericans and others, he said, \u201cneed to be ready.\u201d"}, "57262": {"id": "57262", "text": "<h3>Wealth Income Gap Widens In U.S. Communities With Jackson Hole At The Top</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">To the surprise of few people, the wealth income gap among American communities is yawning ever wider, a new study has found.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">What might startle some, though, is that Teton County, home of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, boasts the highest income from assets in the nation.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">In fact, several other scenic mountain getaway communities in the West have become \u201cenclaves of extreme wealth ... peppered across the landscape,\u201d noted the study released last week by the Economic Innovation Group.</span> The wealth often sharply contrasts with desperately poor rural communities that are nearby.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Teton County, home of the Grand Teton National Park and popular ski slopes, has increasingly attracted the uber-rich, boosting the area\u2019s annual per capita asset income to an eye-<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">popping $161,400,</span> EIG found.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">(Jackson Hole has also led the nation in per capita income, boasting an average <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $250,000 per</span> resident <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>)\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Not faring nearly so well at the opposite end of the spectrum in an \u201casset desert\u201d is Ogala Lakota County \u2014 with <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just $2,800 in</span> asset income per capita, a third of the national average.</span> The county is entirely within the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ironically, Federal Reserve officials are meeting virtually this week to discuss \u201cMacroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy\u201d for their annual Jackson Hole Symposium.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The EIG report \u2014 which focused specifically on income from interest, stock dividends and rent \u2014 discovered that the gap between counties with the lowest and highest asset income per capita increased sixfold <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1990 and</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And asset income has become more geographically concentrated: It nearly doubled <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1990 in</span> the <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 10% of</span> counties, but barely changed for the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">bottom 90% of</span> counties.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The report demonstrates that while asset values may soar, they are only enjoyed by a fraction of Americans, while the rest must depend on wages.</span> \u201cThe reality is this: building asset wealth is currently unattainable for the majority of Americans,\u201d the report stated.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">EIG Research Director Kenan Fikri pointed out that the pandemic in particular has \u201cunderscored the divide in financial security and well-being between the Americans who own assets and those who do not.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Income from assets \u2014 a measure of wealth that excludes wages as well as government assistance programs \u2014 makes up about a fifth of personal income nationwide.</span> But only a minority of Americans have assets beyond homes, cars and retirement savings. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 15% of</span> households own stocks, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 13% hold</span> business equity or other residential property, according to Federal Reserve data.\n</span>Beyond Jackson Hole, per capita assets have skyrocketed in places like Manhattan, Westchester and Nassau in New York, and California\u2019s Palm Beach and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Critchlow wrote in \u201cPhyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman\u2019s Crusade\u201d (2005).\nWithout her and her followers, Mr. Critchlow said, the conservative intellectuals, research organizations and foundations that are often credited with reshaping the contours of American politics might have failed.\nThe conservative theorist and organizer Paul Weyrich said that Mrs. Schlafly \u201cdressed up the conservative movement for success at a time when absolutely no one thought we could win.\u201d\nEven liberals conceded her impact. \u201cIf political influence consists in transforming this huge and cantankerous country in one\u2019s preferred direction,\u201d the political scientist Alan Wolfe wrote in The New Republic <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span></span> \u201cSchlafly has to be regarded as one of the two or three most important Americans of the last half of the 20th century\u201d \u2014 although he hastened to add that \u201cevery idea she ever had was scatterbrained, dangerous and hateful.\u201d\nFor all her political heft, it was Phyllis Schlafly the person who often animated discussion. With her pearls, perfect posture and Daughters of the American Revolution pedigree, she basked in depictions of herself as the perfect wife and mother. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">She let it drop that she breast-fed all six of her babies and that she had taught all her children to read before they started school.\n</span>Feminists said it was her husband\u2019s wealth \u2014 he was a lawyer from a rich Illinois family \u2014 that had liberated her to politick.\nHer energy was formidable. She wrote or edited more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 books</span>, published an influential monthly newsletter beginning <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1967,</span> appeared daily on <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 500 radio</span> stations and delivered regular commentaries on CBS television in the 1970s and CNN in the \u201980s. <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1972,</span> she formed a volunteer organization called Stop ERA, which three years later became the Eagle Forum, to coordinate her campaigns.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1975,</span> when she was living in Alton, Ill., Mrs. Schlafly announced to her family at dinner that she was going to enter law school at Washington University in nearby St. Louis. Her husband, by her account, disapproved of the idea at first, and she abandoned it, only to resurrect it when he changed his mind.\nShe received her law degree <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1978,</span> ranked 27th in a class <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 186,</span> and passed the Illinois bar a few months later.\nSome opponents called Mrs. Schlafly a hypocrite for pursuing so energetic a career while championing traditional female roles. She replied by calling her political career \u201ca hobby\u201d and saying she would never offer an opinion on whether women should or should not work outside the home.\nOther detractors, like Karen DeCrow, a former president of the National Organization for Women, praised Mrs. Schlafly even as they castigated her politics.\n\u201cShe\u2019s an extremely liberated woman,\u201d Ms. DeCrow said in an interview with Carol Felsenthal for her book \u201cThe Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly\u201d (1981). \u201cShe sets out to do something and she does it. To me, that\u2019s liberation.\u201dContinue reading the main story\nStill, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s pronouncements drove her antagonists to distraction, though they suspected that her biting language was calculated precisely to provoke their outrage. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">She said that \u201csexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women\u201d and that \u201csex-education classes are like in-home sales parties for abortions.\u201d</span> She called the atom bomb \u201ca marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God.\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1980,</span> a protester threw an apple pie in her face at a Women\u2019s National Republican Club reception in New York, painfully scratching an eye.\nBut Mrs. Schlafly was never outwardly ruffled. When Ms. Freidan, during a debate at Indiana University <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> recommended that she burn at the stake, Mrs. Schlafly replied in an even voice that she was pleased Ms. Friedan had said that because, she said, the comment had made it plain to the audience just how intolerant \u201cintemperate, agitating proponents of the E.R.A.\u201d were.\nStaunch G.O.P. Roots\nShe was born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart on Aug.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15,</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1924,</span> in St. Louis, the oldest of two daughters of the former Odile Dodge, a teacher with two college degrees, and John Bruce Stewart, a machinist and industrial equipment salesman who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his wife\u2019s senior.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Fired by Westinghouse at the onset of the Depression, Mr. Stewart was never quite able to put the family\u2019s finances back together.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1944,</span> he won a patent for a rotary car engine, of the type the Japanese automaker Mazda later sold, but it went nowhere.\nDespite his hardships, Mr. Stewart remained a staunch Republican, fiercely opposed to the New Deal.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Mrs. Stewart, who was ambitious for her daughters, supported the family with a series of jobs: department store saleswoman, elementary school teacher and librarian at the St. Louis Art Museum.</span> In her spare time, she wrote a book on the history of St. Louis.\nMs. Felsenthal suggested in her book that Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s impatience with women who denigrated homemaking stemmed in part from her mother\u2019s wish that she could have kept house and worked for good causes rather than report for work six days a week.\nPhyllis Stewart attended Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis (now Maryville University) and transferred to Washington University. She had no time for friends, dates or sororities, she wrote; instead, as a student, she worked nights at a munitions factory test-firing guns.\nEven so, she managed to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in only three years, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 19.</span> She won a scholarship to study political science at Radcliffe, and earned a master\u2019s degree there in nine months.\nHer politics were middle of the road at first. <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1940,</span> she supported the moderate Republican Wendell Willkie in his bid to deny President Franklin D. Roosevelt a third term, and in graduate school she wrote papers supporting an active United Nations. Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">When no government jobs turned up, she found a spot at a conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Association, the forerunner of the American Enterprise Institute.</span> Educating herself in conservative philosophy, she submitted articles against the New Deal to Redbook and other magazines, but they were rejected.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1946,</span> she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell, a Republican. After that, she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and, <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 24,</span> met John Fred Schlafly Jr., a 39-year-old lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct.<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20,</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1949.</span>\nAt the ceremony, Mrs. Schlafly said, she did not promise to obey, only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife, even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel, writing, speaking and campaigning after her oldest child <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">turned 18 months</span>.\n\u201cI want to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me come here\u201d was a favorite opening for speeches. (\u201cI like to say that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know it irritates women\u2019s libbers more than anything else.\u201d)\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs.</span> \u201cPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s formula for the better life, then, is based on marrying a rich professional, climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her,\u201d Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1980.</span>\nMrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1952,</span> after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down, Mrs. Schlafly, who <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27,</span> volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election.\nThat experience, she said, helped her overcome her natural shyness, and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1956 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1964.</span>\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1958,</span> she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation \u2014 named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists \u2014 to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1962,</span> she hosted a 15-minute radio show on national security called \u201cAmerica Wake Up.\u201d It was carried <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 25 Illinois</span> stations.\nThe Schlaflys\u2019 politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism, not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.\nMany members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members.\u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign. In her self-published pocket-size book promoting his candidacy, \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by \u201csecret kingmakers.\u201d By some estimates, the book sold as many <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 3.5 million</span> copies.\nWriting in The New Yorker <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span></span> Elizabeth Kolbert said the book \u201cmixed fact, sensational accusations, commonsensical truths, and elaborate conspiracy theories into a compelling but evidently bogus narrative.\u201d\nMrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> and <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1967 she</span> lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress, from another Illinois district, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> also ended in defeat.\nTargeting the E.R.A.\nDuring much of the 1960s and \u201970s, Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues, often working with Chester Ward, a retired Navy admiral. Their \u201cKissinger on the Couch\u201d (1975) begins with a proposition: \u201cSuppose that Henry Kissinger is, in the common parlance, \u2018some kind of nut or something.\u2019\u201d In more <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800 pages</span>, they argued that he was.\nMrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it, as \u201csomething between innocuous and mildly helpful,\u201d she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when, in <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 1971,</span> a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.\nThe next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women \u2014 guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance \u2014 would be jettisoned.\n\u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Mrs. Schlafly told The Times <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span> \u201cI knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband\u2019s permission to make wine.\u201d\nProponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.\nUnwelcome Revelation\nMrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values.\nAfter her husband died <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993,</span> Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonial-style house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.\nMrs. Schlafly is survived by six children,<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 grandchildren</span> and three great-grandchildren.\nHer son John gained attention <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 when</span> a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe.\u201d\n(John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.)\nMrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies. Even as supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to revive it, Mrs. Schlafly strove to make sure it stayed dead.\nIn March of this year, she endorsed Donald J.

Angered by the cultural transformations of the 1960s, beginning with <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1962 Supreme</span> Court ruling prohibiting state-sponsored prayer in public schools, her \u201clittle old ladies in tennis shoes,\u201d as some called them, went from ringing doorbells for Goldwater to serving as foot soldiers for the \u201cReagan revolution.\u201d\n\u201cSchlafly had discovered a genuine populist sentiment in a large female population that opposed the E.R.A., feminism and modern liberalism with the same intensity of emotion that feminists brought to their cause,\u201d Donald T. Critchlow wrote in \u201cPhyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman\u2019s Crusade\u201d (2005).\nWithout her and her followers, Mr. Critchlow said, the conservative intellectuals, research organizations and foundations that are often credited with reshaping the contours of American politics might have failed.\nThe conservative theorist and organizer Paul Weyrich said that Mrs. Schlafly \u201cdressed up the conservative movement for success at a time when absolutely no one thought we could win.\u201d\nEven liberals conceded her impact. \u201cIf political influence consists in transforming this huge and cantankerous country in one\u2019s preferred direction,\u201d the political scientist Alan Wolfe wrote in The New Republic <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span></span> \u201cSchlafly has to be regarded as one of the two or three most important Americans of the last half of the 20th century\u201d \u2014 although he hastened to add that \u201cevery idea she ever had was scatterbrained, dangerous and hateful.\u201d\nFor all her political heft, it was Phyllis Schlafly the person who often animated discussion. With her pearls, perfect posture and Daughters of the American Revolution pedigree, she basked in depictions of herself as the perfect wife and mother. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">She let it drop that she breast-fed all six of her babies and that she had taught all her children to read before they started school.\n</span>Feminists said it was her husband\u2019s wealth \u2014 he was a lawyer from a rich Illinois family \u2014 that had liberated her to politick.\nHer energy was formidable. She wrote or edited more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 books</span>, published an influential monthly newsletter beginning <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1967,</span> appeared daily on <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 500 radio</span> stations and delivered regular commentaries on CBS television in the 1970s and CNN in the \u201980s. <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1972,</span> she formed a volunteer organization called Stop ERA, which three years later became the Eagle Forum, to coordinate her campaigns.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1975,</span> when she was living in Alton, Ill., Mrs. Schlafly announced to her family at dinner that she was going to enter law school at Washington University in nearby St. Louis. Her husband, by her account, disapproved of the idea at first, and she abandoned it, only to resurrect it when he changed his mind.\nShe received her law degree <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1978,</span> ranked 27th in a class <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 186,</span> and passed the Illinois bar a few months later.\nSome opponents called Mrs. Schlafly a hypocrite for pursuing so energetic a career while championing traditional female roles. She replied by calling her political career \u201ca hobby\u201d and saying she would never offer an opinion on whether women should or should not work outside the home.\nOther detractors, like Karen DeCrow, a former president of the National Organization for Women, praised Mrs. Schlafly even as they castigated her politics.\n\u201cShe\u2019s an extremely liberated woman,\u201d Ms. DeCrow said in an interview with Carol Felsenthal for her book \u201cThe Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly\u201d (1981). \u201cShe sets out to do something and she does it. To me, that\u2019s liberation.\u201dContinue reading the main story\nStill, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s pronouncements drove her antagonists to distraction, though they suspected that her biting language was calculated precisely to provoke their outrage. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">She said that \u201csexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women\u201d and that \u201csex-education classes are like in-home sales parties for abortions.\u201d</span> She called the atom bomb \u201ca marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God.\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1980,</span> a protester threw an apple pie in her face at a Women\u2019s National Republican Club reception in New York, painfully scratching an eye.\nBut Mrs. Schlafly was never outwardly ruffled. When Ms. Freidan, during a debate at Indiana University <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> recommended that she burn at the stake, Mrs. Schlafly replied in an even voice that she was pleased Ms. Friedan had said that because, she said, the comment had made it plain to the audience just how intolerant \u201cintemperate, agitating proponents of the E.R.A.\u201d were.\nStaunch G.O.P.

She had no time for friends, dates or sororities, she wrote; instead, as a student, she worked nights at a munitions factory test-firing guns.\nEven so, she managed to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in only three years, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 19.</span> She won a scholarship to study political science at Radcliffe, and earned a master\u2019s degree there in nine months.\nHer politics were middle of the road at first. <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1940,</span> she supported the moderate Republican Wendell Willkie in his bid to deny President Franklin D. Roosevelt a third term, and in graduate school she wrote papers supporting an active United Nations. Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">When no government jobs turned up, she found a spot at a conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Association, the forerunner of the American Enterprise Institute.</span> Educating herself in conservative philosophy, she submitted articles against the New Deal to Redbook and other magazines, but they were rejected.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1946,</span> she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell, a Republican. After that, she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and, <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 24,</span> met John Fred Schlafly Jr., a 39-year-old lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct.<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20,</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1949.</span>\nAt the ceremony, Mrs. Schlafly said, she did not promise to obey, only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife, even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel, writing, speaking and campaigning after her oldest child <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">turned 18 months</span>.\n\u201cI want to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me come here\u201d was a favorite opening for speeches. (\u201cI like to say that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know it irritates women\u2019s libbers more than anything else.\u201d)\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs.</span> \u201cPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s formula for the better life, then, is based on marrying a rich professional, climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her,\u201d Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1980.</span>\nMrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1952,</span> after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down, Mrs. Schlafly, who <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27,</span> volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election.\nThat experience, she said, helped her overcome her natural shyness, and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1956 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1964.</span>\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1958,</span> she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation \u2014 named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists \u2014 to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1962,</span> she hosted a 15-minute radio show on national security called \u201cAmerica Wake Up.\u201d It was carried <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 25 Illinois</span> stations.\nThe Schlaflys\u2019 politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism, not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.\nMany members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members.\u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign. In her self-published pocket-size book promoting his candidacy, \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by \u201csecret kingmakers.\u201d By some estimates, the book sold as many <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 3.5 million</span> copies.\nWriting in The New Yorker <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005,</span></span> Elizabeth Kolbert said the book \u201cmixed fact, sensational accusations, commonsensical truths, and elaborate conspiracy theories into a compelling but evidently bogus narrative.\u201d\nMrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1964,</span></span></span> and <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1967 she</span> lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress, from another Illinois district, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> also ended in defeat.\nTargeting the E.R.A.\nDuring much of the 1960s and \u201970s, Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues, often working with Chester Ward, a retired Navy admiral. Their \u201cKissinger on the Couch\u201d (1975) begins with a proposition: \u201cSuppose that Henry Kissinger is, in the common parlance, \u2018some kind of nut or something.\u2019\u201d In more <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800 pages</span>, they argued that he was.\nMrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it, as \u201csomething between innocuous and mildly helpful,\u201d she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when, in <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 1971,</span> a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.\nThe next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women \u2014 guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance \u2014 would be jettisoned.\n\u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Mrs. Schlafly told The Times <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006.</span> \u201cI knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband\u2019s permission to make wine.\u201d\nProponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.\nUnwelcome Revelation\nMrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span></span> an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values.\nAfter her husband died <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993,</span> Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonial-style house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.\nMrs. Schlafly is survived by six children,<span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 grandchildren</span> and three great-grandchildren.\nHer son John gained attention <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 when</span> a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe.\u201d\n(John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.)\nMrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies.

XONE -0.04%decrease; red down pointing triangle President David Burns and the heady 3-D printing industry is managing expectations, including his own.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Last year, Mr. Burns predicted <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 80% increase</span> in sales for ExOne, which makes 3-D printers.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Then in January, ExOne said sales growth, while strong, would be about half that amount due to deferred orders.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">ExOne's stock has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fallen 46% since</span>.\n\n</span>\"That was a mistake to have been that aggressive,\" said Mr. Burns, who remains optimistic.\n\nPatience and potential are often at odds in 3-D manufacturing, a potentially transformative process that allows complex and precision manufacturing while bypassing certain production steps.\n\nThe process involves taking a digital image of an object and slicing it into thousands of layers. The image is then transferred to a printer, which creates a three-dimensional object by producing each layer in plastic, metal, sand or other materials.\n\nRetailers <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sell $1,500 3</span>-D printers that can make toys and jewelry. More advanced printers, selling <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $500,000 each</span>, make metal pump parts for the U.S. Navy, titanium knee joints and plastic ear pieces for hearing aids. Ford Motor Co. engineers use 3-D printers to make some prototype parts.\n\n\"Every week, if not every day, somebody walks into my office and says: 'You should be 3-D printing this out of that material,\" said Mr. Burns, a Rochester, N.Y., native, who managed machine shops before helping launch ExOne <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005 here</span> in western Pennsylvania. \"It's easy to get distracted.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nStock prices for some 3-D printing companies more than doubled <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> while world-wide revenue increased a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">smaller 27% to</span> an <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $2.8 billion</span> last year, according to consultancy Wohlers Associates Inc. in Colorado.</span> 3-D stocks though are off to a rough start this year with industry leaders 3D Systems Corp. <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DDD 1.66</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 40% and</span> Stratasys Ltd.

But the printers aren't yet capable of an industrial revolution.\"\n\nHe and other analysts say the printers need to be faster and cheaper to replace traditional techniques that cut, stamp, grind or cast metal into finished objects.\n\nThe biggest current advantage of 3-D printers: flexibility and complexity. ExOne's printers made a pump impeller for the Navy as a single unit, the company said. Before, it was assembled <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 13 parts</span>.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">ExOne is pursuing a risky industrial-only strategy focused on making metal objects\u2014no plastic\u2014in a bet that it will dominate a market for metal printers that is still in its infancy.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\"They've got an attractive position in the [metal printer] market, but the question is will metals be an attractive market to have an attractive position in,\" said Holden Lewis, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets.\n\n</span>Although ExOne does have some big customers, including Caterpillar Inc. and United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky helicopter unit.<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">, its sales last year <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $39.5 million</span>, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 38% increase</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2012.</span></span> Heavy expenses for production and technology development contributed to <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $6.5 million</span> loss last year, an improvement from <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.2 million</span> loss <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The company'<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $500 million</span> market capitalization is dwarfed by <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $5.7 billion</span> market cap for bigger rivals 3-D Systems <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $5.4 billion</span> for Stratasys.\n\n</span>ExOne printers use silica sand for creating molds for metal castings or powdered metal, such as stainless steel or bronze, that are mixed with a glue-type binder to hold the particles together. The printer applies layer after layer during hours of production work. Once printed, the metal object goes into <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2,300</span>-degree furnace where metal particles are melted together.\n\nFord uses ExOne printers in design centers in North America and Europe to make molds for prototype engine and transmission parts, including the engine block for Ford's popular EcoBoost engine. It takes four days and <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs $3,000 to</span> print a 3-D prototype of an engine's air intake manifold, compared to four months <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $500,000 without</span> 3-D printing. Prototyped parts with 3-D printing can be easily enlarged or reduced by fractions of an inch and printed again.\n\n\"You're offering engineers a lot more flexibility\" with their component designs, said Harold Sears, additive manufacturing specialist at Ford. Printers can't yet produce finished parts in large enough volumes to install in cars and light trucks.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">3-D is making inroads in the market for hard-to-find replacement parts.</span> Contract manufacturer rp+m in Avon Lake, Ohio, uses an ExOne printer to make replacement parts from powdered tungsten for medical-imaging machines built by General Electric Co., Siemens AG and Philips NV. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">In many cases, the original suppliers have gone out of business and replacements parts must be built from scratch, usually in small quantities.\n\n</span>\"Companies order exactly what they need,\" said Matt Hlavin, chief executive of rp+m, which <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 13 3</span>-D printers made by multiple companies.\n\nSome 3-D customers want printed parts but aren't ready to invest in the printers themselves. Hydro Parts Solutions Inc. makes replacement parts for pumps and other equipment at oil refineries and chemical plants. \"The pumps are so old that no one has replacement parts for them,\" said co-owner Jeff Smith.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">His engineers create digital images of the broken or worn part and send it electronically to one of ExOne's seven job shops.</span> There, the printer creates a mold, which has as many <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 11,000 layers</span>, in less <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 24 hours</span>. The mold is used to cast a new metal part. In the past, this process took more than six weeks and the resulting molds weren't as precise and detailed.\n\n\"You can control the shape much better with 3-D,\" said Mr. Smith who ran a foundry <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 20 years</span> before launching Hydro Parts.\n\nWrite to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "23953": {"id": "23953", "text": "<h3>Putin: Russia\u2019s economy can rebound stronger from Western sanctions</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">MOSCOW \u2014 In a measure of Russia\u2019s grinding economic difficulties, President Vladimir Putin on Thursday devoted the bulk of an annual call-in program to assuring his nation that life would soon improve after a year of confrontation with the West.\n</span>The highly choreographed show is a barometer of the message the Kremlin wants to deliver to the nation.\nLast year\u2019s edition had a triumphant tone as Putin exulted in the annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But the president this time took a far more conciliatory approach over nearly four hours on the air as he answered questions about rising prices, the falling ruble and Russia\u2019s economic prospects.\n</span>Putin also defended Russia\u2019s decision to greenlight plans to send an advanced air defense missile system to Iran, saying it does not contradict international sanctions against Tehran and poses no threat to Israel.\n[Read: The Russian ruble is rebounding \u2014 but can this last?]\nFor Ukraine, he said he wanted to work with Ukrainian authorities to resolve the burning conflict and held back from calling for the independence of a region held by pro-Moscow separatists.\nOverall, the image that Russians received from the marathon performance was of a leader confident in his control and promising better times as Russia works to boost its independence from global markets.\n[Are sanctions against Russia working?]\nMore <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 million</span> Russians were said to have sent inquiries to the call-in show, which was heavily promoted on Russia\u2019s state-run television networks.\nPutin told viewers that he expected sanctions against Russia to last for years.

the economy is weak.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Here are five charts that highlight the differences in the two economies.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Economic Growth\n\nFirst, overall economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe since mid-2017.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">While growth faltered in the eurozone beginning in the first quarter <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2018,</span> it has remained solid in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nA central bank\u2019s main job is to maintain slow and steady

level close to but just under<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%.</span></span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Inflation has been weak in both economies lately but it has come closer to the Fed\u2019s goal.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Manufacturing\n\nThe global economic slowdown has had a bigger effect on manufacturing in the eurozone, which is more export-driven.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">That has contributed to Europe\u2019s weakening economy and helped spur the ECB\u2019s latest move.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Borrowing Costs\n\nFaced with the sluggish economy, European investors are seeking safety in European government bonds, pushing up their prices.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">That, combined with the large portfolio the ECB has accumulated through its asset purchases, has pulled yields in several eurozone countries into negative territory, well below the yield on U.S. government debt.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Currencies\n\nThe stronger U.S. economy has attracted investment from overseas.</span> That has pushed up the value of the dollar against other currencies, including the euro.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">President Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more to weaken the dollar, which would benefit American exporters.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He pressed the Fed in a tweet Wednesday to cut short-term rates to \u201c\u201cZERO, or less.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But the relatively solid U.S. economy means that could be risky.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">It could cause the economy to overheat and inflate dangerous asset bubbles that might burst and harm the economy.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this month the U.S. economy \u201cis in a good place,\u201d adding that the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to keep the expansion going.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience means the Fed is

sits.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Fed cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point in July and is poised to do so again next week, which would lower the rate to a range <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%.</span></span> That would be well above the ECB\u2019s key rate, which will drop to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">minus 0.5%.</span>\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Behind this divergence: The U.S. economy is stronger than the eurozone\u2019s, which means there is less reason for the Fed to boost growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s not an enviable situation to be in to have negative interest rates,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cEurope has negative rates because the economy is weak.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Here are five charts that highlight the differences in the two economies.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Economic Growth\n\nFirst, overall economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe since mid-2017.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">While growth faltered in the eurozone beginning in the first quarter <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2018,</span> it has remained solid in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nA central bank\u2019s main job is to maintain slow and steady inflation to keep the economy humming along.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The Fed targets <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2% rate</span> while the ECB seeks a level close to but just under<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%.</span></span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Inflation has been weak in both economies lately but it has come closer to the Fed\u2019s goal.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Manufacturing\n\nThe global economic slowdown has had a bigger effect on manufacturing in the eurozone, which is more export-driven.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">That has contributed to Europe\u2019s weakening economy and helped spur the ECB\u2019s latest move.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Borrowing Costs\n\nFaced with the sluggish economy, European investors are seeking safety in European government bonds, pushing up their prices.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">That, combined with the large portfolio the ECB has accumulated through its asset purchases, has pulled yields in several eurozone countries into negative territory, well below the yield on U.S. government debt.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Currencies\n\nThe stronger U.S. economy has attracted investment from overseas.</span> That has pushed up the value of the dollar against other currencies, including the euro.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">President Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more to weaken the dollar, which would benefit American exporters.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He pressed the Fed in a tweet Wednesday to cut short-term rates to \u201c\u201cZERO, or less.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But the relatively solid U.S. economy means that could be risky.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">It could cause the economy to overheat and inflate dangerous asset bubbles that might burst and harm the economy.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this month the U.S. economy \u201cis in a good place,\u201d adding that the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to keep the expansion going.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience means the Fed is unlikely to push rates below zero soon.\n\n</span>Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\"

The agency was working on an update, as requested by the city, when Hurricane Sandy hit.\nA month later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane.\nThe audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone.\nIn the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.\n</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.\nIndeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact. One recent federal report estimated there was <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 40 percent</span> \u201cuncertainty of flood predictions.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA\u2019s proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation \u2014 the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood \u2014 by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, \u201cunnecessarily putting <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately 26,000 buildings</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 170,000 residents</span>\u201d in higher-risk locations and \u201ccausing an affordability challenge.\u201d\nIn March, at the city\u2019s request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps\u2019 potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The report found that the proposed maps could \u201creduce property values, increase loan defaults, lower tax revenue, and create hardships for current residents.</span>\u201dContinue reading the main story\nOne area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2013 proposal</span></span>, the difference for the area is stark: <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Just 26 buildings</span> were in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1983 FEMA</span> flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 5,000 buildings</span>.\nCanarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But in a neighborhood that weathered the city\u2019s highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have \u201clittle to put toward mitigating their flood risk,\u201d according to a city report released in May.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor\u2019s Office of Storm Recovery.</span> By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established.\nWith such coverage, premiums would probably be <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $500 a</span> year; without it, the annual rates could <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be $3,000.</span>\nBut <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">even $500 a</span> year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood.\nOn Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA\u2019s flood zones. If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone.\n\u201cIf you get flood insurance, you can\u2019t pay your other bills,\u201d he said.\nTheresa Fraser lives on Canarsie Road, a half mile from Jamaica Bay. About two feet of water rushed into her basement during Hurricane Sandy.\nAfter seeking advice from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that created a flood mapping tool, she purchased flood insurance to qualify for FEMA disaster funds. But Ms. Fraser, a day-care teacher, dropped it after a year because she could not afford <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $600 annual</span> premium.\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to be in a high-risk zone, but I don\u2019t want to move,\u201d said Ms. Fraser, a Guyanese immigrant who moved into her <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">house 20 years</span> ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t always run from one place to the next because you\u2019re worried things will happen.\u201d\nOne clue to the possible contours of any future maps may be found in a single column buried in the city\u2019<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2015 appeal</span>.\nThe city estimated that if the scientific errors were removed from FEMA\u2019s revision, the number of people in the flood zone could increase <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 6 percent</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 230,000 over</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1983 maps</span>, and the number of one- to four-family buildings could grow <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 38 percent</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 36,000.</span> Both increases would be much smaller than <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 100 percent</span> jumps suggested by FEMA\u2019s initial maps.Continue reading the main story\nThe Most Vulnerable ZIP Code\nWhen homeowners suffer flood damage, they file claims. And of <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 116 properties</span> in New York City that have filed multiple FEMA claims in the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 20 years</span>, more than a quarter have not been in the flood zone, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nTwo areas have had the most properties with repeat flood claims. One is Broad Channel, in Queens.\nThe other is <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10465 ZIP</span> code in the Bronx, in the shadow of the Throgs Neck Bridge, home to Edgewater Park.\nEdgewater Park is a tightknit and predominantly white community that feels more like a seaside village than a city neighborhood. But its beauty is also a burden, explained Deborah A. Roff, president of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1992,</span> a nor\u2019easter nearly drowned the neighborhood. Then there was the concussive trifecta of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Sandy <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2011 to</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> strewing debris far inland and leaving gashes in houses that remain uninhabitable.\nBut now, what really worries Ms. Roff and her neighbors is not the next storm, but the federal government.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even afraid of the storms, because with the flood, you can pray \u2014 \u2018Jesus, please don\u2019t let the flood come,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Roff. \u201cThey\u2019re more afraid of the regulations and the flood insurance because they\u2019re getting the bill, and they\u2019ve got to pay that bill.\u201d\nThe various maps that the residents have used to determine the flood boundaries \u2014 whether from FEMA, the Department of City Planning or other sources \u2014 offer conflicting results about whether a house is in the flood plain, Ms. Roff said. On her own block of bungalows, she said, one homeowner <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pays $5,000 a</span> year in premiums. A few doors down, another does not have insurance. Just beyond that, a new homeowner is <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spending $300,000 to</span> raise a <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">house 20 feet</span> like \u201ca castle in the sky,\u201d she said, thereby avoiding paying any insurance.\nBy working with the City Planning department to allow for more flood-resilient construction and investment, to be paid for, at least in part, by higher maintenance fees, Ms. Roff hopes to minimize the community\u2019s risks, even if it means that its residents have to pay more.\n\u201cFair is fair \u2014 we don\u2019t want to hurt anyone else by fixing this issue,\u201d she said.Continue reading the main story\nA Difference of Two Feet\nWhile the maps are probably years away, the process has already influenced how the city builds, especially along a waterfront that has become more accessible yet more expensive.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> the value of property within the 100-year floodplain <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was $58.7 billion</span>, according to a report by Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">By 2014,</span> that value had climbed <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $129.1 billion</span>, making it more urgent to invest in resiliency projects, Mr. Stringer concluded.\nMoreover, FEMA\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2013 proposal</span></span> to expand the flood maps applies to all new or substantially improved buildings. That means more buildings are now subject to tougher building codes enacted after Hurricane Sandy.\nSome residential and commercial developers are embracing the standards as a vital long-term investment.\nOne such project is Greenpoint Landing in Brooklyn, an 11-building, 22-acre development that will <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">add 5,500 apartments</span> on a former industrial site. The project, now under construction, features a terraced esplanade park that rises like steps from the East River, which will be filled with absorbent material to protect against storm surges, high winds and more.\nUltimately, the project will raise the waterfront by about three to five feet above the existing coastline, said Karen Tamir, principal with James Corner Field Operations, a landscape architecture and urban planning firm that is designing the project.Continue reading the main story\nIn October, the Waterfront Alliance, a coalition that works to protect New York\u2019s waterways and shoreline, said that the project had satisfied the alliance\u2019s Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines, a new ratings system reminiscent of the LEED certification program for green buildings.\n\u201cIf you bake the retrofit into your costs now, it\u2019s a marginal investment, and it protects your property and, more importantly, the people who will live there,\u201d said Roland Lewis, the alliance\u2019s president and chief executive.\nIn some cases, however, the reaction has been to get out of the flood zone, in any possible way.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Consider a project in TriBeCa to convert a 10-story office building <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 11 Beach</span> Street into luxury condominiums priced at up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> apiece.\n</span>Constructed <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1900,</span> the building was outside the original FEMA flood zones.

But city officials said that was not the case.\nSo the architects proposed an ingenious solution: slice two feet off the bottom corner of the building.\nAfter consulting with FEMA, the city ultimately concluded that the proposal \u201cshall absolve the applicant from complying.\u201dContinue reading the main story", "displayed_text": "<h3>In New York, Drawing Flood Maps Is a \u2018Game of Inches\u2019</h3>With <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 520 miles</span> of coastline and thousands of acres of waterfront development, New York has more residents living in high-risk flood zones than any other city in the country.

If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone.\n\u201cIf you get flood insurance, you can\u2019t pay your other bills,\u201d he said.\nTheresa Fraser lives on Canarsie Road, a half mile from Jamaica Bay. About two feet of water rushed into her basement during Hurricane Sandy.\nAfter seeking advice from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that created a flood mapping tool, she purchased flood insurance to qualify for FEMA disaster funds.

One is Broad Channel, in Queens.\nThe other is <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10465 ZIP</span> code in the Bronx, in the shadow of the Throgs Neck Bridge, home to Edgewater Park.\nEdgewater Park is a tightknit and predominantly white community that feels more like a seaside village than a city neighborhood. But its beauty is also a burden, explained Deborah A. Roff, president of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1992,</span> a nor\u2019easter nearly drowned the neighborhood. Then there was the concussive trifecta of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Sandy <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2011 to</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012,</span> strewing debris far inland and leaving gashes in houses that remain uninhabitable.\nBut now, what really worries Ms. Roff and her neighbors is not the next storm, but the federal government.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even afraid of the storms, because with the flood, you can pray \u2014 \u2018Jesus, please don\u2019t let the flood come,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Roff. \u201cThey\u2019re more afraid of the regulations and the flood insurance because they\u2019re getting the bill, and they\u2019ve got to pay that bill.\u201d\nThe various maps that the residents have used to determine the flood boundaries \u2014 whether from FEMA, the Department of City Planning or other sources \u2014 offer conflicting results about whether a house is in the flood plain, Ms. Roff said. On her own block of bungalows, she said, one homeowner <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pays $5,000 a</span> year in premiums. A few doors down, another does not have insurance. Just beyond that, a new homeowner is <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spending $300,000 to</span> raise a <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">house 20 feet</span> like \u201ca castle in the sky,\u201d she said, thereby avoiding paying any insurance.\nBy working with the City Planning department to allow for more flood-resilient construction and investment, to be paid for, at least in part, by higher maintenance fees, Ms. Roff hopes to minimize the community\u2019s risks, even if it means that its residents have to pay more.\n\u201cFair is fair \u2014 we don\u2019t want to hurt anyone else by fixing this issue,\u201d she said.Continue reading the main story\nA Difference of Two Feet\nWhile the maps are probably years away, the process has already influenced how the city builds, especially along a waterfront that has become more accessible yet more expensive.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> the value of property within the 100-year floodplain <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was $58.7 billion</span>, according to a report by Scott M.

That means more buildings are now subject to tougher building codes enacted after Hurricane Sandy.\nSome residential and commercial developers are embracing the standards as a vital long-term investment.\nOne such project is Greenpoint Landing in Brooklyn, an 11-building, 22-acre development that will <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">add 5,500 apartments</span> on a former industrial site. The project, now under construction, features a terraced esplanade park that rises like steps from the East River, which will be filled with absorbent material to protect against storm surges, high winds and more.\nUltimately, the project will raise the waterfront by about three to five feet above the existing coastline, said Karen Tamir, principal with James Corner Field Operations, a landscape architecture and urban planning firm that is designing the project.Continue reading the main story\nIn October, the Waterfront Alliance, a coalition that works to protect New York\u2019s waterways and shoreline, said that the project had satisfied the alliance\u2019s Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines, a new ratings system reminiscent of the LEED certification program for green buildings.\n\u201cIf you bake the retrofit into your costs now, it\u2019s a marginal investment, and it protects your property and, more importantly, the people who will live there,\u201d said Roland Lewis, the alliance\u2019s president and chief executive.\nIn some cases, however, the reaction has been to get out of the flood zone, in any possible way.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Consider a project in TriBeCa to convert a 10-story office building <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 11 Beach</span> Street into luxury condominiums priced at up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> apiece.\n</span>Constructed <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1900,</span> the building was outside the original FEMA flood zones.

Words like \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.\nIt was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise\u2019s first World Series <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span>\nBut on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport\u2019s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.\nThe shock waves have been seismic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets \u2014 all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers\u2019 signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.\n</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing \u201cto determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.\u201d\nFor some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs.

The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that\u2019s been broken.\u201d\nSuspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.\nOn Oct.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees\u2019 Aroldis Chapman in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.\nYet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.\nIn the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros\u2019 acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.\nTaubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.\nHouston\u2019s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team\u2019s hierarchy and demoted Ryan\u2019s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.\n</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team\u2019s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher\u2019s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.\nOver the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s investigators <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.\nEven before The Athletic\u2019s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers\u2019 subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.\nBut they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston\u2019s hitters but sensed something shady.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cAs a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn\u2019t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.\u201d\nIt was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While power hitters generally strike out frequently \u2014 a trade-off for swinging aggressively \u2014 the Astros\u2019 lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 1910 through</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> only two teams \u2014 <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians \u2014 led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">both 2017 and</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,\u201d said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros\u2019 hitting coach, explaining the team\u2019s philosophy in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: \u201cIf you go in with that mind-set, you\u2019re not going to miss your pitch as often.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros\u2019 scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have \u2014 possibly costing players money and jobs.\n</span>\u201cNow you\u2019re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down\u201d to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, \u201cbecause they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?\u201d\nThe Astros\u2019 players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the players involved to step forward,\u201d the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. \u201cTake your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there\u2019s some integrity still in you somewhere.\u201d\nThe \u2018model organization\u2019 created a firestorm.\nThe Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros\u2019 owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.\nSome in the Astros\u2019 organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Luhnow, who has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team\u2019s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team\u2019s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cOne of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,\u201d he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> \u201cDepth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.\u201d\nLuhnow \u2014 who did not respond to an interview request for this article \u2014 inherited a team with the majors\u2019 worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.\n\u201cThe players couldn\u2019t understand why the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">best 25 guys</span> weren\u2019t breaking camp with us,\u201d said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span> \u201cWe tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we\u2019d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.\u201d\nEven before the N.B.A.\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word \u201cprocess\u201d as a euphemism for tanking \u2014 a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston\u2019s attendance sank <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team\u2019s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball\u2019s analytical and technological revolution.\n\u201cTo me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,\u201d said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros\u2019 radio play-by-play voice <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2006 through</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012.</span> \u201cThey brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.\u201d\nThe results began revealing themselves <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros\u2019 database had been hacked by the Cardinals\u2019 scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.\nCorrea eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.\nIn hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa \u2014 who declined an interview request \u2014 could not resist commenting. \u201cGuess who isn\u2019t surprised?\u201d he tweeted.\nBaseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros\u2019 explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before \u2014 as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.\nIn the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington\u2019s wins came at the Astros\u2019 park in Houston.\nSign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology.

But we know more now.\u201d\nDavid Waldstein and James Wagner contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball\u2019s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 111 losses</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.\nEverywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.\nIt was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise\u2019s first World Series <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span>\nBut on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport\u2019s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.\nThe shock waves have been seismic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets \u2014 all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers\u2019 signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.\n</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing \u201cto determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.\u201d\nFor some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 tweeted on Thursday: \u201cI would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.\u201d\nWood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.\n\u201cThe word that keeps popping into my mind is \u2018unfathomable,\u2019\u201d said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s me being na\u00efve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that\u2019s been broken.\u201d\nSuspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.\nOn Oct.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees\u2019 Aroldis Chapman in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.\nYet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.\nIn the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros\u2019 acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.\nTaubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.\nHouston\u2019s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team\u2019s hierarchy and demoted Ryan\u2019s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.\n</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team\u2019s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher\u2019s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.\nOver the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s investigators <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.\nEven before The Athletic\u2019s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers\u2019 subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.\nBut they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston\u2019s hitters but sensed something shady.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cAs a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn\u2019t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.\u201d\nIt was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While power hitters generally strike out frequently \u2014 a trade-off for swinging aggressively \u2014 the Astros\u2019 lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 1910 through</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> only two teams \u2014 <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians \u2014 led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">both 2017 and</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,\u201d said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros\u2019 hitting coach, explaining the team\u2019s philosophy in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: \u201cIf you go in with that mind-set, you\u2019re not going to miss your pitch as often.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros\u2019 scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have \u2014 possibly costing players money and jobs.\n</span>\u201cNow you\u2019re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down\u201d to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, \u201cbecause they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?\u201d\nThe Astros\u2019 players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the players involved to step forward,\u201d the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. \u201cTake your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there\u2019s some integrity still in you somewhere.\u201d\nThe \u2018model organization\u2019 created a firestorm.\nThe Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros\u2019 owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.\nSome in the Astros\u2019 organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Luhnow, who has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team\u2019s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team\u2019s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cOne of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,\u201d he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> \u201cDepth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.\u201d\nLuhnow \u2014 who did not respond to an interview request for this article \u2014 inherited a team with the majors\u2019 worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.\n\u201cThe players couldn\u2019t understand why the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">best 25 guys</span> weren\u2019t breaking camp with us,\u201d said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span> \u201cWe tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we\u2019d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.\u201d\nEven before the N.B.A.\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word \u201cprocess\u201d as a euphemism for tanking \u2014 a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston\u2019s attendance sank <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team\u2019s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball\u2019s analytical and technological revolution.\n\u201cTo me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,\u201d said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros\u2019 radio play-by-play voice <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2006 through</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012.</span> \u201cThey brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.\u201d\nThe results began revealing themselves <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros\u2019 database had been hacked by the Cardinals\u2019 scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.\nCorrea eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.\nIn hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa \u2014 who declined an interview request \u2014 could not resist commenting. \u201cGuess who isn\u2019t surprised?\u201d he tweeted.\nBaseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros\u2019 explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before \u2014 as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.\nIn the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington\u2019s wins came at the Astros\u2019 park in Houston.\nSign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology. M.L.B. officers monitor video replay rooms now \u2014 they did not do so <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 and the league will most likely reinforce its rules with prominent signage in clubhouses.\nBut the Astros\u2019 scandal has brought the issue to a crossroads: Should baseball run from technology to crack down on cheating, or lean into it?

We are almost a quarter of the way through the season. Who would have thought that the Celtics would be on track to end up the highest pick of them all by season\u2019s end?\nI\u2019m being hyperbolic. But we\u2019re past the \u201cit\u2019s early\u201d stage to assess the team, and the results are disappointing. Boston lost at home against a terrible Knicks team. Before that, there was a blown double-digit, fourth-quarter lead against a tired Charlotte Hornets team. It\u2019s nothing short of baffling. One of their wins required an unlikely, otherworldly late comeback against an objectively bad Phoenix team. And it\u2019s not like the Celtics are the only team that has had to incorporate players into new roles.\nBrad Stevens\u2019s offense moves the ball well (in the top half of the league in assist percentage) and generates open looks with ease. It\u2019s not a lethargy thing, either: The players seem to like playing with one another and for Stevens. And besides, how do you have one of the league\u2019s best defenses without playing hard?\nBut the open looks just aren\u2019t falling, and neither are the shots around the paint, in the rare instances players actually try to go to the rim. The offense is designed to emphasize the shooting talent of the roster. Everyone has some semblance of a jumper. In today\u2019s N.B.A., this should, in theory, make for a lethal offense. Early on, it was easy to say the bricks were a bug, not a feature. Now you have to wonder if there\u2019s more going on here. Boston shoots <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 35 percent</span> on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, well below the league average.\nWhen the open looks have not fallen, Boston has not found alternatives. The Celtics are near the bottom of the league in drives to the rim per game, which you can get away with if the offense is hitting its jumpers, which it\u2019s not. And when the ball finds its way into the paint, in the restricted area, the Celtics <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shoot 61 percent</span>, also below mediocre.\nAnd then there\u2019s Gordon Hayward, who clearly still needs time. I expected his explosiveness to the rim to need the time, not his 3-point shooting, which is mired <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 28 percent</span>. The lesson: Don\u2019t trust all those off-season workout videos you see of players swishing shots.\nSo those are the worrying signs. The positives? The talent is there. And this is with Kyrie Irving playing some of the best ball of his career. After a slow start, he is shooting <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 percent</span> from the field and is <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 10 in</span> real plus-minus. Jayson Tatum is pulling out of his slump, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shooting 45 percent</span> from the field in November, compared <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 40 percent</span> in October. You have to believe that Jaylen Brown is better than <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 40 percent</span> he is shooting from the field.\nBoston has pulled out some big wins against other Eastern Conference powers: Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. I\u2019m still betting on Boston to go to the N.B.A. finals because Stevens is a master at adjustments and, frankly, in this league, talented players in their prime win. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But if the mediocrity continues, I have to wonder if Danny Ainge will end up regretting not moving more aggressively to trade Brown for Kawhi Leonard.\n</span>And the biggest positive: Look at all those draft picks next year, if things don\u2019t work out!\nCalifornia is once again the wild, wild West\nBy Scott Cacciola\nThe N.B.A.\u2019s California contingent has gone mad. The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are dealing with \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 some dysfunction. The Los Angeles Lakers and their cast of misfit toys are suddenly surging behind the one and only LeBron James. The Los Angeles Clippers, whom few expected to even vie for a playoff spot, are shaping up as one of the more dangerous teams in the Western Conference. And the Sacramento Kings \u2014 well, at least the Kings are still the Kings, reportedly rived by front-office drama.\nOut here in California, where I relocated for the season, up is down, left is right and not a whole lot makes sense, starting with the Warriors, whom I visited toward the end of October. At the time, their season was going well, which was no surprise. I wrote about how they were having lots of fun, months removed from a championship season that apparently had its share of behind-the-scenes agita. But they were enjoying themselves again, and get this: Draymond Green said he had made it a goal to stop complaining to the referees so much.\nMy article did not age well. A kinder, gentler Green proceeded to blow up in Kevin Durant\u2019s face earlier this month, and the fallout has been something to behold. The Warriors have lost a bunch of games. Stephen Curry has been sidelined with an injury. And questions continue to swirl about Durant\u2019s future with the team, with free agency looming this summer.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that no one could have predicted this sort of drama playing out in Oakland. And while I would be shocked to see the Warriors continue to struggle \u2014 awesome talent tends to compensate for a multitude of sins \u2014 the past couple of weeks have illustrated the fragile nature of team chemistry, even when that team is an established superpower.\nSpeaking of superpowers, James is doing it again: elevating an odd collection of inexperienced players and reclamation projects into something that resembles a contender, or at least a competitive team. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Not so long ago, Rajon Rondo was trying to deck Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets, and Magic Johnson, the team president, was yelling at Coach Luke Walton, raising concerns about Walton\u2019s job security.</span> But the Lakers now look pretty cohesive compared with the Warriors, and who saw that coming?\nJames, of course, deserves a lot of the credit. <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Approaching 34 and</span> in his 16th season, he is playing some of the finest basketball of his career.\nThe Clippers, too, have been exciting to watch. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They have ferocious defenders and players who know their roles, and they are going about their business their own way: without a resident superstar, proving there might just be more than one way to win in the modern N.B.A.\nHold off on the hype (i.e., don\u2019t trust the process yet)\n</span>By Kevin Draper\nIt might not work for the Philadelphia 76ers. Jimmy Butler might bolt after the season. He might further erode Markelle Fultz\u2019s confidence. He might not be good enough to be the second-best player on a championship team.\nBut good for the 76ers for finally pushing their chips into the middle of the table and going for it.\nThis isn\u2019t an anti-Process rant, or at least not entirely one. It is a plea for a more realistic understanding of the typical development path and of how few young players actually become stars. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Every team eventually has a young player whom fans overhype, who is sure to be a star and whom the team refuses to trade.\n</span>For Golden State Warriors fans like me, that player was Anthony Randolph, who promised to be a hybrid of Lamar Odom and Kevin Garnett. In six N.B.A. seasons, Randolph started <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 43 games</span> and <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averaged 7.1 points</span>. For Mavericks fans, that player was Rodrigue Beaubois. Declared \u201cuntouchable\u201d by Mark Cuban, he lasted four seasons in the league.\nFultz, Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum \u2014 the top three picks in last year\u2019s draft \u2014 are all struggling. So is Donovan Mitchell, the rookie of the year runner-up. At the same time, De\u2019Aaron Fox and Zach Collins are impressing after pedestrian rookie seasons.\nAll of this is to say that young players are tough to evaluate, and the overwhelming majority of them do not become stars. From <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 draft</span> there is Giannis Antetokounmpo and maybe Victor Oladipo. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2014 there</span> is Joel Embiid. <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2015 there</span> are none yet, unless you\u2019re willing to bet the farm on Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis.\nIf Philadelphia flames out in the playoffs, Butler leaves and Dario Saric turns into a star, the 76ers will look dumb.

Six weeks into the season, this is what that the color change has wrought: In the season opener, Houston Rockets forward P.J. Tucker, the reigning \u201cSneaker Champ\u201d (there is such a thing), wore three different pairs. One was a black and purple Nike <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Kobe 1,</span> which he had signed by Kobe Bryant.\nA kaleidoscope of yellow ocher, Cinnamon Toast Crunch (part of Kyrie Irving\u2019s cereal pack) and green Grinch took center stage. Amid this color burst, there were floral patterns from a Chinese line, a pair inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and a shoe featuring a cartoon version of Rosa Parks on its heel \u2014 as if we needed more proof that the N.B.A. is much more fun than its stodgy pro counterparts.\nArguably the coolest line of kicks belongs to Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who will wear a different sneaker to every game. For the Nets\u2019 game against the 76ers on Sunday, he will debut his Creed shoe, a nod to Rocky\u2019s roots and the release of the movie \u201cCreed II.\u201d\nDinwiddie unveiled a media shoe, a sneaker close to our heart, in the Nets\u2019 home opener against the Knicks. It thanked news organizations for their hard work. (Really!) It featured the logos of ESPN, NBA TV, Bleacher Report, The New York Post and The New York Times among others.\nAgainst Detroit, he wore the shoes honoring Rosa Park. After the Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee died, Dinwiddie called an audible and helped design a tribute shoe. His brand, K8IROS, has honored other sports and entertainment legends, with sneakers inspired by Colin Kaepernick, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Allen Iverson and Jesse Owens, to be auctioned off for charity.\nSignature shoes have long been a benchmark of success in the league, but Dinwiddie thinks what he\u2019s doing \u2014 along with the loosened N.B.A. rules \u2014 may lead to even more fun on the court. \u201cIt would be dope to see everyone try their hand at it and express themselves the way they want to express themselves,\u201d he said.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Making Sense of the N.B.A.\u2019s Wacky Start</h3>It has taken an unusual amount of ink, focus, caffeine and pregame napping to stay on top of all the drama in the N.B.A. this season.\nWithout a running diary, it would be easy to forget that the Oklahoma City Thunder did not win their first game <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 days</span>, or that Blake Griffin <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">scored 50 points</span> against Philadelphia, or that Luke Walton\u2019s run with the Los Angeles Lakers as coach once seemed to be in its final days.\nOnly a fraction of the way through this season, a crew of New York Times sportswriters and friends are ready to reflect.\nHere are their early-season takeaways:\nThe Celtics were supposed to be better than this\nBy Sopan Deb\nThe Boston Celtics could have four first-rounders in next year\u2019s draft, from: the Kings (<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 1 protected</span>), the Grizzlies (1 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8 protected</span>) and the Clippers (1 <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 14 protected</span>), plus their own. We are almost a quarter of the way through the season. Who would have thought that the Celtics would be on track to end up the highest pick of them all by season\u2019s end?\nI\u2019m being hyperbolic. But we\u2019re past the \u201cit\u2019s early\u201d stage to assess the team, and the results are disappointing. Boston lost at home against a terrible Knicks team. Before that, there was a blown double-digit, fourth-quarter lead against a tired Charlotte Hornets team. It\u2019s nothing short of baffling. One of their wins required an unlikely, otherworldly late comeback against an objectively bad Phoenix team. And it\u2019s not like the Celtics are the only team that has had to incorporate players into new roles.\nBrad Stevens\u2019s offense moves the ball well (in the top half of the league in assist percentage) and generates open looks with ease. It\u2019s not a lethargy thing, either: The players seem to like playing with one another and for Stevens. And besides, how do you have one of the league\u2019s best defenses without playing hard?\nBut the open looks just aren\u2019t falling, and neither are the shots around the paint, in the rare instances players actually try to go to the rim. The offense is designed to emphasize the shooting talent of the roster. Everyone has some semblance of a jumper. In today\u2019s N.B.A., this should, in theory, make for a lethal offense. Early on, it was easy to say the bricks were a bug, not a feature. Now you have to wonder if there\u2019s more going on here. Boston shoots <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 35 percent</span> on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, well below the league average.\nWhen the open looks have not fallen, Boston has not found alternatives. The Celtics are near the bottom of the league in drives to the rim per game, which you can get away with if the offense is hitting its jumpers, which it\u2019s not. And when the ball finds its way into the paint, in the restricted area, the Celtics <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shoot 61 percent</span>, also below mediocre.\nAnd then there\u2019s Gordon Hayward, who clearly still needs time. I expected his explosiveness to the rim to need the time, not his 3-point shooting, which is mired <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 28 percent</span>. The lesson: Don\u2019t trust all those off-season workout videos you see of players swishing shots.\nSo those are the worrying signs. The positives? The talent is there. And this is with Kyrie Irving playing some of the best ball of his career. After a slow start, he is shooting <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 percent</span> from the field and is <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 10 in</span> real plus-minus. Jayson Tatum is pulling out of his slump, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shooting 45 percent</span> from the field in November, compared <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 40 percent</span> in October. You have to believe that Jaylen Brown is better than <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 40 percent</span> he is shooting from the field.\nBoston has pulled out some big wins against other Eastern Conference powers: Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. I\u2019m still betting on Boston to go to the N.B.A. finals because Stevens is a master at adjustments and, frankly, in this league, talented players in their prime win. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But if the mediocrity continues, I have to wonder if Danny Ainge will end up regretting not moving more aggressively to trade Brown for Kawhi Leonard.\n</span>And the biggest positive: Look at all those draft picks next year, if things don\u2019t work out!\nCalifornia is once again the wild, wild West\nBy Scott Cacciola\nThe N.B.A.\u2019s California contingent has gone mad. The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are dealing with \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 some dysfunction. The Los Angeles Lakers and their cast of misfit toys are suddenly surging behind the one and only LeBron James. The Los Angeles Clippers, whom few expected to even vie for a playoff spot, are shaping up as one of the more dangerous teams in the Western Conference. And the Sacramento Kings \u2014 well, at least the Kings are still the Kings, reportedly rived by front-office drama.\nOut here in California, where I relocated for the season, up is down, left is right and not a whole lot makes sense, starting with the Warriors, whom I visited toward the end of October. At the time, their season was going well, which was no surprise. I wrote about how they were having lots of fun, months removed from a championship season that apparently had its share of behind-the-scenes agita. But they were enjoying themselves again, and get this: Draymond Green said he had made it a goal to stop complaining to the referees so much.\nMy article did not age well. A kinder, gentler Green proceeded to blow up in Kevin Durant\u2019s face earlier this month, and the fallout has been something to behold. The Warriors have lost a bunch of games. Stephen Curry has been sidelined with an injury. And questions continue to swirl about Durant\u2019s future with the team, with free agency looming this summer.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that no one could have predicted this sort of drama playing out in Oakland. And while I would be shocked to see the Warriors continue to struggle \u2014 awesome talent tends to compensate for a multitude of sins \u2014 the past couple of weeks have illustrated the fragile nature of team chemistry, even when that team is an established superpower.\nSpeaking of superpowers, James is doing it again: elevating an odd collection of inexperienced players and reclamation projects into something that resembles a contender, or at least a competitive team. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Not so long ago, Rajon Rondo was trying to deck Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets, and Magic Johnson, the team president, was yelling at Coach Luke Walton, raising concerns about Walton\u2019s job security.</span> But the Lakers now look pretty cohesive compared with the Warriors, and who saw that coming?\nJames, of course, deserves a lot of the credit. <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Approaching 34 and</span> in his 16th season, he is playing some of the finest basketball of his career.\nThe Clippers, too, have been exciting to watch. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They have ferocious defenders and players who know their roles, and they are going about their business their own way: without a resident superstar, proving there might just be more than one way to win in the modern N.B.A.\nHold off on the hype (i.e., don\u2019t trust the process yet)\n</span>By Kevin Draper\nIt might not work for the Philadelphia 76ers. Jimmy Butler might bolt after the season. He might further erode Markelle Fultz\u2019s confidence. He might not be good enough to be the second-best player on a championship team.\nBut good for the 76ers for finally pushing their chips into the middle of the table and going for it.\nThis isn\u2019t an anti-Process rant, or at least not entirely one. It is a plea for a more realistic understanding of the typical development path and of how few young players actually become stars. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Every team eventually has a young player whom fans overhype, who is sure to be a star and whom the team refuses to trade.\n</span>For Golden State Warriors fans like me, that player was Anthony Randolph, who promised to be a hybrid of Lamar Odom and Kevin Garnett. In six N.B.A. seasons, Randolph started <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 43 games</span> and <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averaged 7.1 points</span>. For Mavericks fans, that player was Rodrigue Beaubois. Declared \u201cuntouchable\u201d by Mark Cuban, he lasted four seasons in the league.\nFultz, Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum \u2014 the top three picks in last year\u2019s draft \u2014 are all struggling. So is Donovan Mitchell, the rookie of the year runner-up. At the same time, De\u2019Aaron Fox and Zach Collins are impressing after pedestrian rookie seasons.\nAll of this is to say that young players are tough to evaluate, and the overwhelming majority of them do not become stars. From <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 draft</span> there is Giannis Antetokounmpo and maybe Victor Oladipo. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2014 there</span> is Joel Embiid. <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2015 there</span> are none yet, unless you\u2019re willing to bet the farm on Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis.\nIf Philadelphia flames out in the playoffs, Butler leaves and Dario Saric turns into a star, the 76ers will look dumb. But the far greater sin is passing on the opportunity to acquire a star in the hope that your young player will develop into one.\nChristmas came early this year\nBy Marc Stein\nThe cynics will tell you there is little reason to follow the N.B.A. regular season.

Jeb Hensarling starts off his statement ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's by marking some territory.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">While he told Mr. Powell, \"We are all rooting for you, because much is at stake,\" he nevertheless said the Fed needs to do a better job communicating its policies.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">He also the Fed \"must stay in its lane\" and not undertake monetary policy strategies that are more appropriately done by Congress.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hensarling also said key aspects of how the Fed manages interest rates now, namely its power to pay banks interest on reserves, are problematic and could compromise the Fed's independence if central bankers stick with this strategy.\n</span>Mr. Powell is walking into the room now for his first congressional testimony. We're still probably a bit away from when things get interesting. First, lots of photos, and then opening statements from the House committeee leaders, and then Mr. Powell will read his testimony. (Ms. Yellen used to eat up time in the hearing with a slow verbatim reading of the already-released written testimony; to be fair, many Congress members show up to the hearings having apparently not yet read it.) Typically, the questioning starts <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> from now.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Some observers of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today see it as a reason to affirm their hawkish views on monetary policy.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">While Fed officials penciled in three rate rises <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2018 in</span> their most recent forecasts, some now reckon a strong economy, juiced by fiscal policy, could drive the Fed to raise rates four times this year.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell hinted \"at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response,\" said analysts at ING.</span> In light of the strong outlook, \"we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter starting with the <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 21 FOMC</span> meeting,\" the firm said. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Capital Economics is also on board for four hikes and called a March move \"a near-certainty.</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"\nThe idea that the Fed will boost its short-term rate target in March is indeed a pretty safe bet.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In a recent television interview, Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader William Dudley said \"as long as I\u2019m comfortable that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace at a time that I think monetary policy is accommodative and financial conditions are easy, I\u2019m probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation\" at the upcoming meeting.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">After that, though, it will come down to Fed officials to signal a shift, which they could of course do in March.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That meeting will include an update of their interest rate and economic forecast.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The case for a more aggressive path is building: Inflation is likely to move up toward <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2% inflation</span> target, in part because of favorable arithmetic relative to last year's unexpectedly weak readings.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The job market remains very strong.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Also, Fed officials are increasing taking on board the positive economic impact of recent tax cuts and government spending increases, even as they worry this stimulus is ill-timed for an economy that's already growing strongly.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed officials normally are reluctant to publicly spot bubbles, but last week, New York Fed President William Dudley pointed the finger at one.\n</span>Mr. Dudley says there appears to be a \"speculative mania around cryptocurrencies in terms of thier valuations, which I view as pretty dangerous, because I don\u2019t really see what the actual true underlying value of some of these cryptocurrencies actually is in practice.\"\nIf asked about cryptocurrencies, it will be interesting to see if Mr. Powell shares Mr. Dudley's

\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\"\n\"While we've used that lyrical reference in the past, we think it does a great job summarizing\" what the chairman is

recent speeches from Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair of supervision: yesterday's speech and last week's speech.</span> Indeed, a lot of similarities.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Markets have largely brushed off the release of Jerome Powell's prewritten testimony, which showed the new Fed chair plans to stick to a gradual path for interest-rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed from before the release, recently <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2.87%,</span> while the dollar

session later this morning will be closely watched by investors for any new clues on how Mr. Powell is thinking about growth, inflation and interest rates.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">One of the big questions about new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today is one of style.</span> The last two central bank leaders, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, were both top-tier academics. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Their style of communication could often skew toward ivory-tower economics, although both of those leaders were models of clarity compared with the deliberately obtuse language of Alan Greenspan.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell isn't an economist, and has a strong background in finance.</span> There's some expectation that Mr. Powell will skew toward shorter and more plain-spoken answers to the questions legislators send his way. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">He's seen as less likely to dive into the technicalities of economic issues.</span> It'll be an interesting test to see whether such a style helps Mr. Powell, should he choose to speak more plainly. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">After all, the Fed does believe its policies are more effective when they are broadly understood.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Setting Fed interest-rate policy based on rules has become a bit of a flash point between Congress and the Fed.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A good number of legislators would like to see the central bank make rate policy based on some sort of rule, something most Fed officials have long pushed back against.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">In his first-ever testimony as Fed leader, Jerome Powell told Congress, \"I find these rule prescriptions helpful.\"</span> But they're not the whole story: \"Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account,\" he said in his prepared remarks.\nFor Mr. Powell, that view represents continuity with the his predecessors.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">One more message from his testimony : Mr. Powell doesn't expect the factors weighing down inflation to repeat themselves.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">He will tell lawmakers that he expects inflation to move up this year and stabilize around the Fed\u2019<span

id=\"40\" class=\"red\">After running below the Fed\u2019s target for years, recent economic data suggests price pressures are finally starting to firm.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell noted monthly inflation readings were \u201ca little higher\u201d at the end <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017 than</span> earlier months, and said he continues to view the inflation shortfall as \u201clikely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">After years of lackluster wage growth, Americans may soon see faster increases in the size of their paychecks, he said.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Wages have continued to grow moderately since the middle <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> \u201cwith a modest acceleration in some measures,\u201d though weak productivity growth in recent years has likely damped some of the pickup in wages, he said.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Given the strong economic outlook, Mr. Powell said \"wages should increase at a faster pace as well.\u201d\nMr. Powell sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy in his prepared testimony Tuesday, noting that \u201csome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">In particular, he noted, fiscal policy has become more stimulative, and foreign demand for U.S. exports \u201cis on a firmer trajectory,\u201d providing \u201cconsiderable\u201d support for the manufacturing sector.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">He said he also expects upbeat sentiment to support continued growth in business investment, and that a strong labor market will bolster household incomes and spending growth.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u201cIndeed, the economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell's testimony is pretty sanguine about the market's recent wobbles, saying: \u201cat this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\"\nFed officials have worried in the past that high and rising equity prices could inflate a new stock-market bubble.</span> <span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">The return of market volatility could actually ease those concerns somewhat, as could rising yields on government debt, as they make the market look less \"bubbly.</span>\"\nMr. Powell's prewritten testimony has been released! <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Here's the key takeaway from our colleague David Harrison:\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress Tuesday the central bank remains on track to gradually raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel amid strengthening growth and inflation.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cFurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.\u201d\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">A new flashpoint in the debate over the Federal Reserve's postcrisis monetary policies was opened up just last week, when a group of leading economists published a paper at a premier economics conference, arguing that the Fed's quantitative easing policies were largely ineffective.\n</span><span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The original concern that many had with the Fed's large-scale bond-buying , known as QE for short, was that it would spur runaway inflation and weaken the U.S. dollar.</span> Nothing of the sort happened; rather, it's hard to prove that QE did much of anything at all.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Although the Fed is clearly in tightening mode right now, it will be interesting to hear if Mr. Powell shares any of this skepticism about one of the Fed's major policies over the past decade.</span> <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Any commentary from Mr. Powell could provide hints about how the Fed would react during the next downturn.\n</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Read more here:\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s signature bond buying stimulus program undertaken during and in the wake of the financial

to hear from the Federal Reserve about its unprecedented decision, on Janet Yellen's final day in office, to drop the hammer on Wells Fargo & Co.\nBefore leaving the building, Ms. Yellen signed off on extensive penalties for the \"widespread consumer abuses\" at Wells Fargo that were announced in the evening of her final Friday.</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The Fed announced that Wells Fargo would be replacing four members of its board of directors and took action to limit the ability of Wells Fargo to grow.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">On the first day of trading after the announcement, Wells Fargo <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 7.8%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">And just like that, Ms. Yellen was done at the

Jeb Hensarling Puts Down a Marker Ahead of Jerome Powell's Testimony\nSome See in Powell Testimony a Reason to be Hawkish on Rates\nThe Fed's Concern on Cryptocurrencies\nA Closer Look at Wage Growth\nMarkets Shrug Off Jerome Powell's Testimony\nCongressman Jeb Hensarling opened the hearing by asking Mr. Powell about whether the Fed is going to stick with using its current interest-rate setting tool, the ability to pay banks interest on their excess reserves.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">This has only been the Fed's principal policy tool in the last couple of years.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The Fed used to control rates through open market operations.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said that for now the Fed is sticking with interest on excess reserves: \"We have not made a decision in the longer-run whether that will continue to be our framework or if we\u2019ll return to something more like before the crisis,\" he said.</span> \"This is not a near-term decision\" and \"our current approach seems to be working well.<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"\nRep. Jeb Hensarling starts off his statement ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's by marking some territory.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">While he told Mr. Powell, \"We are all rooting for you, because much is at stake,\" he nevertheless said the Fed needs to do a better job communicating its policies.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">He also the Fed \"must stay in its lane\" and not undertake monetary policy strategies that are more appropriately done by Congress.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hensarling also said key aspects of how the Fed manages interest rates now, namely its power to pay banks interest on reserves, are problematic and could compromise the Fed's independence if central bankers stick with this strategy.\n</span>Mr. Powell is walking into the room now for his first congressional testimony. We're still probably a bit away from when things get interesting. First, lots of photos, and then opening statements from the House committeee leaders, and then Mr. Powell will read his testimony. (Ms. Yellen used to eat up time in the hearing with a slow verbatim reading of the already-released written testimony; to be fair, many Congress members show up to the hearings having apparently not yet read it.) Typically, the questioning starts <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> from now.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Some observers of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today see it as a reason to affirm their hawkish views on monetary policy.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">While Fed officials penciled in three rate rises <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2018 in</span> their most recent forecasts, some now reckon a strong economy, juiced by fiscal policy, could drive the Fed to raise rates four times this year.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell hinted \"at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response,\" said analysts at ING.</span> In light of the strong outlook, \"we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter starting with the <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 21 FOMC</span> meeting,\" the firm said. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Capital Economics is also on board for four hikes and called a March move \"a near-certainty.</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"\nThe idea that the Fed will boost its short-term rate target in March is indeed a pretty safe bet.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In a recent television interview, Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader William Dudley said \"as long as I\u2019m comfortable that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace at a time that I think monetary policy is accommodative and financial conditions are easy, I\u2019m probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation\" at the upcoming meeting.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">After that, though, it will come down to Fed officials to signal a shift, which they could of course do in March.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That meeting will include an update of their interest rate and economic forecast.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The case for a more aggressive path is building: Inflation is likely to move up toward <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2% inflation</span> target, in part because of favorable arithmetic relative to last year's unexpectedly weak readings.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The job market remains very strong.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Also, Fed officials are increasing taking on board the positive economic impact of recent tax cuts and government spending increases, even as they worry this stimulus is ill-timed for an economy that's already growing strongly.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed officials normally are reluctant to publicly spot bubbles, but last week, New York Fed President William Dudley pointed the finger at one.\n</span>Mr. Dudley says there appears to be a \"speculative mania around cryptocurrencies in terms of thier valuations, which I view as pretty dangerous, because I don\u2019t really see what the actual true underlying value of some of these cryptocurrencies actually is in practice.\"\nIf asked about cryptocurrencies, it will be interesting to see if Mr. Powell shares Mr. Dudley's assessment.\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley warned there\u2019s considerable danger and risk right now around the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies that seek to supplant the U.S. dollar.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Read Full Article\nMr. Powell's comments on wage growth could be a key focus of his testimony today.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">While we wait for the hearing to start, here's a closer look at what's been happening with wage growth recently:\nThere are reasons for caution: It hit just pockets of the labor market and previous breakouts have been short-lived.\n</span>Read Full Article\nThe writers of Wall Street research notes always love a good classic-rock lyric as a short and sweet way to sum up an issue. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">And so it goes for Jerome Powell's first-ever testimony as Fed chairman.\n</span>BMO Capital Markets strategist Ian Lyngen goes straight for The Who in summing up Mr. Powell's testimony: \"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\"\n\"While we've used that lyrical reference in the past, we think it does a great job summarizing\" what the chairman is slated to say today and the continuity of his views relative to former Fed leader Janet Yellen, Mr. Lyngen wrote.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">For comparison, here's our coverage of the two recent speeches from Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair of supervision: yesterday's speech and last week's speech.</span> Indeed, a lot of similarities.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Markets have largely brushed off the release of Jerome Powell's prewritten testimony, which showed the new Fed chair plans to stick to a gradual path for interest-rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed from before the release, recently <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2.87%,</span> while the dollar edged <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.1%.</span></span> S&P futures <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">slipped 0.2%.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">BMO Capital Markets analysts say the muted market reaction suggests Mr. Powell's testimony is a \"fully priced-in event.</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">\"\nStill, his Q&A session later this morning will be closely watched by investors for any new clues on how Mr. Powell is thinking about growth, inflation and interest rates.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">One of the big questions about new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today is one of style.</span> The last two central bank leaders, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, were both top-tier academics. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Their style of communication could often skew toward ivory-tower economics, although both of those leaders were models of clarity compared with the deliberately obtuse language of Alan Greenspan.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell isn't an economist, and has a strong background in finance.</span> There's some expectation that Mr. Powell will skew toward shorter and more plain-spoken answers to the questions legislators send his way. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">He's seen as less likely to dive into the technicalities of economic issues.</span> It'll be an interesting test to see whether such a style helps Mr. Powell, should he choose to speak more plainly. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">After all, the Fed does believe its policies are more effective when they are broadly understood.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Setting Fed interest-rate policy based on rules has become a bit of a flash point between Congress and the Fed.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A good number of legislators would like to see the central bank make rate policy based on some sort of rule, something most Fed officials have long pushed back against.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">In his first-ever testimony as Fed leader, Jerome Powell told Congress, \"I find these rule prescriptions helpful.\"</span> But they're not the whole story: \"Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account,\" he said in his prepared remarks.\nFor Mr. Powell, that view represents continuity with the his predecessors.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">One more message from his testimony : Mr. Powell doesn't expect the factors

He had previously said that most of the industrial city had been taken over by the Russians.\nSIVERSK DISTRICT, Ukraine \u2014 One of the few civilians still driving on a road leading toward the battle front, Oleksandr Chaplik skidded to a stop and leaned out the car window to swap information with a villager.\nHe was taking supplies back to his village, one of a handful still in Ukrainian hands that lie in the path of the Russian advance.\n\u201cWe are surrounded on all sides,\u201d said Mr. Chaplik,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 55,</span> a dairy and livestock farmer. \u201cIt is the second month without light, without water, without gas, without communication, without the internet, without news. Basically, horror.\u201d\n\u201cBut people need to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a businessman. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">So I am doing my job.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik owns <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 75 acres</span> of land near the city of Sievierodonetsk, where Russian and Ukrainian troops have been battling for control in heavy street fighting in recent days.</span> The countryside around his farm is under almost constant bombardment by Russian forces trying to encircle the easternmost Ukrainian forces and lay siege to Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.\nThe roar of multiple rocket launcher systems being fired south of the farm rattled the windows and doors of his home. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, those are Ukrainian,\u201d he said as he gave a tour of his farm. \u201cHere, thank God, the guys are holding firm.\u201d\nBELARUS\nRUSSIA\nKyiv\nLviv\nUKRAINE\nSievierodonetsk\nLysychansk\nDnipro\nMOLDOVA\nROMANIA\nSea of\nAzov\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">CRIMEA\n100 mileS</span>\nBut the war has come dangerously close. Craters from bombs and artillery shells scar his fields. Leaning against the wall of one of his barns stood the casings of a dozen rockets that Mr. Chaplik had collected from around the farm. The rockets delivered cluster bombs, he said, which still littered his hayfields.\n\u201cThey want to be eating grass,\u201d he said as he walked down the stalls of <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 35 dairy</span> cows. \u201cBut I cannot let the cows loose on this grass because of these bombs, and I am scared they will fall in the bomb craters.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik is a fraying connection to the world for his increasingly isolated village, which he asked not be named so it would not suffer retribution from Russian troops. At considerable risk to himself, he provides vital supplies and information, and keeps producing food as best he can.\nMany other farmers have left the area but he said he could not. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I leave, I will not be able to return to the village, I will not be able to look people in the eye.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But as the war has crept closer, he has had to shrink his business while trying to keep the farm producing and workers fed and paid.</span> With utilities cut off, he runs the milk machines on generators, but can only operate his refrigerators <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 hours</span> a day.\n\u201cWe used to make <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 100 different</span> milk products,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a two-years-old Parmesan cheese. I made unique products that no one else was making, sour cream, cream, mozzarella, burrata.\u201d\nBut without electricity he has had to cut down on production. There was a shortage of containers, he added. He removed two cheeses with moldy rinds from a fridge. \u201cThey are no good,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has moved his food production operations to several different parts of the country, placing part of his dairy production in the nearby market town of Bakhmut, where he already has an organic meat and dairy shop, and relocating his meat production plants to the relatively safe cities of Dnipro and Lviv.\n</span>His family has moved, too. His wife is a teacher and two of his children are university students, so they needed to go somewhere with the internet to be able to keep working, he said. They were calling him daily, pleading with him to join them, but he said he still had work to do.\nHis work force has contracted, as many villagers left with their families for safer parts of the country. \u201cI have fields and machines and diesel but I do not have the workers,\u201d he said. But he pulled together <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 workers</span> who remained, so they now live and eat together.\nTwo teenage girls were mucking out the cow stalls. \u201cThey are the daughters of my workers. They are children, but I have no workers,\u201d he said.\nA pensioner, Lyudmila,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> has stepped in to run his shop in the village.\n\u201cDid you get cucumbers?\u201d she called out, as Mr. Chaplik unloaded bottled water and fresh vegetables from his van.\n\u201cWithout him we would be lost,\u201d she said. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Villagers could not travel to the market, and prices there were much higher anyway, she said.\n</span>But the strain shows on Mr. Chaplik\u2019s face. He looks like he has not slept in days. He complained of toothache and a twitch around his eye. One of the hardest things, he said, was fielding the panicked telephone calls from relatives trying to reach the villagers who have remained behind. The cellphone service in the village has been knocked out <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">but they know that Mr. Chaplik drives into town every day to the market, where cell service continues, and they bombard him with calls.\n</span>\u201cMy nerves are cracking,\u201d he said, as he declined another phone call. \u201cI am <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">working 14 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15 hours</span> a day. Physically I am tired.\u201d\nSo now he is arranging for his son to bring in a mobile antenna, so the villagers can be in touch with their relatives.\nHe sees more problems on the horizon. The war has disrupted farming and food production to such an extent that people in eastern Ukraine could go hungry in coming months, he warned.\nThe potatoes are already planted, which will provide food for the villagers, he said, but meat and milk will become scarce.\n\u201cIf I do not prepare feed for my cows they will die this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot cut the hay because of the cluster bombs in the fields and I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">need 12,000 bales</span> of hay and I do not have the workers.\u201d\nAnd as he follows the progress of the war, and the steady advance of Russian troops, he said it was likely that they would seize control of the village and he would lose the farm that he built up over more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 years</span>.\nSeparatist forces backed by Russia seized the area <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 but</span> were pushed back after a few months. But this time he said he did not expect President Vladimir V. Putin to stop.

Russia\u2019s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said.\nIn his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also used the 100th day of war as a way of focusing on how numbers have come to define the war: the number of those killed or wounded, or the number of attacks launched against the country. Particularly haunting is the number of children who have been killed in the war, which Mr. Zelensky said <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 261 as</span> of Friday morning, a number that could not be independently identified. \u201cFor what?\" Mr. Zelensky asked. \u201cThere are no words that can answer this question.\u201d\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said in a Twitter message that he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland while the two officials were in Washington on Friday and discussed Finland\u2019s application to NATO.

The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world,\u201d said Mr. Guterres in a statement on Friday. He said the U.N. stands ready to help in those efforts.\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out several American cities for having sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.\nMr. Zelensky, who spoke to the gathering of mayors just after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago; Jacksonville, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; San Diego and San Jose, Calif., for maintaining sister-city ties in Russia. He said those relationships should be severed.\n\u201cWhat do those ties give to you? Probably nothing,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cBut they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.\u201d\nChicago announced earlier this year that it was suspending, but not permanently ending, its sister-city relationship with Moscow, which had been in place <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1997.</span> Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister-city relationship with Ekaterinburg, Russia. As of Friday, websites for the sister-city programs in Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.\nMany American municipalities have sister-city relationships in several countries. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Though the partnerships can include business and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local nonprofit organizations.\n</span>But Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the mayors<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia even the smallest bit of added credibility.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cDon\u2019t make any excuses; don\u2019t maintain relations with Russia,\u201d said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech received applause from the mayors and city employees who had gathered in Reno, Nev. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t let those who became murderers call your cities their sister cities.\u201d\n</span>Officials in Portland referred to a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners. Officials in the other American cities that Mr. Zelensky named did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe nightly address from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday was an impassioned one, reflecting on how<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> of war has dramatically altered the country\u2019s vocabulary, redefining or introducing new words, terms and phrases into Ukrainians\u2019 everyday language. \"One hundred days -- one hundred words,\" he said, as he listed the words as a way to look back at more than three months of war. Justice, heroes, reconstruction, security and liberation are among the words guiding the country forward and giving it hope, Mr. Zelensky said, including what he referred to as the three most important words underpinning their fight: \u201cpeace, victory, Ukraine.\u201d\nMr. Zelensky added that he hopes many words that have become common in Ukraine will one day be relegated to the past. Words such as filtration, deportation and torture. But he also used the milestone to offer inspiration. \u201cWhen we hear the word \u2018Patron,\u2019 we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to the bomb-sniffing dog he awarded with state honors last month.\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A meeting on Friday between the head of the African Union and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia highlighted the acute needs each one hopes the other can fill: Africa needs food, and the Kremlin needs allies.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine, ordinarily a major exporter of grain, has worsened food crises in Africa and the Middle East, and the African Union chief, President Macky Sall of Senegal, said the grain should be freed up.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur countries, although they are far from the theater, are victims of this crisis on an economic level,\u201d Mr. Sall said at a joint news conference with Mr. Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n</span>At the same time, Mr. Sall told Mr. Putin, whom he called his \u201cdear friend Vladimir,\u201d that Western sanctions on Russia had compounded Africa\u2019s lack of access to grain \u2014 an argument Moscow has been making. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Sall explicitly called for the lifting of restrictions on exports of Russian wheat and fertilizer.\n</span>Mr. Sall\u2019s comments were something of a diplomatic victory for Mr. Putin. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">European leaders have accused the Russian president of creating a global food crisis by blocking wheat exports and seizing Ukrainian grain, all the while trying to blame shortages on sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.\n</span>Global food stocks were already low before the invasion, and the war has made the shortfall worse. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">African countries import more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 40 percent</span> of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The United Nations says food prices worldwide <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 23 percent</span> higher than a year ago, reflecting the tight supply.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The United States and its allies have condemned the invasion of Ukraine and have cut most economic ties to Russia, leaving Moscow with fewer diplomatic and trading partners.\n</span>But Russia has longstanding ties to many African countries, some dating to its Soviet-era support for liberation struggles against colonial rulers. Mr. Putin has cultivated those relations and has so far mitigated criticism from most African countries.\nMr. Putin gathered African leaders in Sochi <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 and</span> has positioned the continent as key to Russia\u2019s interests, while France and the United States have withdrawn from involvement in some conflicts there.\nWith little investment, Russia has made itself a central player on the continent, becoming Africa\u2019s largest supplier of arms, propping up authoritarian leaders and portraying itself as being on the side of African countries in their fight for more independence from the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia.\n\u201cThose friends and allies Russia needs, it can find them on the African continent, so it wants to keep such relations tight,\u201d said Pauline Bax, an expert on Africa with the International Crisis Group.\nStill, such efforts have paid off. Russia has managed to mute criticism of its invasion of Ukraine among leaders in Africa but also in Asia and Latin America.\nIn April, the United Nations General Assembly <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">voted 93 to</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 to</span> exclude Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. But most African nations either voted against the measure, abstained or simply did not cast a vote, including countries usually aligned with the views of Western countries, like Senegal, a regional peace broker.\nGilles Yabi, the director of the Wathi research group in Dakar, said the vote created some surprise outside Africa, revealing a perception in the United States and Europe that African countries would not act independently in the crisis.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe ramifications of the conflict for Africa are economic,\u201d Mr. Yabi said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that African countries look at the war according to their interests.\u201d\nAppearing with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Sall claimed, erroneously, that \u201cdespite enormous pressure, the majority of African countries have avoided to condemn Russia in this situation.\u201d At <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 of</span> Africa\u2019<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 54 countries</span> have condemned the invasion in some fashion, though generally without the vehemence seen in Washington or European capitals.\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied Russia\u2019s relations with Africa, said the United States and Europe liked to think that Russia has been isolated since it invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cMacky Sall\u2019s visit on behalf of the African Union, the votes at the U.N., show that Russia might be isolated from America, Europe, Taiwan and Japan, but necessarily not from the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe African Union has vowed to remain in a neutral position in the conflict, and Mr. Sall has tried to cast himself as a potential mediator. Yet in practice, some analysts say, the African Union has showed deference to Russia.\nThat was evident when, after his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Sall was scheduled to fly back to Africa on Friday without meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIn addition, Mr. Zelensky has asked for months to address the African Union, and even though Mr. Sall said this week that the Ukrainian leader could soon address the organization in a videoconference, no date has been announced.\nJoseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an arm of the Pentagon\u2019s National Defense University, noted that Mr. Putin has tried to portray his invasion of Ukraine as an ideological battle against the West. That message has resonated across Africa, he said.\nMr. Putin has even used the looming grain shortage to cast the United States and its allies in bad light, he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe is twisting the narrative to suggest that the sanctions are causing the pain and price inflation for food across the globe, rather than acknowledging that the entire food crisis related to the conflict is his making,\u201d Mr. Siegle said.\n</span>Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine\nElectrical workers installing a new electricity pole near the village of Kukhari, <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 58 miles</span> northwest of Kyiv.

Grad missiles streaked through the sky from Ukrainian-held territory toward Russian positions.\nRussian forces have been edging ever closer to seizing Sievierodonetsk and taking total control of the Luhansk region, part of the broader area known as Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. Capturing the industrial Donbas region could give Mr. Putin a victory to herald to the Russian people.\nBut Ukraine on Friday was battling to hang on in Sievierodonetsk, underscoring the government\u2019s determination to resist Russia\u2019s onslaught until the arrival of heavier weapons from the West that could potentially help turn the war in its favor.\nThe head of the Ukrainian military administration in the region, Serhiy Haidai, said Friday that at least one person had been killed in Sievierodonetsk and that the battle was ongoing in the heart of the city. He said that Russian forces maintained their grip on a highway that had acted as a conduit both for people seeking to flee the city as well as for incoming supplies.\nThat highway runs southwest from Sievierodonetsk across the Seversky Donets River, through the adjoining city of Lysychansk and on to the city of Bakmut in Donetsk province.\nRussian artillery has targeted the road, as well as several towns and villages along the route, part of Moscow\u2019s bid to tighten its grip on Luhansk, a province where it already holds almost all of the land. Russia has massed its forces in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in the Donbas region after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, early in the conflict.\nA British intelligence report said on Friday that Russian forces were \u201cachieving tactical success\u201d in Luhansk and had momentum, noting that they should be able to take full control of the province in the next two weeks. Mr. Haidai has disputed that analysis.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The United States, Britain and Germany all said this week they would supply Ukraine with missile systems that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky had sought to offset Russia\u2019s advantage in long-range artillery.</span> But it is not clear when those weapons will arrive or how a possible new Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks will take shape.\nUntil then, Ukrainian attempts to slow Moscow\u2019s progress in the Donbas could deplete Russia of both personnel and arms.\n\u201cRussian forces continued to make incremental, grinding, and costly progress in eastern Ukraine,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Local residents and Ukrainian officials in the area of Sievierodonetsk said Friday that Ukrainian forces were still holding their own \u2014 even pushing back some Russian forces.\nOne Ukrainian reporter for Radio Liberty traveled in with the Ukrainian army across the last standing bridge into the city. Two Reuters journalists were wounded and their driver was killed after their vehicle, which had been provided by Russia-backed forces, came under fire while heading to Sievierodonetsk on a Russian-held part of road, according to the news agency.\nReporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine\nAmidst stretchers, camouflage netting and bloodstained medical gear, Ukrainian soldiers were examined by medical personnel at a makeshift aid station in Bakhmut, only a few miles west of the Donetsk and Luhansk regional border, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Seeking to leverage a global food crisis to get relief from international sanctions, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said on Friday that Ukrainian grain could travel by rail through his country to ports on the Baltic Sea, but only if Belarus is allowed to use the same ports to export its own goods.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Moscow, made the offer in a telephone conversation with the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, according to Belta, the Belarusian state news agency.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Russia has blockaded Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea, which were previously the main export route for Ukrainian grain and oilseeds.</span> The war has left <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 25 million</span> tons of grain stranded in silos and at risk of rotting away unless it is moved soon.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">U.N. officials have warned the blockade will cause rising prices and severe food shortages, particularly in Africa, where famines are possible.</span> Moscow has said it would consider letting grain shipments through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. Ukraine\u2019s allies have been seeking alternative overland routes.\nBelarus controls the railway lines that offer the most direct, cheapest and fastest route for large volumes of grain to be shipped out of Ukraine to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and other Baltic ports.\nBut getting access to those rail lines has been complicated because Belarus is allied with Russia in the current conflict. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Belarus was a staging ground for Russia\u2019s Feb.<span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 invasion</span> of Ukraine, and Mr. Lukashenko has expressed fury at Western sanctions on what had been his country\u2019s biggest export earner, potash fertilizer.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Belarus, which is landlocked, exported nearly all its potash through the port at Klaipeda until Feb.<span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> when Lithuania halted the traffic, severing a vital economic artery for Mr. Lukashenko.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s offer to Mr. Guterres seems to be a gambit to restore that lifeline.

Craters from bombs and artillery shells scar his fields. Leaning against the wall of one of his barns stood the casings of a dozen rockets that Mr. Chaplik had collected from around the farm. The rockets delivered cluster bombs, he said, which still littered his hayfields.\n\u201cThey want to be eating grass,\u201d he said as he walked down the stalls of <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 35 dairy</span> cows. \u201cBut I cannot let the cows loose on this grass because of these bombs, and I am scared they will fall in the bomb craters.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik is a fraying connection to the world for his increasingly isolated village, which he asked not be named so it would not suffer retribution from Russian troops. At considerable risk to himself, he provides vital supplies and information, and keeps producing food as best he can.\nMany other farmers have left the area but he said he could not. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I leave, I will not be able to return to the village, I will not be able to look people in the eye.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But as the war has crept closer, he has had to shrink his business while trying to keep the farm producing and workers fed and paid.</span> With utilities cut off, he runs the milk machines on generators, but can only operate his refrigerators <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 hours</span> a day.\n\u201cWe used to make <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 100 different</span> milk products,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a two-years-old Parmesan cheese. I made unique products that no one else was making, sour cream, cream, mozzarella, burrata.\u201d\nBut without electricity he has had to cut down on production. There was a shortage of containers, he added. He removed two cheeses with moldy rinds from a fridge. \u201cThey are no good,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has moved his food production operations to several different parts of the country, placing part of his dairy production in the nearby market town of Bakhmut, where he already has an organic meat and dairy shop, and relocating his meat production plants to the relatively safe cities of Dnipro and Lviv.\n</span>His family has moved, too. His wife is a teacher and two of his children are university students, so they needed to go somewhere with the internet to be able to keep working, he said. They were calling him daily, pleading with him to join them, but he said he still had work to do.\nHis work force has contracted, as many villagers left with their families for safer parts of the country. \u201cI have fields and machines and diesel but I do not have the workers,\u201d he said.

They are children, but I have no workers,\u201d he said.\nA pensioner, Lyudmila,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> has stepped in to run his shop in the village.\n\u201cDid you get cucumbers?\u201d she called out, as Mr. Chaplik unloaded bottled water and fresh vegetables from his van.\n\u201cWithout him we would be lost,\u201d she said. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Villagers could not travel to the market, and prices there were much higher anyway, she said.\n</span>But the strain shows on Mr. Chaplik\u2019s face. He looks like he has not slept in days. He complained of toothache and a twitch around his eye. One of the hardest things, he said, was fielding the panicked telephone calls from relatives trying to reach the villagers who have remained behind. The cellphone service in the village has been knocked out <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">but they know that Mr. Chaplik drives into town every day to the market, where cell service continues, and they bombard him with calls.\n</span>\u201cMy nerves are cracking,\u201d he said, as he declined another phone call. \u201cI am <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">working 14 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15 hours</span> a day. Physically I am tired.\u201d\nSo now he is arranging for his son to bring in a mobile antenna, so the villagers can be in touch with their relatives.\nHe sees more problems on the horizon. The war has disrupted farming and food production to such an extent that people in eastern Ukraine could go hungry in coming months, he warned.\nThe potatoes are already planted, which will provide food for the villagers, he said, but meat and milk will become scarce.\n\u201cIf I do not prepare feed for my cows they will die this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot cut the hay because of the cluster bombs in the fields and I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">need 12,000 bales</span> of hay and I do not have the workers.\u201d\nAnd as he follows the progress of the war, and the steady advance of Russian troops, he said it was likely that they would seize control of the village and he would lose the farm that he built up over more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 years</span>.\nSeparatist forces backed by Russia seized the area <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 but</span> were pushed back after a few months. But this time he said he did not expect President Vladimir V. Putin to stop. The Russian leader wants to seize a swathe of the country from the city of Kharkiv in the northeast to Odessa in the southwest, he said.\n\u201cHe will not calm down,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will fight for a year, two, three, until he reaches his goal.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik has been slaughtering his pigs, so only one remains, slumbering in his pen. The newborn calves will have to be slaughtered too, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nIf the Russians came, he added, he would have to leave his guard dogs, six German shepherds. \u201cI could not bear to put them down,\u201d he said. \u201cI will let them loose.\u201d\nIf the shells came too close, he would take his workers and leave, he said. \u201cI will start anew,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me a little piece of land, in Ukraine, in the United States, wherever. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">I can build a great business again.\u201d\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nAn air-launched cruise missile hit the Odesa region on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast early Saturday morning, Odesa city officials said on Telegram. The missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses, injuring two people, according to the officials.\nReporting from Seoul\nRussia\u2019s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine\u2019s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war, the British Defense Ministry said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Russian reliance on deep strikes has probably depleted the country\u2019s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nUkrainian troops engaging in a block-by-block fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in Luhansk Province, have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 20 percent</span></span>, the regional military administrator, Serhiy Haidai, said in a television interview.

Russia\u2019s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said.\nIn his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also used the 100th day of war as a way of focusing on how numbers have come to define the war: the number of those killed or wounded, or the number of attacks launched against the country. Particularly haunting is the number of children who have been killed in the war, which Mr. Zelensky said <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 261 as</span> of Friday morning, a number that could not be independently identified. \u201cFor what?\" Mr. Zelensky asked. \u201cThere are no words that can answer this question.\u201d\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said in a Twitter message that he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland while the two officials were in Washington on Friday and discussed Finland\u2019s application to NATO.

The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world,\u201d said Mr. Guterres in a statement on Friday. He said the U.N. stands ready to help in those efforts.\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out several American cities for having sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.\nMr. Zelensky, who spoke to the gathering of mayors just after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago; Jacksonville, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; San Diego and San Jose, Calif., for maintaining sister-city ties in Russia. He said those relationships should be severed.\n\u201cWhat do those ties give to you? Probably nothing,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cBut they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.\u201d\nChicago announced earlier this year that it was suspending, but not permanently ending, its sister-city relationship with Moscow, which had been in place <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1997.</span> Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister-city relationship with Ekaterinburg, Russia. As of Friday, websites for the sister-city programs in Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.\nMany American municipalities have sister-city relationships in several countries. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Though the partnerships can include business and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local nonprofit organizations.\n</span>But Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the mayors<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia even the smallest bit of added credibility.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cDon\u2019t make any excuses; don\u2019t maintain relations with Russia,\u201d said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech received applause from the mayors and city employees who had gathered in Reno, Nev. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t let those who became murderers call your cities their sister cities.\u201d\n</span>Officials in Portland referred to a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners. Officials in the other American cities that Mr. Zelensky named did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe nightly address from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday was an impassioned one, reflecting on how<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> of war has dramatically altered the country\u2019s vocabulary, redefining or introducing new words, terms and phrases into Ukrainians\u2019 everyday language. \"One hundred days -- one hundred words,\" he said, as he listed the words as a way to look back at more than three months of war. Justice, heroes, reconstruction, security and liberation are among the words guiding the country forward and giving it hope, Mr. Zelensky said, including what he referred to as the three most important words underpinning their fight: \u201cpeace, victory, Ukraine.\u201d\nMr. Zelensky added that he hopes many words that have become common in Ukraine will one day be relegated to the past. Words such as filtration, deportation and torture. But he also used the milestone to offer inspiration. \u201cWhen we hear the word \u2018Patron,\u2019 we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to the bomb-sniffing dog he awarded with state honors last month.\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A meeting on Friday between the head of the African Union and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia highlighted the acute needs each one hopes the other can fill: Africa needs food, and the Kremlin needs allies.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine, ordinarily a major exporter of grain, has worsened food crises in Africa and the Middle East, and the African Union chief, President Macky Sall of Senegal, said the grain should be freed up.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur countries, although they are far from the theater, are victims of this crisis on an economic level,\u201d Mr. Sall said at a joint news conference with Mr. Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n</span>At the same time, Mr. Sall told Mr. Putin, whom he called his \u201cdear friend Vladimir,\u201d that Western sanctions on Russia had compounded Africa\u2019s lack of access to grain \u2014 an argument Moscow has been making. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Sall explicitly called for the lifting of restrictions on exports of Russian wheat and fertilizer.\n</span>Mr. Sall\u2019s comments were something of a diplomatic victory for Mr. Putin. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">European leaders have accused the Russian president of creating a global food crisis by blocking wheat exports and seizing Ukrainian grain, all the while trying to blame shortages on sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.\n</span>Global food stocks were already low before the invasion, and the war has made the shortfall worse. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">African countries import more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 40 percent</span> of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The United Nations says food prices worldwide <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 23 percent</span> higher than a year ago, reflecting the tight supply.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The United States and its allies have condemned the invasion of Ukraine and have cut most economic ties to Russia, leaving Moscow with fewer diplomatic and trading partners.\n</span>But Russia has longstanding ties to many African countries, some dating to its Soviet-era support for liberation struggles against colonial rulers. Mr. Putin has cultivated those relations and has so far mitigated criticism from most African countries.\nMr. Putin gathered African leaders in Sochi <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 and</span> has positioned the continent as key to Russia\u2019s interests, while France and the United States have withdrawn from involvement in some conflicts there.\nWith little investment, Russia has made itself a central player on the continent, becoming Africa\u2019s largest supplier of arms, propping up authoritarian leaders and portraying itself as being on the side of African countries in their fight for more independence from the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia.\n\u201cThose friends and allies Russia needs, it can find them on the African continent, so it wants to keep such relations tight,\u201d said Pauline Bax, an expert on Africa with the International Crisis Group.\nStill, such efforts have paid off. Russia has managed to mute criticism of its invasion of Ukraine among leaders in Africa but also in Asia and Latin America.\nIn April, the United Nations General Assembly <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">voted 93 to</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 to</span> exclude Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. But most African nations either voted against the measure, abstained or simply did not cast a vote, including countries usually aligned with the views of Western countries, like Senegal, a regional peace broker.\nGilles Yabi, the director of the Wathi research group in Dakar, said the vote created some surprise outside Africa, revealing a perception in the United States and Europe that African countries would not act independently in the crisis.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe ramifications of the conflict for Africa are economic,\u201d Mr. Yabi said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that African countries look at the war according to their interests.\u201d\nAppearing with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Sall claimed, erroneously, that \u201cdespite enormous pressure, the majority of African countries have avoided to condemn Russia in this situation.\u201d At <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 of</span> Africa\u2019<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 54 countries</span> have condemned the invasion in some fashion, though generally without the vehemence seen in Washington or European capitals.\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied Russia\u2019s relations with Africa, said the United States and Europe liked to think that Russia has been isolated since it invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cMacky Sall\u2019s visit on behalf of the African Union, the votes at the U.N., show that Russia might be isolated from America, Europe, Taiwan and Japan, but necessarily not from the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe African Union has vowed to remain in a neutral position in the conflict, and Mr. Sall has tried to cast himself as a potential mediator. Yet in practice, some analysts say, the African Union has showed deference to Russia.\nThat was evident when, after his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Sall was scheduled to fly back to Africa on Friday without meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIn addition, Mr. Zelensky has asked for months to address the African Union, and even though Mr. Sall said this week that the Ukrainian leader could soon address the organization in a videoconference, no date has been announced.\nJoseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an arm of the Pentagon\u2019s National Defense University, noted that Mr. Putin has tried to portray his invasion of Ukraine as an ideological battle against the West. That message has resonated across Africa, he said.\nMr. Putin has even used the looming grain shortage to cast the United States and its allies in bad light, he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe is twisting the narrative to suggest that the sanctions are causing the pain and price inflation for food across the globe, rather than acknowledging that the entire food crisis related to the conflict is his making,\u201d Mr. Siegle said.\n</span>Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine\nElectrical workers installing a new electricity pole near the village of Kukhari, <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 58 miles</span> northwest of Kyiv.

Without support from the government or organizations, a resident clears debris at his mother\u2019s house, which was destroyed by Russian strikes.\nThe skies around Sievierodonetsk are heavy with smoke as Ukraine battles Russia for the eastern city.\nSIVERSK, Ukraine \u2014 The skies around Sievierodonetsk were heavy with smoke on Friday, with artillery fire and explosions sounding on and off throughout the day as Russian and Ukrainian forces traded blows in a fierce battle for the eastern city.\nUkrainian troops were moving heavy guns and howitzers along the roads toward the frontline, pouring men and armor into the fight as Russian artillery targeted Ukrainian guns.\nRussian rockets pummeled an area near Sievierodonetsk late Friday afternoon, landing with multiple heavy explosions that were audible from a nearby village. Grad missiles streaked through the sky from Ukrainian-held territory toward Russian positions.\nRussian forces have been edging ever closer to seizing Sievierodonetsk and taking total control of the Luhansk region, part of the broader area known as Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. Capturing the industrial Donbas region could give Mr. Putin a victory to herald to the Russian people.\nBut Ukraine on Friday was battling to hang on in Sievierodonetsk, underscoring the government\u2019s determination to resist Russia\u2019s onslaught until the arrival of heavier weapons from the West that could potentially help turn the war in its favor.\nThe head of the Ukrainian military administration in the region, Serhiy Haidai, said Friday that at least one person had been killed in Sievierodonetsk and that the battle was ongoing in the heart of the city. He said that Russian forces maintained their grip on a highway that had acted as a conduit both for people seeking to flee the city as well as for incoming supplies.\nThat highway runs southwest from Sievierodonetsk across the Seversky Donets River, through the adjoining city of Lysychansk and on to the city of Bakmut in Donetsk province.\nRussian artillery has targeted the road, as well as several towns and villages along the route, part of Moscow\u2019s bid to tighten its grip on Luhansk, a province where it already holds almost all of the land. Russia has massed its forces in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in the Donbas region after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, early in the conflict.\nA British intelligence report said on Friday that Russian forces were \u201cachieving tactical success\u201d in Luhansk and had momentum, noting that they should be able to take full control of the province in the next two weeks. Mr. Haidai has disputed that analysis.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The United States, Britain and Germany all said this week they would supply Ukraine with missile systems that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky had sought to offset Russia\u2019s advantage in long-range artillery.</span> But it is not clear when those weapons will arrive or how a possible new Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks will take shape.\nUntil then, Ukrainian attempts to slow Moscow\u2019s progress in the Donbas could deplete Russia of both personnel and arms.\n\u201cRussian forces continued to make incremental, grinding, and costly progress in eastern Ukraine,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Local residents and Ukrainian officials in the area of Sievierodonetsk said Friday that Ukrainian forces were still holding their own \u2014 even pushing back some Russian forces.\nOne Ukrainian reporter for Radio Liberty traveled in with the Ukrainian army across the last standing bridge into the city. Two Reuters journalists were wounded and their driver was killed after their vehicle, which had been provided by Russia-backed forces, came under fire while heading to Sievierodonetsk on a Russian-held part of road, according to the news agency.\nReporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine\nAmidst stretchers, camouflage netting and bloodstained medical gear, Ukrainian soldiers were examined by medical personnel at a makeshift aid station in Bakhmut, only a few miles west of the Donetsk and Luhansk regional border, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Seeking to leverage a global food crisis to get relief from international sanctions, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said on Friday that Ukrainian grain could travel by rail through his country to ports on the Baltic Sea, but only if Belarus is allowed to use the same ports to export its own goods.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Moscow, made the offer in a telephone conversation with the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, according to Belta, the Belarusian state news agency.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Russia has blockaded Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea, which were previously the main export route for Ukrainian grain and oilseeds.</span> The war has left <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 25 million</span> tons of grain stranded in silos and at risk of rotting away unless it is moved soon.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">U.N. officials have warned the blockade will cause rising prices and severe food shortages, particularly in Africa, where famines are possible.</span> Moscow has said it would consider letting grain shipments through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. Ukraine\u2019s allies have been seeking alternative overland routes.\nBelarus controls the railway lines that offer the most direct, cheapest and fastest route for large volumes of grain to be shipped out of Ukraine to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and other Baltic ports.\nBut getting access to those rail lines has been complicated because Belarus is allied with Russia in the current conflict. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Belarus was a staging ground for Russia\u2019s Feb.<span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 invasion</span> of Ukraine, and Mr. Lukashenko has expressed fury at Western sanctions on what had been his country\u2019s biggest export earner, potash fertilizer.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Belarus, which is landlocked, exported nearly all its potash through the port at Klaipeda until Feb.<span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> when Lithuania halted the traffic, severing a vital economic artery for Mr. Lukashenko.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s offer to Mr. Guterres seems to be a gambit to restore that lifeline. Ukraine is desperate to start shipping trapped grain before this year\u2019s harvest adds tens of millions more tons, and Kyiv has been relatively open to a deal with Mr. Lukashenko. Other countries, including Lithuania, however, are strongly opposed to cutting Belarus any slack.\nBelta reported that the U.N. chief had \u201casked for a short pause of a few days to talk with the

The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2023,</span> though the agency cautioned that date could change. Then the agency would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue, which could further delay the policy\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cNicotine is powerfully addictive,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cLowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit.\u201d\n\nThe move would be the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998,</span> when tobacco companies agreed to pay more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $200 billion</span> to help states pay for healthcare. As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to various marketing restrictions, including a ban on free product samples and advertising on billboards.\n\nThe cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 when</span> the pandemic hit. <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 12.5% of</span> adults in the U.S., <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 30.8 million</span> people, were cigarette smokers <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020,</span> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. cigarette sales are expected to drop this year to <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $95 billion</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $99 billion</span> last year, according to Euromonitor International.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The policy would apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S. Imports of traditional cigarettes would be barred but multinational tobacco companies could continue to sell full-nicotine cigarettes in other countries.</span> New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health also has proposed a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes to very low levels as part of a broader plan to curb smoking.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The FDA\u2019s planned rule could sharply decrease U.S. cigarette sales, and tobacco companies intend to fight it.</span> The largest U.S. cigarette makers\u2014Altria Group Inc. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MO 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle and Reynolds American Inc.\u2014sell alternative products such as nicotine pouches, but revenue for both companies comes predominantly from cigarettes.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Altria shares at market close Tuesday had fallen <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 7% since</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10,</span> when The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration planned to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes.\n\n</span>Reynolds and Altria said Tuesday that encouraging smokers to switch to less harmful options was a better approach to improving public health than reducing nicotine in cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe do actually support the overarching goal here, which is to transition smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free products,\u201d said Murray Garnick, Altria\u2019s general counsel. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe just think that the better way is to create a robust market of FDA-authorized smoke-free products.\u201d\n\nMr. Garnick said that the policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels wasn\u2019t achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year.</span> If the policy were effective, he said, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.\n\nNicotine is the addictive chemical that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn\u2019t cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s nicotine-reduction plan is based on more than a decade of government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Smokers of these cigarettes were more likely to quit or seek their nicotine fix from less-harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes or gum compared with smokers who continued using regular cigarettes.\n\nCigarette smoking is the most dangerous way to consume nicotine, according to public health officials. While very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive, researchers say, their smoke still contains most of the same carcinogenic compounds as regular cigarette smoke.\n\nAccording to an FDA study published <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> such a rule would prompt an <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional 13 million</span> adult smokers to quit within five years of implementation.\n\nSmoking is linked to more <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 480,000 deaths</span> in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And tobacco use costs <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $300 billion</span> a year in direct healthcare and lost productivity, the FDA says.\n\n</span>Cigarette industry executives say the science on low-nicotine cigarettes isn\u2019t conclusive. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">They say that such a rule would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and could lead to consumer confusion around the health risks of very low-nicotine cigarettes.</span> There is widespread misunderstanding in the U.S. about the health risks of nicotine. An FDA study <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 found</span> that <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 75% of</span> people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine caused cancer.\n\nBig cigarette companies also say it would take years for them to develop a very low-nicotine cigarette and that it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to manufacture at scale. In the past, tobacco companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. In anticipation of a federal nicotine-reduction rule, Altria and Reynolds have experimented with other ways, including tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.\n\n22nd Century Group Inc., <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">XXII 3.33</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical tobacco plant for a cigarette brand called VLN.

The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2023,</span> though the agency cautioned that date could change. Then the agency would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue, which could further delay the policy\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cNicotine is powerfully addictive,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cLowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit.\u201d\n\nThe move would be the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998,</span> when tobacco companies agreed to pay more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $200 billion</span> to help states pay for healthcare. As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to various marketing restrictions, including a ban on free product samples and advertising on billboards.\n\nThe cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 when</span> the pandemic hit. <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 12.5% of</span> adults in the U.S., <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 30.8 million</span> people, were cigarette smokers <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020,</span> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. cigarette sales are expected to drop this year to <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $95 billion</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $99 billion</span> last year, according to Euromonitor International.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The policy would apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S. Imports of traditional cigarettes would be barred but multinational tobacco companies could continue to sell full-nicotine cigarettes in other countries.</span> New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health also has proposed a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes to very low levels as part of a broader plan to curb smoking.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The FDA\u2019s planned rule could sharply decrease U.S. cigarette sales, and tobacco companies intend to fight it.</span> The largest U.S. cigarette makers\u2014Altria Group Inc. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MO 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle and Reynolds American Inc.\u2014sell alternative products such as nicotine pouches, but revenue for both companies comes predominantly from cigarettes.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Altria shares at market close Tuesday had fallen <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 7% since</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10,</span> when The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration planned to mandate a reduction of nicotine in cigarettes.\n\n</span>Reynolds and Altria said Tuesday that encouraging smokers to switch to less harmful options was a better approach to improving public health than reducing nicotine in cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe do actually support the overarching goal here, which is to transition smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free products,\u201d said Murray Garnick, Altria\u2019s general counsel. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe just think that the better way is to create a robust market of FDA-authorized smoke-free products.\u201d\n\nMr. Garnick said that the policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels wasn\u2019t achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year.</span> If the policy were effective, he said, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.\n\nNicotine is the addictive chemical that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn\u2019t cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s nicotine-reduction plan is based on more than a decade of government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Smokers of these cigarettes were more likely to quit or seek their nicotine fix from less-harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes or gum compared with smokers who continued using regular cigarettes.\n\nCigarette smoking is the most dangerous way to consume nicotine, according to public health officials. While very low-nicotine cigarettes are less addictive, researchers say, their smoke still contains most of the same carcinogenic compounds as regular cigarette smoke.\n\nAccording to an FDA study published <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> such a rule would prompt an <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional 13 million</span> adult smokers to quit within five years of implementation.\n\nSmoking is linked to more <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 480,000 deaths</span> in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And tobacco use costs <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $300 billion</span> a year in direct healthcare and lost productivity, the FDA says.\n\n</span>Cigarette industry executives say the science on low-nicotine cigarettes isn\u2019t conclusive. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">They say that such a rule would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and could lead to consumer confusion around the health risks of very low-nicotine cigarettes.</span> There is widespread misunderstanding in the U.S. about the health risks of nicotine. An FDA study <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 found</span> that <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 75% of</span> people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine caused cancer.\n\nBig cigarette companies also say it would take years for them to develop a very low-nicotine cigarette and that it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to manufacture at scale. In the past, tobacco companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. In anticipation of a federal nicotine-reduction rule, Altria and Reynolds have experimented with other ways, including tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.\n\n22nd Century Group Inc., <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">XXII 3.33</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 95% less</span></span> nicotine than a typical tobacco plant for a cigarette brand called VLN.
