American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That was up <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,\u201d Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cService inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,\u201d James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n- Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors\u2019 expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed\u2019s next increase in interest rates, <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.25 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.72 percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.\n<span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated to slow inflation; the longer interest rates stay high, the more pressure they put on company costs, and the higher the risk that the economy slips into recession.\n</span>\u201cWe think any rally here based on the C.P.I. report will be temporary,\u201d said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe have months if not quarters ahead of us where we need to see much lower levels of inflation, and we think we will get there</span> but it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d\nIsabella Simonetti contributed reporting.",

American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span

down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors\u2019 expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed\u2019s next increase in interest rates, <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.25 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.72 percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.\n<span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated to slow inflation; the longer interest rates stay high, the more pressure they put on company costs, and the higher the risk that the economy slips into recession.\n</span>\u201cWe think any rally here based on the C.P.I. report will be temporary,\u201d said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe have months if not quarters ahead of us where we need to see much lower levels of inflation, and we think we will get there</span> but it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d\nIsabella Simonetti contributed

Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2016.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 shed</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.8%.</span>\n\n</span>Momentum stocks haven\u2019t been as widely held as they are now <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.\n\n</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.\n\n</span>Momentum trades \u201cworked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,\u201d Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16.</span>\n\nStill, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,\u201d said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.\u201d\n\nYet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn\u2019t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2001.</span>\n\n</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand that value cannot die,\u201d she said.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.

The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to

companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden\u2019s competition agenda.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.\n</span><span id=\"15\"

class=\"red\">The administration\u2019s focus on increasing competition \u201cwill spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,\u201d said Brian Deese, who heads the White House\u2019s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">And, he added, it \u201cwill deliver lower prices for Americans right away.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">\u201cDid they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden\u2019s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.\n</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were \u201charming competition in the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration\u2019s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation\u2019s ports and to highlight the companies\u2019 promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.\nOverall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden\u2019s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.\n</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Inflation F.A.Q.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">What is inflation?</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world\u2019s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The commission\u2019s analysis determined that market forces \u2014 particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out \u2014 are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> \u201cI think it has upped our credibility\u201d with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,\u201d the report said.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cBusinesses that face meaningful competition can\u2019t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,\u201d said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute\u2019s president.\n</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and \u201cBig Meat\u201d has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack\u2019s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.\nMr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden\u2019s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.\n\u201cThese markets have been concentrated for a long time,\u201d said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he\u2019s going to fix it now?\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency\u2019s new \u201cFood Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program\u201d that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.\n</span>\u201cThe Biden administration understands this and knows this,\u201d said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington.

Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> \u201cI think it has upped our credibility\u201d with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,\u201d the report said.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cBusinesses that face meaningful competition can\u2019t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,\u201d said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute\u2019s president.\n</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and \u201cBig Meat\u201d has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack\u2019s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.\nMr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden\u2019s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.\n\u201cThese markets have been concentrated for a long time,\u201d said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he\u2019s going to fix it now?\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency\u2019s new \u201cFood Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program\u201d that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.\n</span>\u201cThe Biden administration understands this and knows this,\u201d said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, \u201cI would like to see more.\u201d"}, "38910": {"id": "38910", "text": "<h3>Clinton attacks the GOP on climate change.

To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

Fighting for Domestic Workers\u2019 Rights</span> Why Aren\u2019t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?\nWhat happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents\u2019 home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters</h3>Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters\nA recommendation is expected at Thursday\u2019s meeting, which you can watch below, on whether to authorize a third dose for many recipients of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday, the panel will consider boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.\nA key federal advisory committee is beginning two days of meetings that are expected to strongly influence decisions on whether at least some recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines will soon be eligible for booster shots.\nAfter hearing from Moderna officials, Food and Drug Administration scientists, members of the public and others, the panel of outside experts advising the F.D.A. is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend emergency authorization of a third shot for recipients of Moderna\u2019s vaccine. (You can watch the meeting here.)\nThe panel will vote Friday on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s request for emergency authorization of a second dose. While regulators are not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, they typically do.\nThe panel may be more skeptical of a booster shot for Moderna recipients than for Johnson & Johnson. Some vaccine experts have long argued that Johnson & Johnson should be a two-dose vaccine since its effectiveness is lower than those of the shots produced by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\nPfizer-BioNTech won authorization for a booster shot for many recipients last month after arguing that its vaccine, while highly protective in the early months, lost some potency against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization over time.\nBut Moderna\u2019s potency against hospitalization has held up better over time than Pfizer\u2019s, according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn documents released Tuesday, Moderna did not argue that its vaccine requires a booster to prevent severe disease or hospitalization. Instead, it concentrated its arguments on preventing infection and mild to moderate disease.\nModerna said the mean antibody level of participants in its study <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 1.8 times</span> higher after the booster than it was after the second shot. In another measurement, the booster raised neutralizing antibodies at least fourfold <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 87.9 percent</span> of people compared to after the second dose, narrowly failing to meet the agency\u2019s requirement <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 88.4 percent</span>.\nGiven that Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to still strongly protect against severe disease, at least some committee members are expected to balk at recommending a third dose. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be a slam dunk,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, of the panel\u2019s vote. \u201cMaybe we should wait a little bit longer on Moderna, let it drop off more first before we boost.\u201d\nOne of the first presentations Thursday will come from Israeli health officials, who will discuss results of their booster campaign using Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.\nThe Biden administration has been closely watching Israel\u2019s experience because the country has a nationalized health care system that allows it to closely track recipients. The Israeli officials are expected to say that rates of infection and serious disease are significantly lower among those who got a booster shot than among those who did not. Israel\u2019s definition of severe disease is significantly broader than the one used in the United States.\nSince Israel\u2019s data deal only with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, it is not clear how much weight committee members will give it. But it will provide them with more information than they had last month before voting to recommend a booster for a broad swath of Pfizer recipients.\nIsraeli scientists analyzed rates of infection and severe illness <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">among 4.6 million</span> people from <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 30,</span> when the country first began offering booster shots, to Oct.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span> They found that infection rates at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 days</span> after a third injection were five- to 11-fold lower among the boosted population than among those who did not receive an extra injection.\nRates of severe illness were<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span>5-fold lower for <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">those 60 years</span> or older and threefold lower for those <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">aged 40 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> the researchers said.

Each day will culminate in a vote by the panel on whether to recommend emergency authorization for that booster for recipients of that vaccine.\nSo what happens after the panel votes? There are further steps at the F.D.A., then steps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the process ends with the states. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:\nThe F.D.A.\nThe F.D.A., a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services that controls and supervises medications and other elements related to public health, takes up the advisory panel\u2019s recommendation, which includes the question of who should be eligible. The advisory panel\u2019s votes are not binding, but the F.D.A. typically follows them.\nThe F.D.A.\u2019s top official \u2014 its acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock \u2014 issues the agency\u2019s final determination on whether to authorize the boosters and for whom. Such decisions are typically issued within a few days of advisory committee meetings.\nThe C.D.C.\nAn advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States\u2019 public health agency, reviews the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. On Thursday and Friday of next week, that panel is scheduled to meet and vote on its recommendations regarding boosters.\nThe C.D.C. takes up that panel\u2019s recommendations, and the agency\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, issues the agency\u2019s guidance on whether boosters should be used and who should be eligible. That guidance is deeply influential for states, doctors, pharmacies and other health care institutions and the general public. As with the process at the F.D.A., the panel\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the C.D.C. usually follows them.\nHowever, there was a rare exception last month: When a C.D.C. advisory panel rejected the F.D.A.\u2019s recommendation that frontline workers be included among those eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, Dr. Walensky overrode her own agency\u2019s advisers and sided with the F.D.A.\nThe states\nState health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C. In the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, the shots began being administered widely immediately after Dr. Walensky announced the C.D.C.\u2019s guidance to allow them for people <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 65,</span> patients in nursing homes and other institutional settings, those with underlying medical conditions, and frontline workers.\nKyrie Irving, the N.B.A. star who has been indefinitely barred from practicing or playing with the Brooklyn Nets because of his refusal to get the Covid-19 vaccine, spoke out publicly on Wednesday night for the first time since the team decided to keep him off the court, saying his refusal was a matter of personal freedom.\n\u201cYou think I really want to lose money?\u201d Irving, who is set to earn <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $40 million</span> in salary this season, said on his Instagram feed in a meandering monologue that included incorrect medical information. More <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span> of players in the league are vaccinated, a proportion much higher than in the general population of the United States.\n\u201cYou think I really want to give up on my dream to go after a championship?\u201d Irving,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 29,</span> said. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou think I really just want to give up my job?</span> You think I really want to sit at home?\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the Nets said they had barred Irving from playing until he becomes \u201celigible to be a full participant.\u201d New York City requires most teenagers and adults to have at least one vaccination shot to enter facilities such as sports arenas, and Irving has not practiced with the Nets in Brooklyn. Irving joined the Nets <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 as</span> they built a team of superstars that includes Kevin Durant and James Harden.\nIrving asked that his decision to remain unvaccinated be respected and said that he has no plans to retire. He couched his refusal to get vaccinated in his opposition to mandates, saying nobody should be \u201cforced\u201d to do it.\nIrving falsely claimed his decision to remain unvaccinated does not harm other people. The highly contagious Delta variant has quickly spread in areas with low vaccination rates. And hospitals in those areas have been overrun with unvaccinated patients, leaving few beds and staff members to treat other patients.\nBy the time vaccines for the coronavirus were introduced late last year, the pandemic had taken two of Lucenia Williams Dunn\u2019s close friends. Still, Ms. Dunn, the former mayor of Tuskegee, contemplated for months whether to be inoculated.\nIt was a complicated consideration, framed by the government\u2019s botched response to the pandemic, its disproportionate toll on Black communities and an infamous 40-year government experiment for which her hometown is often associated.\n\u201cI thought about the vaccine most every day,\u201d said Ms. Dunn,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 78,</span> who finally walked into a pharmacy this summer and rolled up her sleeve for a shot, convinced after weighing with her family and doctor the possible consequences of remaining unvaccinated.\n\u201cWhat people need to understand is some of the hesitancy is rooted in a horrible history, and for some, it\u2019s truly a process of asking the right questions to get to a place of getting the vaccine.\u201d\nIn the first months after the vaccine rollout, Black Americans were far less likely than white Americans to be vaccinated. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining shots in their communities, their hesitancy was fueled by a powerful combination of general mistrust of the government and medical institutions, and misinformation over the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.\nBut a wave of pro-vaccine campaigns and a surge of virus hospitalizations and deaths this summer, mostly among the unvaccinated and caused by the highly contagious Delta variant, have narrowed the gap, experts say. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">So, too, have the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s full approval of a vaccine and new employer mandates.</span> A steadfast resistance to vaccines in some white communities may also have contributed to the lessening disparity.\nSouth Korea plans to ship <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 1.6 million</span> doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine to Vietnam and Thailand this week, the foreign ministry announced Tuesday, as the Southeast Asian nations struggle to contain the spread of the virus.\nThe donation comes as South Korea\u2019s vaccination program has accelerated rapidly, <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the population expected to be inoculated by the end of the month.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 62 percent</span> of South Korea\u2019s total population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the nation is expected to ease the most severe restrictions by next month.

Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters</h3>Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters\nA recommendation is expected at Thursday\u2019s meeting, which you can watch below, on whether to authorize a third dose for many recipients of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday, the panel will consider boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.\nA key federal advisory committee is beginning two days of meetings that are expected to strongly influence decisions on whether at least some recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines will soon be eligible for booster shots.\nAfter hearing from Moderna officials, Food and Drug Administration scientists, members of the public and others, the panel of outside experts advising the F.D.A. is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend emergency authorization of a third shot for recipients of Moderna\u2019s vaccine. (You can watch the meeting here.)\nThe panel will vote Friday on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s request for emergency authorization of a second dose. While regulators are not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, they typically do.\nThe panel may be more skeptical of a booster shot for Moderna recipients than for Johnson & Johnson. Some vaccine experts have long argued that Johnson & Johnson should be a two-dose vaccine since its effectiveness is lower than those of the shots produced by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\nPfizer-BioNTech won authorization for a booster shot for many recipients last month after arguing that its vaccine, while highly protective in the early months, lost some potency against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization over time.\nBut Moderna\u2019s potency against hospitalization has held up better over time than Pfizer\u2019s, according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn documents released Tuesday, Moderna did not argue that its vaccine requires a booster to prevent severe disease or hospitalization. Instead, it concentrated its arguments on preventing infection and mild to moderate disease.\nModerna said the mean antibody level of participants in its study <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 1.8 times</span> higher after the booster than it was after the second shot. In another measurement, the booster raised neutralizing antibodies at least fourfold <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 87.9 percent</span> of people compared to after the second dose, narrowly failing to meet the agency\u2019s requirement <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 88.4 percent</span>.\nGiven that Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to still strongly protect against severe disease, at least some committee members are expected to balk at recommending a third dose. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be a slam dunk,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, of the panel\u2019s vote. \u201cMaybe we should wait a little bit longer on Moderna, let it drop off more first before we boost.\u201d\nOne of the first presentations Thursday will come from Israeli health officials, who will discuss results of their booster campaign using Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.\nThe Biden administration has been closely watching Israel\u2019s experience because the country has a nationalized health care system that allows it to closely track recipients. The Israeli officials are expected to say that rates of infection and serious disease are significantly lower among those who got a booster shot than among those who did not. Israel\u2019s definition of severe disease is significantly broader than the one used in the United States.\nSince Israel\u2019s data deal only with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, it is not clear how much weight committee members will give it.

Bitcoin backers\u2019 rallying cry to rebuff skeptics was, \u201cHave fun staying poor.\u201d Those who didn\u2019t buy in were letting the future pass them by.\nAt times, crypto has looked like a combination of Beanie Babies, dot-com stocks and the Velvet Underground: It is manic, it is money, and all the cool people are into it. It has also shared characteristics with other bubbles throughout history, marked by speculation bordering on delusion, disregard and disrespect for risk, and greed.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Now, with markets sliding and inflation plaguing the global economy, cryptocurrencies have been among the first assets sold.</span> Since bitcoin hit an all-time high in November, <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $2 trillion</span> of cryptocurrency value\u2014more than two-thirds of all the crypto that existed\u2014has been erased.

When the dust settles, some crypto products and companies may no longer exist.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe reality is that like stock, with crypto, everyone is a genius in a bull market,\u201d said Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire during the dot-com boom in the \u201990s and has more recently invested in a number of crypto projects.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cNow that prices are falling for both, those companies that were unnaturally sustained by easy money will go away.\u201d\n</span>The fever pitch\nBitcoin was launched as a form of electronic money <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 by</span> an anonymous creator who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Its price rose\u2014unsteadily, haphazardly, often violently and with big crashes sprinkled throughout\u2014as more people jumped in.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Numerous factors drove the rise, but crypto investors often shared a belief that the existing financial system had failed and crypto was the future.\n</span>In <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2021,</span> the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., went public with <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $85 billion</span> valuation, becoming the first major bitcoin-focused public company. It was viewed as a watershed moment for the crypto world.\nIn August, the city of Miami debuted MiamiCoin, a city-branded cryptocurrency.\nThe cryptocurrency complex pushed individual investors hard to join in. Crypto.com\u2019s spot featuring Mr. James was one of several crypto ads that ran during this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Ads for crypto companies are now splashed across Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 uniforms and several major-league and college-sports venues. Coinbase ran an ad during the NBA Finals.\nIn <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2020,</span> well-known hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones revealed that he had a small portion of his assets in bitcoin, and called it a \u201cgreat speculation.\u201d <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At the time, bitcoin was trading <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $9,000.</span></span> Other professional investors followed. Bill Miller. Alan Howard. Stanley Druckenmiller. Suddenly, crypto was OK for the mainstream, it appeared.\nLast December, the red letters spelling out \u201cStaples Center\u201d were pulled down from the famed Los Angeles venue, replaced by new signs reading \u201cCrypto.com Arena,\u201d after <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $700 million</span> naming-rights deal, believed to be the biggest in history.\nEarlier this year, more <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 25,000 people</span> showed up for a Miami crypto conference, a slew of events across the city and the endless parties. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez presided over the unveiling of an 11-foot long,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,000</span>-pound, black, techno-styled bull, to rival New York\u2019s famous one on Wall Street. The centerpiece at the conference\u2019s expo hall was a giant, smoking, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 volcano. A party at the Versace mansion featured live music and synchronized swimmers.\nThe panels and speakers raved about bitcoin and its future. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor, who leveraged his business-software company and put more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100,000 bitcoins</span>, worth more <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 billion</span> at the peak, on its balance sheet, said: \u201cI am more bullish than ever on bitcoin.\u201d</span> ARK Investment CEO Cathie Wood said bitcoin would rise to more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 million</span>. PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel suggested bitcoiners should make an \u201cenemies list\u201d of people opposed to the cryptocurrency.\nAt that conference and others, \u201cyou could see this certain amount of euphoria and sense of invincibility,\u201d said Dan Gunsberg, who started investing in bitcoin <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span> today is the chief executive at crypto-based Hxro Network. Mr. Gunsberg said he knew the ebullience was a sign of trouble: \u201cNothing that moves that fast, that parabolic, can stay high. Gravity pulls it back to earth.\u201d\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The crash\nAs fear of inflation rages, traders and investors are dumping assets in their portfolio that they deem risky.</span> Shares of unprofitable companies have dropped swiftly, with many newly public technology companies losing more than half their value in the first half of the year. Also high on the sell list: crypto.\nSo far this year, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value and currently trades at its lowest level since <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2020.</span> Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, has fallen <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 68% so</span> far this year.\n\u201cThere was absolutely a lot of hubris across a lot of asset classes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That led to a lot of greed and unsustainable business models and a lot of leverage in crypto.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s collapsing now,\u201d said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, a crypto-focused financial-services firm.</span> \u201cA large number of crypto funds will not survive this.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Many don\u2019t appreciate the degree to which the sector\u2019s growth has been aided by a long-running bull market in stocks and the market-juicing policies of the world\u2019s central banks, said Joel Kruger, a strategist at asset exchange LMAX Digital.</span> It was the very system crypto sought to replace.\n\u201cThe irony of it all is the easy-money conditions since <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 crisis</span> have lent themselves to the greatest period of risk-taking we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Kruger said. \u201cThat benefited cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nThe fallout\nIn retrospect, Mr. Jones\u2019s \u201cgreat speculation\u201d remark may end up being the most prescient comment on bitcoin. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The braggadocio that marked so much of the crypto world is fading as those easy-money policies have been reversed and the bull market in stocks has disappeared.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The carnage has spread from the cryptocurrencies themselves to companies that provide services in the market.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">For exchanges, trading activity drives the majority of their business, and with the selloff, revenues have fallen.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Coinbase reported <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $429.7 million</span> first-quarter loss in May and said its users were fleeing the platform, even as its executives sold stock and pocketed profits.</span> In June, for the first time since its founding <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span></span></span> it laid off staff\u2014nearly one-fifth of its workforce. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Its stock now trades <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $51,</span> compared with its high <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $429.54 on</span> its first day of trading on <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 14,</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021.</span></span> Gemini, BlockFi, and big-spending Crypto.com have also let staffers go.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In early May, persistent downward pressure in the crypto market broke something big: the stablecoin terraUSD, a cryptocurrency meant to hold a <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">steady $1 value</span>, collapsed due to what was essentially a run on the bank, taking along with it its sister coin, Luna.</span> Almost overnight,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $40 billion</span> worth of the two cryptocurrencies were gone. That collapse has had downstream effects. Earlier in June, a large crypto-lending service called Celsius Network LLC, which had <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $12 billion</span> in user assets, froze withdrawals. The money is currently still locked up and the company has hired a law firm to try to work through its obligations and debts. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Another lender, Babel Finance, on Friday suspended withdrawals and redemptions.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital Ltd. has been considering strategic options, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, including asset sales or a rescue by another firm, after it suffered major losses.\n</span>Despite the losses, some investors remain optimistic. Marshall Johnson Jr., a 54-year-old education-television producer in Maryland, started buying bitcoin <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> when it was <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $38,000.</span> His plan at the time was to slowly put in enough money to own one full bitcoin. He still believes in bitcoin\u2019s future, and hasn\u2019t changed his plan despite the selloff and despite the fact that on paper he has lost money. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">In fact, given the drop in price, he figures he\u2019ll reach his goal sooner.\n</span>\u201cI\u2019m closer than I was a year ago,\u201d he said, laughing.\nC.J. Wilson first heard of bitcoin <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> At the time, he was a Major League Baseball pitcher who lived in California and had spent his downtime buying and selling silver bars and gold coins. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">He said he viewed the digital currency with skepticism because he wasn\u2019t sure how currency could be created on a computer.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2019,</span> after he retired from MLB, however, he read the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on bitcoin and was intrigued.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">A self-described insomniac, Mr. Wilson said he began trading bitcoin in the middle of the night, and soon started dabbling in other cryptocurrencies.</span> \u201cSometimes you just look at them and think that\u2019s a cool name,\u201d he said. He attended crypto conferences all over the world, from San Francisco to London to Las Vegas.\nMr. Wilson eventually refocused his attention on bitcoin. This past year, though, he said he started noticing signs of froth. When Crypto.com sponsored the Lakers\u2019 arena, he started wondering, \u201cWhere are they getting all this money from?\u201d He said he received invitations to yacht parties from people who had made it big in crypto. He noticed Coinbase\u2019s CEO, Brian Armstrong, bought a home in California <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $133 million</span>. At the bitcoin conference in Miami this spring, he attended a glitzy party hosted by Gemini at a mansion.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo me, it makes you realize that was probably the top of the market,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Mr. Wilson said he still believes in bitcoin, but this spring he started trading bitcoin more than simply holding it.\n</span>The current flushing-out of the crypto world strikes some investors as similar to the late-1990s and internet companies. On the one hand, investors were correct during that bubble: The internet was the future. But that didn\u2019t stop many of them from losing boatloads of money as hundreds of internet companies failed.\n\u201cLong-term, we\u2019re huge believers in crypto,\u201d said Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who invests in crypto. \u201cBut short-term, watch out.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Kelly Miller,<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35,</span> was a professional musician in San Francisco. <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">He watched his income go to zero as the world shut down, and started investing in stocks through Robinhood Markets Inc.</span> In <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2021 he</span> decided to try buying some crypto coins, and purchased some dogecoin. He watched his small purchase soar in value before swiftly falling back. Despite the roller coaster, Mr. Kelly, who now lives in Istanbul, said he was hooked. Over the past year and a half, he\u2019s bought bitcoin, Ethereum and solana, among others, with the most of his money in solana, he said. The latest downturn, which has hurt his portfolio, drove home to him the need for changes in the crypto world.\n\u201cThis space needs to be regulated, it needs to be safe for consumers,\u201d he said. He said he believes there\u2019s a lot of value in the underlying technology, and in NFTs in particular, but he said he\u2019s worried selloffs like this current crypto winter will erode trust among investors.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have any exposure to crypto?

It was a sign to him of just how widespread the phenomenon had gotten. \u201cI get recognized on the street?

surge of oil production is coming, whether the world needs it or not.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The flood of crude will arrive even as concerns about climate change are growing and worldwide oil demand is slowing.</span> And it is not coming from the usual producers, but from Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana \u2014 countries that are either not known for oil or whose production has been lackluster in recent years.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">This looming new supply may be a key reason Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant oil producer, Aramco, pushed ahead on Sunday with plans for what could

efforts to lower emissions, will almost certainly push oil prices down.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Lower prices could prove damaging for Aramco and many other oil companies, reducing profits

economic relief to consumers at the gas pump and to importing nations like China, India and Japan.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But cheaper oil may complicate efforts to combat global warming

Yergin, the energy historian who wrote \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Power and Money,\u201d compared the impact of the new production to the advent of the shale oil boom in Texas and North Dakota a decade ago.\n\u201cSince all four of these countries are largely insulated from traditional geopolitical turmoil, they will add to global energy security,\u201d Mr. Yergin said. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But he also predicted that as with shale, the incremental supply gain, combined with a sluggish world economy, could drive prices lower.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">There is already a glut on the world market, even with exports from Venezuela and Iran sharply curtailed by American sanctions.</span> Should their production come back, that glut would only expand.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Years of moderate gasoline prices have already increased the popularity of bigger cars and sports utility vehicles in the United States, and the probability of more oil on the market is bound to weigh on prices at the pump over the next few years.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The oil-supply outlook is a sharp departure from the early 2000s, when prices soared as producers strained to keep up with ballooning demand in China and some analysts warned that the world was running out of oil.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Then came the rise of hydraulic fracturing and drilling through tight shale fields, which converted the United States from a needy importer into a powerful exporter.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The increase in American production, along with a choppy global economy, shaved oil prices from well <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $100 a</span> barrel before the 2007-9 recession to <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $56 on</span> Friday for the American benchmark crude.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Those low prices have

for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.\n</span>\u201cThis could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,\u201d said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics.</span> Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.\nProduction of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.\n\u201cLegacy decisions keep going,\u201d said John Browne, BP\u2019s former chief executive. \u201cThings happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.\u201d\nThe added production in Norway comes despite the country\u2019s embrace of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 Paris</span> climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.\nEquinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, \u201cThe Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s rebound <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 19 years</span> of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">produce 440,000 barrels</span> a day, increasing the country\u2019s output <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1.3 million</span> barrels a day <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.6 million</span> next year <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1.8 million</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021.</span></span>\nIn Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 300,000 barrels</span> a day, and the country is expected to add as much <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 460,000 more</span> barrels a day by the end <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 15 billion</span> barrels of reserves.\nIn Canada, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,000</span>-mile <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Line 3 pipeline</span> that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span>.\nAnd the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reach 120,000 barrels</span> a day early next year, rising to at <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 750,000 barrels</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2025,</span> and more is expected after that.\nGuyana potentially has the most complicated future of the four countries. Its ethnically divided politics are sometimes turbulent, and Venezuela claims a large portion of its territory. But with the oil fields miles offshore, drilling is largely protected. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In addition, Venezuela is mired in a political and economic crisis and unlikely to challenge a Chinese state company which has an oil investment in Guyana, along with Exxon Mobil and Hess.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Energy experts say the new production from the four nations will more than satisfy all the growth in global demand expected over the next two years, which is well below the growth rates of recent years before economic expansion in China, Europe and Latin America slowed.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">At the same time, new pipelines in Texas are expected to increase United States exports <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3.3 million</span> barrels a day next year, from the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">current 2.8 million</span>.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">That adds up to a vast surplus unless there is a resurgence of global economic growth to stimulate demand, or a prolonged conflict in the Middle East or other disruption to supply.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo support prices, OPEC is going to have to extend and probably deepen their production cuts for a while,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, a top State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cGetting the prices up to the point where Aramco can launch its I.P.O. is a big Saudi priority.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The new barrels on the world market will also put pressure on companies producing in the United States, where profit margins for shale production are slim at current price levels and stock prices are falling.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf I was in the business I would be scared to death,\u201d said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.</span> \u201cThe industry is going to face capital starvation.\u201d\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">American oil executives express concern that drilling will fade in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado as oil prices drop to as low <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $50 a</span> barrel in the next few years.</span> Small companies are expected to merge, while others go bankrupt.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u2018This Is the Most Lonesome Job\u2019: Ride With a \u2018Hot Shot\u2019 Oilfield Trucker in Texas\nAs the United States has become the world\u2019s largest producer of oil, demand in the fields has soared for pipes or drums in a hurry.</span> That\u2019s where Mike Wilkinson fits in.\nScott D. Sheffield, chief executive of the Texas-based producer Pioneer Natural Resources, said he expected the growth of United States oil production to ease <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1.2 million</span> barrels a day this year <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 500,000 barrels</span> next year and <span

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018.</span>\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Sheffield said he was optimistic, in part because new supplies coming to market could be offset by production declines in older fields in Mexico and elsewhere <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 2021.</span>\n</span>\u201cThere are no more big, giant new projects except Guyana,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to be patient for a couple of more

for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.\n</span>\u201cThis could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,\u201d said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics.</span> Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.\nProduction of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.\n\u201cLegacy decisions keep going,\u201d said John Browne, BP\u2019s former chief executive. \u201cThings happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.\u201d\nThe added production in Norway comes despite the country\u2019s embrace of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 Paris</span> climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.\nEquinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, \u201cThe Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s rebound <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 19 years</span> of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">produce 440,000 barrels</span> a day, increasing the country\u2019s output <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1.3 million</span> barrels a day <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.6 million</span> next year <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1.8 million</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021.</span></span>\nIn Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 300,000 barrels</span> a day, and the country is expected to add as much <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 460,000 more</span> barrels a day by the end <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 15 billion</span> barrels of reserves.\nIn Canada, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,000</span>-mile <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Line 3 pipeline</span> that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span>.\nAnd the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reach 120,000 barrels</span> a day early next year, rising to at <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 750,000 barrels</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2025,</span> and more is expected after that.\nGuyana potentially has the most complicated future of the four countries. Its ethnically divided politics are sometimes turbulent, and Venezuela claims a large portion of its territory. But with the oil fields miles offshore, drilling is largely protected. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In addition, Venezuela is mired in a political and economic crisis and unlikely to challenge a Chinese state company which has an oil investment in Guyana, along with Exxon Mobil and Hess.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Energy experts say the new production from the four nations will more than satisfy all the growth in global demand expected over the next two years, which is well below the growth rates of recent years before economic expansion in China, Europe and Latin America slowed.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">At the same time, new pipelines in Texas are expected to increase United States exports <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3.3 million</span> barrels a day next year, from the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">current 2.8 million</span>.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">That adds up to a vast surplus unless there is a resurgence of global economic growth to stimulate demand, or a prolonged conflict in the Middle East or other disruption to supply.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo support prices, OPEC is going to have to extend and probably deepen their production cuts for a while,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, a top State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cGetting the prices up to the point where Aramco can launch its I.P.O. is a big Saudi priority.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The new barrels on the world market will also put pressure on companies producing in the United States, where profit margins for shale production are slim at current price levels and stock prices are falling.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf I was in the business I would be scared to death,\u201d said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.</span> \u201cThe industry is going to face capital starvation.\u201d\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">American oil executives express concern that drilling will fade in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado as oil prices drop to as low <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $50 a</span> barrel in the next few years.</span> Small companies are expected to merge, while others go bankrupt.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u2018This Is the Most Lonesome Job\u2019: Ride With a \u2018Hot Shot\u2019 Oilfield Trucker in Texas\nAs the United States has become the world\u2019s largest producer of oil, demand in the fields has soared for pipes or drums in a hurry.</span> That\u2019s where Mike Wilkinson fits in.\nScott D.

visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. \"You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,\" she said.\n\nMr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.\n\nCrude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha\u2014groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.\n\n</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad\u2014but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.\n\nMr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.\n\n\"If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,\" he said.\n\nAyman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.\n\nIn normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.\n\nInside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.\n\nMost of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are \"temporarily\" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.\n\n</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.\n\nMr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, \"Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>\"\n\nAlthough the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8",

visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. \"You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,\" she said.\n\nMr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.\n\nCrude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha\u2014groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.\n\n</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad\u2014but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.\n\nMr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.\n\n\"If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,\" he said.\n\nAyman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.\n\nIn normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.\n\nInside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.\n\nMost of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are \"temporarily\" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.\n\n</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.\n\nMr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, \"Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>\"\n\nAlthough the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"},

id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nSupported by\nPlunge in Lira, Turkey\u2019s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion\nTurkey\u2019s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.\nRising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes.</span> A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Turkey\u2019s central bank insisted over the weekend that it would \u201ctake all necessary measures\u201d to preserve the country\u2019s financial stability.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But it has so far refused to raise interest rates, and the changes it has pushed through thus far have been limited in scope.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">After the Turkish lira fell even further \u2014 one dollar <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">bought 3.8 liras</span> at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth 7.2 liras</span> \u2014 investors dumped other emerging-market currencies.</span> The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost 2 percent</span> after falling <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 6 percent</span> last week.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 2 percent</span></span> during the day.</span> European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">In early trading on Wall Street, the S.&P.<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 500 stock</span>-index <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 0.7 percent</span>, but quickly recovered and turned positive.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cTurkey\u2019s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.\n</span>Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country \u2014 in this case, Turkey \u2014 can quickly spread to other regions.\n</span>Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country\u2019s prospects. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank\u2019s independence.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Normally, a country in Turkey\u2019s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency\u2019s slide.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as \u2018risk off\u2019 toward emerging markets,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.\n</span>But \u201cTurkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">On Monday, Turkey\u2019s central bank relaxed some of its rules on the money that commercial banks must keep on reserve, freeing up cash to deal with the currency crisis.</span> The central bank also said that it would provide \u201call the liquidity the banks need.\u201d\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 17.75 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.\n</span>In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">\u201cDo not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cYou would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists\u2019 and merchants\u2019 responsibility to keep this nation on its feet.

The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.\nYasmim Vit\u00f3ria de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful and she lets us have fun,\u201d the 9-year-old said.\nMs. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.\n\u201cIn a moment of tragedy, we\u2019ve been able to share moments of love,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThat is very powerful \u2014 Ernesto Londo\u00f1o and Manuela Andreoni\nINDIA\nWhen India\u2019s lockdown hit . . .\n. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.\n\u201cWho else would take care of them?\u201d he said. \u2014 Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj\nITALY\nWhen an Italian bookstore appealed . . .\n. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.\n\u201cWe wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,\u201d said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.\nThe idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers \u2014 and with luck a few volunteers \u2014 would read to people for <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. \u201cWe were thinking small,\u201d she said.\nBut the response was overwhelming.\nAfter the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.\nFor good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">children<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.\nSome of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.\nBut Mr. Asadi,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,</span> has <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.\nThen, the coronavirus came to Britain.\nWith older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard\u2019s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.\nFor a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because I live alone,\u201d he said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd you get fed up with your own company.\u201d\n</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.\nThen, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.\n\u201cI was most surprised,\u201d he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">day 1 of</span> Britain\u2019s mass inoculation program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it any thought really.

The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.\nYasmim Vit\u00f3ria de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful and she lets us have fun,\u201d the 9-year-old said.\nMs. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.\n\u201cIn a moment of tragedy, we\u2019ve been able to share moments of love,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThat is very powerful \u2014 Ernesto Londo\u00f1o and Manuela Andreoni\nINDIA\nWhen India\u2019s lockdown hit . . .\n. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.\n\u201cWho else would take care of them?\u201d he said. \u2014 Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj\nITALY\nWhen an Italian bookstore appealed . . .\n. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.\n\u201cWe wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,\u201d said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.\nThe idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers \u2014 and with luck a few volunteers \u2014 would read to people for <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. \u201cWe were thinking small,\u201d she said.\nBut the response was overwhelming.\nAfter the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.\nFor good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">children<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.\nSome of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.\nBut Mr. Asadi,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,</span> has <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.\nThen, the coronavirus came to Britain.\nWith older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard\u2019s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.\nFor a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because I live alone,\u201d he said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd you get fed up with your own company.\u201d\n</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain.

And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.\n\u201cI was most surprised,\u201d he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">day 1 of</span> Britain\u2019s mass inoculation program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it any thought really.

Inspectors \u201cpromptly visited the site but were expelled from the property,\u201d state officials said in a written statement. \u201cWe have significant concerns about conditions in this facility.\u201d\nMore <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800 residents</span> from seven different nursing homes had been moved to the Tangipahoa Parish facility, and state officials said they are working to find safe placements for them, beginning with the most vulnerable.\nAs of Thursday morning,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 721 had</span> been moved. A dozen of those required hospitalization.\n\u201cWe will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement,\u201d the State Department of Health said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disheartening,\u201d said Robby Miller, the Tangipahoa Parish president.\nMr. Miller called the incident is a cautionary tale for others with family members in nursing homes in Louisiana: The conditions and quality of care at an evacuation facility may not be as good as in a typical nursing home.\nSome of the nursing home residents have now been moved to a state facility run by Louisiana State University in Alexandria, Mr. Miller said.\nThe news came as officials in New Orleans announced on Thursday that they were organizing a voluntary evacuation option for residents hoping to get out of the city, which remains largely without electricity.\nDetails of that plan are still in the works, but it would allow residents to be taken to a state-run shelter outside the city, said Collin Arnold, the New Orleans director of homeland security.\nThe city would give priority to elderly and disabled residents and then make the option available to the general public, he said.\nAcross Louisiana, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately 594,000 customers</span> remained without power on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the electric utility Entergy. By early afternoon,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,000 power</span> customers in New Orleans had their electricity restored, said Ramsey Green, the city\u2019s deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Entergy hoped to restore full power to the French Quarter and central business district by late Thursday, he said.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of 27 electric</span> substations in New Orleans, Mr. Green said,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13 are</span> back online.\nMayor LaToya Cantrell, speaking at an afternoon briefing, noted that in addition to electricity, access to fuel continues to be a challenge for city residents. \u201cWe just have not received adequate fueling sources to the general public.\u201d Ms. Cantrell promised that \u201cwhen we get more we shall share more.\u201d\nThe storm that ripped through southeastern Louisiana on Sunday left a still-untold number of people without homes and wreaked havoc on other essential services. Hundreds of thousands of people found themselves in places where water infrastructure was badly damaged by the storm and pumps and treatment plants were left without power.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">President Biden, who is expected to visit the state on Friday, said the flash floods that inundated New York City and the powerful winds that knocked out power in Louisiana were a sign that \u201cextreme storms and the climate crisis are here\u201d and that the storms and fires creating life-or-death situations across the country constituted \u201cone of the great challenges of our time.\u201d\n\u201cHurricane Ida didn\u2019t care if you were a Democrat or Republican, rural or urban,\u201d Mr. Biden said Thursday, urging Congress to pass his economic agenda when it returned from its recess later this month, in order to provide critical investments in electrical infrastructure.</span> \u201cThis destruction is everywhere. And it\u2019s a matter of life and death, and we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\nIn the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.\nIn Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.\n\u201cThis has become basic-level subsistence,\u201d said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.\nThis was life, upended, in much of the region \u2014 an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.\nAt a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was \u201ca broken community\u201d that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.\n\u201cI had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.\u201d\nSOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. \u2014 There were several flare-ups during a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.\nIt was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.\n\u201cI feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what\u2019s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,\u201d said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019m just worried sick.\u201d\nOn Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.\nConditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.\n\u201cThis is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it\u2019s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire\u2019s edge now,\u201d he said.\nOther firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.\nFirefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.\nAfter the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.\n\u201cThe weather has been working in our favor,\u201d said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. \u201cLook at the Dixie fire.\u201d\nFirefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake\u2019s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.\nThe blaze, which <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and \u201csquirrelly winds\u201d in the Kirkwood area.\nBut so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.\nThomas Fuller and\nAdvertisement\nThe Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.\nMore <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews \u2014 sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain \u2014 build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.\n\u201cIt becomes \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019\u201d said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing \u2014 Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.\nBy Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay.

Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.\nBefore you give, do your research.\nNatural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.\n</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.\nDonations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.\nIf you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.\nHere are some local organizations in the storm area.\nAll Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.\nThe Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.\nCulture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin\u2019 Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.\nAirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.\nSBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.\nA number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana\u2019s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.\nBayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.\nLouisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.\nNational organizations are lending a hand.\nAmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.\nMercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida\u2019s wake and is accepting donations.\nGoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.\nProject HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies.

And it\u2019s a matter of life and death, and we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\nIn the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.\nIn Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.\n\u201cThis has become basic-level subsistence,\u201d said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.\nThis was life, upended, in much of the region \u2014 an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.\nAt a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was \u201ca broken community\u201d that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.\n\u201cI had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.\u201d\nSOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. \u2014 There were several flare-ups during a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.\nIt was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.\n\u201cI feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what\u2019s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,\u201d said the Rev.

Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.\nFirefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.\nAfter the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.\n\u201cThe weather has been working in our favor,\u201d said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. \u201cLook at the Dixie fire.\u201d\nFirefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake\u2019s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.\nThe blaze, which <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and \u201csquirrelly winds\u201d in the Kirkwood area.\nBut so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.\nThomas Fuller and\nAdvertisement\nThe Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.\nMore <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews \u2014 sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain \u2014 build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest.

Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns \u2014 and were still rising.\nOfficials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.\nTens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.\n\u201cAl Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,\u201d said Frank Feingold,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.\nThe Schuylkill had reached the \u201cmajor\u201d flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.\n\u201cWe are still doing water rescues across the city; we\u2019ve done that for the <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 15 hours</span> now continually,\u201d Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. \u201cWe know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 100 years</span>,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.\u201d\nThe mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. \u201cExtreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.\u201d\nIn Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L\u2019angolo. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.\n\u201cIt was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came halfway up the windows.\u201d\nSome of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that \u201cthe size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,\u201d with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.\n\u201cAfter last night\u2019s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,\u201d said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. \u201cBoth waterways have already surpassed all-time records.\u201d\nIn Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.\nThe Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">got 10 inches</span> of rain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,\u201d Mr. DiGirolamo said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.\nOne of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.\n</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.\n\u201cFor me it was just like a flash,\u201d said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. \u201cWe tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.\u201d\nWhen he came outside, he found his neighbor\u2019s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink.

Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 150 miles</span> per hour. Some rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were still rising.\nIda\u2019s remnants brought historic hourly rainfall to New York and New Jersey.\nEach bar represents one recorded hour of precipitation in Newark.\nThe rain broke records set <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 11 days</span> before by Tropical Storm Henri, underscoring warnings from climate scientists of a new normal on a warmed planet: Hotter air holds more water and allows storms to gather strength more quickly and grow ever larger.\nMany of New York City\u2019s subway lines remained suspended into the evening on Thursday. Airports were open but hundreds of flights had been canceled.\nIn New York City, the dead ranged in age from a 2-year-old boy to an 86-year-old woman, the police said. Some drowned in basement apartments in Queens, where a system of makeshift and mostly illegally converted living spaces has sprung up.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Gov. Philip D.

Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.\nBefore you give, do your research.\nNatural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.\n</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.\nDonations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.\nIf you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.\nHere are some local organizations in the storm area.\nAll Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.\nThe Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.\nCulture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin\u2019 Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.\nAirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.\nSBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.\nA number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana\u2019s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.\nBayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.\nLouisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.\nNational organizations are lending a hand.\nAmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.\nMercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida\u2019s wake and is accepting donations.\nGoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.\nProject HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.\nThe Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 90999.</span>\nThe Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.\nUnited Way of Southeast Louisiana is collecting donations for a relief fund to rebuild and provide long-term assistance, including community grants."}, "28092": {"id": "28092", "text": "<h3>The Future of Our Library in Court</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 8,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2009 12</span>:01 am ET\n\nThe government's bank stress tests deserve a B-minus.\n\nTo give a sustained boost to investor confidence, the tests needed demonstrable rigor.

That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.\nIn the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC\u2019s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.\nKickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time \u2014 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif.

The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.\nIt\u2019s been <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.\nAcross the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.\nSoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.\nHere are where temperature records were broken in 2021:\nA common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja\u2019Marr Chase, has been that this year\u2019s Super Bowl is \u201cjust another game.\u201d\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,\u201d Burrow said after Friday\u2019s practice, the last of the season.\nTheir opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year\u2019s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.\nBut despite the Bengals\u2019 relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\nHe said that he and Duke Tobin, the team\u2019s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.\n\u201cThey certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments \u2014 they have proven that over the last two months,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we\u2019ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.\u201d\nNine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.\nWhen Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.\nMiller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\nBlocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals\u2019 offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.\nBurrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams\u2019 pass rush if the Bengals can\u2019t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ticket prices for this year\u2019s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.\nThe Bengals play in one of the league\u2019s smallest markets, but their fans haven\u2019t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).\nWhile the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.\nAll fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 24 hours</span>.

Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.\nLos Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor \u201cmega\u201d events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.\nAway from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,\u201d Sikka said. \u201cYou should test to go to your Super Bowl party.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Super Bowl 2022 Live Updates: The Rams and Bengals to Face Off</h3>Super <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Bowl 2022 Live</span> Updates: The Rams and Bengals to Face Off\nThe upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.\nThe final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.\nThe Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.\nIn the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC\u2019s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.\nKickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time \u2014 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there\u2019s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl\u2019s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.\nOutside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L\u2019\u00c9quipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).\nAfter the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year\u2019s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on.
