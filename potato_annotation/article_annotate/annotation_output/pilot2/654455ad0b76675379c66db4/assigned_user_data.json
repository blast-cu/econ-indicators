The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 73 percent</span> of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction.\nBut Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether \u2014 keeping the buildings open for emergency child care \u2014 rather than return to virtual instruction.\n\u201cNobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can\u2019t afford the luxury of staying home.\u201d\nMs. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage.\nAs highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away.\nLike other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute.</span> The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability.\nCoronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages \u2014 regardless of vaccination status \u2014 have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes.\nIn addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span> of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated.\n</span>Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning.\n\u201cWe are between a rock and a hard place \u2014 the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,\u201d Stacy Davis Gates, the union\u2019s vice president, said this week. She added, \u201cWe said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.\u201d\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||547,613||+254%|\n|New deaths||1,323||\u20133%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||1,771,851||+156%|\n|New deaths||6,153||\u201311%|\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism on Wednesday after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure to rein in the coronavirus pandemic ahead of a key presidential election.\n\u201cI really want to piss off the unvaccinated,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien. \u201cAnd so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.\u201d\nMr. Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France\u2019<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 67 million</span> people are fully vaccinated, but roughly five million French people have not received a single shot.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put them in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vaccinate them by force.\u201d\nInstead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France\u2019s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.\nOnce the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination \u2014 or, in some cases, of recovery from Covid-19 \u2014 will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.\nFrance has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 270,000 for</span> Tuesday alone \u2014 and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.\nMr. Macron has consistently made it clear that his government\u2019s strategy was to make life for unvaccinated French people uncomfortable. But his comments, which were published late Tuesday on the newspaper\u2019s website, marked the first time he stated so in such a crude way, even as the rapid surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is already fraying France\u2019s social contract on Covid.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments quickly caused an uproar in Parliament, interrupting a session where lawmakers were debating the government\u2019s vaccination bill. Reaction from his political opposition was swift.\nChristian Jacob, the head of the right-wing Republicans party, told lawmakers that the comments were unbecoming of a French head of state. \u201cI cannot support a bill whose only goal is to piss off the French,\u201d he said.\nMarine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron\u2019s main opponents in the upcoming election, accused him of \u201cwaging war\u201d on the unvaccinated.\n\u201cEven if one doesn\u2019t share their choice, they have broken none of our country\u2019s laws,\u201d she told reporters in Parliament late Tuesday, saying Mr. Macron had made a political and moral mistake. \u201cHe is continuing his policy of division, of pitting the French against one another,\u201d she added.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments come in a heated political climate \u2014 less than four months before the presidential election \u2014 and after he vowed in a recent interview that he had learned from mistakes made earlier in his term, when his one-liners were regularly criticized as dismissive and out of touch.\nThe president\u2019s opponents have maneuvered in Parliament to delay the passing of the vaccination bill, and his supporters have reported receiving death threats and insults because they are backing the legislation. One lawmaker\u2019s home garage was the target of arson and hostile graffiti last month.\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a member of the European Parliament and close ally of Mr. Macron\u2019s, defended the president\u2019s comments, arguing on Twitter that it was the unvaccinated who were bothering the French by overburdening hospitals, exhausting health workers and \u201cforcing the rest of the population to endure restrictions.\u201d\n\u201cSo yes, we have to piss them off in return,\u201d he said.\nThe news that Novak Djokovic had received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament this month in Melbourne spurred a range of reactions in Australia, where some politicians and tennis officials called on him to explain himself.\nDjokovic, the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 male</span> tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was \u201cheading Down Under with an exemption permission.\u201d\nThe tournament\u2019s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated.\nReaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, \u201cIf he\u2019s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very politically correct of you,\u201d de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, \u201cI just think it\u2019s just very interesting; that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\nOther Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated.\nStephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t care how good a tennis player he is. If he\u2019s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.\u201d\nAnother Twitter user called it \u201ca slap in the face of millions of Australians.\u201d\nJamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: \u201cI think if it was me that wasn\u2019t vaccinated, I wouldn\u2019t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\u201d\nDjokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine \u2014 he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water \u2014 and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic\u2019s father referred to the mandate as \u201cblackmail.\u201d\nJacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what\u2019s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,\u201d she said on Wednesday at a news conference.\nCraig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people \u201cwill be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,\u201d but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors.\nLeft unanswered was whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they \u201cwill need to provide proof\u201d to airline staff.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide \u201cacceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cIf that evidence is insufficient,\u201d Morrison said, \u201che won\u2019t be treated different to anyone else and he\u2019ll be on the next plane home.\u201d\nHong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to control an incipient Omicron outbreak.\nThe new measures will deepen the city\u2019s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions from the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of Omicron threatens to set off the city\u2019s fifth wave of the pandemic.\n\u201cGiven the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new rules.\nA day earlier, Mrs. Lam had said that no new social-distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city\u2019s first Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.\n\u201cWe have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are racing with Omicron, a highly transmissible variant.\u201d\nThe restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already has one of the world\u2019s longest quarantines \u2014 up to three weeks. Under the new rules, flights will be temporarily banned from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and United States for two weeks starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from traveling by other routes.\nLarge public events will be canceled, and several public venues \u2014 including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors \u2014 will be closed. Visits to hospitals and nursing homes will also be banned for two weeks. Dining in restaurants will be banned <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 6 p</span>.m. But the government decided not to stop in-person teaching or require government officials to work from home.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Hong Kong has had a growing number of imported cases of the Omicron variant, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 133 as</span> of Tuesday.\n</span>\u201cIf this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s director of health.\nThe Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec.<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> infecting his father and at least one other person.\nMrs. Lam said the measures were most likely \u201cthe most decisive, rapid, targeted and comprehensive for the past two years so that we can cut the transmission chains as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient.\nNine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan.<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 had</span> come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The people were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative.\nJohn Yoon contributed reporting.\nA woman in Georgia who fraudulently obtained more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 million</span> in Covid relief money was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $2.2 billion</span> Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span>In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $7.9 million</span> on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 49,</span> whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2016,</span> lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said.</span> Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight.\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2.1 million</span> of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $6 million</span> that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $1.6 million</span>.\nThe giant loan program, which ran intermittently from <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2020 to</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2021,</span> relied on banks and other lenders. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans.\n</span>The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $76 billion</span> of <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $800 billion</span> in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $38 billion</span>.)\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 defendants</span> so far and seized more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $75 million</span> in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items.\nLast month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J. Bellamy, was sentenced <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 37 months</span> in prison after he fraudulently obtained more <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.2 million</span> through the Paycheck Protection Program for a company that he owned.\nProsecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had spent more <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $100,000 of</span> the funds on luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other brands. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nThe World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread.\nThe B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.</span> Only <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 samples</span> have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December.\nAbdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency\u2019s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months.\n\u201cThat virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,\u201d he said.\nBy contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> has more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 120,000 sequences</span> in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 128 countries</span>, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world.\nConcerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained 46 mutations</span> that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible.\nAccording to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 12 cases</span> in the area and named the variant \u201cI.H.U.,\u201d after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it.\n\u201cIt is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">these 12 cases</span>,\u201d researchers wrote.\nNumerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant.\nTom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, \u201cthis virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.\u201d\nLots of chat about B.1.640.2 in the last few days - just a few points to keep in mind:\u2014 Tom Peacock (@PeacockFlu) <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 3,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022\n</span>- B.1.640.2 actually predates Omicron\n- in all that time there are exactly...<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 sequences</span> (compared to the >120k Omis in less time)\nDef not one worth worrying about too much at the mo...\nAfter going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that\u2019s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry\u2019s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 2,200 exhibitors</span> set to show up in person.\n</span>But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.\nIt\u2019s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES \u2014 like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon \u2014 have decided it\u2019s time to gather in person again.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Canceling the show would \u201churt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators\u201d who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</span> (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $291 million</span> from spending tied to it <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span>) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.\nBut many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave \u201cbig gaps on the show floor,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.\nOther big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month\u2019s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.\n</span>So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained.\n\u201cWe have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,\u201d Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, \u201cWe can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.\u201d\nThe prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.\n\u201cI do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting through the wave without further restrictions.\nAs Mr. Johnson\u2019s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 218,000 new</span> coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.\nAbsences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.\nMr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">identified 100,000 critical</span> workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.\nSchools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England\u2019s National Health Service moved to a \u201cwar footing,\u201d the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.\nDespite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.\nEngland\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 88 percent</span> protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.\nEarlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak \u201cmay possibly have plateaued.\u201d\nProfessor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed.

The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 73 percent</span> of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction.\nBut Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether \u2014 keeping the buildings open for emergency child care \u2014 rather than return to virtual instruction.\n\u201cNobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can\u2019t afford the luxury of staying home.\u201d\nMs. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage.\nAs highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away.\nLike other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute.</span> The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability.\nCoronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages \u2014 regardless of vaccination status \u2014 have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes.\nIn addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span> of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated.\n</span>Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning.\n\u201cWe are between a rock and a hard place \u2014 the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,\u201d Stacy Davis Gates, the union\u2019s vice president, said this week. She added, \u201cWe said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.\u201d\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||547,613||+254%|\n|New deaths||1,323||\u20133%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||1,771,851||+156%|\n|New deaths||6,153||\u201311%|\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism on Wednesday after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure to rein in the coronavirus pandemic ahead of a key presidential election.\n\u201cI really want to piss off the unvaccinated,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien. \u201cAnd so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.\u201d\nMr. Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France\u2019<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 67 million</span> people are fully vaccinated, but roughly five million French people have not received a single shot.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put them in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vaccinate them by force.\u201d\nInstead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France\u2019s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.\nOnce the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination \u2014 or, in some cases, of recovery from Covid-19 \u2014 will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.\nFrance has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 270,000 for</span> Tuesday alone \u2014 and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.\nMr. Macron has consistently made it clear that his government\u2019s strategy was to make life for unvaccinated French people uncomfortable. But his comments, which were published late Tuesday on the newspaper\u2019s website, marked the first time he stated so in such a crude way, even as the rapid surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is already fraying France\u2019s social contract on Covid.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments quickly caused an uproar in Parliament, interrupting a session where lawmakers were debating the government\u2019s vaccination bill. Reaction from his political opposition was swift.\nChristian Jacob, the head of the right-wing Republicans party, told lawmakers that the comments were unbecoming of a French head of state. \u201cI cannot support a bill whose only goal is to piss off the French,\u201d he said.\nMarine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron\u2019s main opponents in the upcoming election, accused him of \u201cwaging war\u201d on the unvaccinated.\n\u201cEven if one doesn\u2019t share their choice, they have broken none of our country\u2019s laws,\u201d she told reporters in Parliament late Tuesday, saying Mr. Macron had made a political and moral mistake. \u201cHe is continuing his policy of division, of pitting the French against one another,\u201d she added.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments come in a heated political climate \u2014 less than four months before the presidential election \u2014 and after he vowed in a recent interview that he had learned from mistakes made earlier in his term, when his one-liners were regularly criticized as dismissive and out of touch.\nThe president\u2019s opponents have maneuvered in Parliament to delay the passing of the vaccination bill, and his supporters have reported receiving death threats and insults because they are backing the legislation. One lawmaker\u2019s home garage was the target of arson and hostile graffiti last month.\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a member of the European Parliament and close ally of Mr. Macron\u2019s, defended the president\u2019s comments, arguing on Twitter that it was the unvaccinated who were bothering the French by overburdening hospitals, exhausting health workers and \u201cforcing the rest of the population to endure restrictions.\u201d\n\u201cSo yes, we have to piss them off in return,\u201d he said.\nThe news that Novak Djokovic had received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament this month in Melbourne spurred a range of reactions in Australia, where some politicians and tennis officials called on him to explain himself.\nDjokovic, the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 male</span> tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was \u201cheading Down Under with an exemption permission.\u201d\nThe tournament\u2019s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated.\nReaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, \u201cIf he\u2019s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very politically correct of you,\u201d de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, \u201cI just think it\u2019s just very interesting; that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\nOther Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated.\nStephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t care how good a tennis player he is. If he\u2019s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.\u201d\nAnother Twitter user called it \u201ca slap in the face of millions of Australians.\u201d\nJamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: \u201cI think if it was me that wasn\u2019t vaccinated, I wouldn\u2019t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\u201d\nDjokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine \u2014 he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water \u2014 and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic\u2019s father referred to the mandate as \u201cblackmail.\u201d\nJacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what\u2019s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,\u201d she said on Wednesday at a news conference.\nCraig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people \u201cwill be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,\u201d but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors.\nLeft unanswered was whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they \u201cwill need to provide proof\u201d to airline staff.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide \u201cacceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cIf that evidence is insufficient,\u201d Morrison said, \u201che won\u2019t be treated different to anyone else and he\u2019ll be on the next plane home.\u201d\nHong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to control an incipient Omicron outbreak.\nThe new measures will deepen the city\u2019s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions from the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of Omicron threatens to set off the city\u2019s fifth wave of the pandemic.\n\u201cGiven the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new rules.\nA day earlier, Mrs. Lam had said that no new social-distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city\u2019s first Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.\n\u201cWe have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are racing with Omicron, a highly transmissible variant.\u201d\nThe restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already has one of the world\u2019s longest quarantines \u2014 up to three weeks. Under the new rules, flights will be temporarily banned from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and United States for two weeks starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from traveling by other routes.\nLarge public events will be canceled, and several public venues \u2014 including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors \u2014 will be closed. Visits to hospitals and nursing homes will also be banned for two weeks. Dining in restaurants will be banned <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 6 p</span>.m. But the government decided not to stop in-person teaching or require government officials to work from home.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Hong Kong has had a growing number of imported cases of the Omicron variant, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 133 as</span> of Tuesday.\n</span>\u201cIf this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s director of health.\nThe Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec.<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> infecting his father and at least one other person.\nMrs. Lam said the measures were most likely \u201cthe most decisive, rapid, targeted and comprehensive for the past two years so that we can cut the transmission chains as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient.\nNine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan.<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 had</span> come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The people were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative.\nJohn Yoon contributed reporting.\nA woman in Georgia who fraudulently obtained more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 million</span> in Covid relief money was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $2.2 billion</span> Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span>In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $7.9 million</span> on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 49,</span> whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2016,</span> lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said.</span> Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight.\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2.1 million</span> of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $6 million</span> that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $1.6 million</span>.\nThe giant loan program, which ran intermittently from <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2020 to</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2021,</span> relied on banks and other lenders. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans.\n</span>The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $76 billion</span> of <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $800 billion</span> in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $38 billion</span>.)\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 defendants</span> so far and seized more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $75 million</span> in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items.\nLast month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J.

He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nThe World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread.\nThe B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.</span> Only <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 samples</span> have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December.\nAbdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency\u2019s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months.\n\u201cThat virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,\u201d he said.\nBy contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> has more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 120,000 sequences</span> in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 128 countries</span>, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world.\nConcerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained 46 mutations</span> that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible.\nAccording to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 12 cases</span> in the area and named the variant \u201cI.H.U.,\u201d after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it.\n\u201cIt is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">these 12 cases</span>,\u201d researchers wrote.\nNumerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant.\nTom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, \u201cthis virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.\u201d\nLots of chat about B.1.640.2 in the last few days - just a few points to keep in mind:\u2014 Tom Peacock (@PeacockFlu) <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 3,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022\n</span>- B.1.640.2 actually predates Omicron\n- in all that time there are exactly...<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 sequences</span> (compared to the >120k Omis in less time)\nDef not one worth worrying about too much at the mo...\nAfter going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that\u2019s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry\u2019s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 2,200 exhibitors</span> set to show up in person.\n</span>But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.\nIt\u2019s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES \u2014 like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon \u2014 have decided it\u2019s time to gather in person again.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Canceling the show would \u201churt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators\u201d who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</span> (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $291 million</span> from spending tied to it <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span>) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.\nBut many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave \u201cbig gaps on the show floor,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.\nOther big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month\u2019s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.\n</span>So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained.\n\u201cWe have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,\u201d Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, \u201cWe can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.\u201d\nThe prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.\n\u201cI do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting through the wave without further restrictions.\nAs Mr. Johnson\u2019s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 218,000 new</span> coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.\nAbsences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.\nMr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">identified 100,000 critical</span> workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.\nSchools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England\u2019s National Health Service moved to a \u201cwar footing,\u201d the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.\nDespite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.\nEngland\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 88 percent</span> protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.\nEarlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak \u201cmay possibly have plateaued.\u201d\nProfessor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said.\n\u201cHospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,\u201d Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year.\nThe International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 11 workers</span> at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals.\nAll of the infected workers \u2014 eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec.<span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23 flight</span> \u2014 were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country\u2019s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.)\nThe outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica;<span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 36 people</span> stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2020.</span> But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations.\nThere are <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">now 30 people</span> stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 2,600 miles</span> south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting \u201cremote field work,\u201d according to the foundation.\nSome news outlets have reported <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 16 people</span> tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had \u201csuspended\u201d flights to and from the station until Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span></span> saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec.<span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23 and</span> Jan.<span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 in</span> the first place.\n\u201cThe management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span></span>\u201d the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. \u201cHowever, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan.<span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 as</span> planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.\u201d\nWorkers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 72 hours</span> of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 48 hours</span> of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station.\nAccording to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec.<span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9,</span> and all members tested negative on Dec.<span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 14.</span>\nThe first infection was detected on Dec.<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15.</span> The foundation said medical staff had \u201cisolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others\u201d \u2014 leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk.

Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\nGoogle and\nFacebook Inc.\nOr it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t head-to-head competitors. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They want to combine AT&T\u2019s video-distribution network with Time Warner\u2019s content\u2014from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the NCAA basketball tournament\u2014in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.\n</span>\u201cThis will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,\u201d said Wayne State University law professor\nStephen Calkins,\n\u201cand what the court says will be terribly important.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump with AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephenson during a White House event last year.\nPhoto:\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\nThe case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss\nRandall Stephenson\nand U.S. antitrust chief\nMakan Delrahim.\nMr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.\nMr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal\u2014the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc.,\nHulu and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube.

Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.\u2019s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with\nWalt Disney Co.\ninstead.

buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s team says yes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and \u201cAmerican consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.\u201d\n</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner\u2019s content, especially the Turner networks\u2014including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV\u2014are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner\u2019s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.\nA season premiere of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 shows at a Moscow metro station last year.\nPhoto:\nVASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn\u2019t be so willing under AT&T. \u201cWith the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,\u201d it says in filings.\nAT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.\nMr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim\u2019s motives and cited a television interview <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn\u2019t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\nThe two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger\u2019s fate.\nThe Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.\nAT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO\nJeff Bewkes,\nabout what they see as the deal\u2019s benefits.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor\nCarl Shapiro,\nwho served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>.\n</span>Judge Leon, a George W.

After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn\u2019t comment on the litigation, then added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.\u201d\nAn AT&T store in Newport Beach, Calif.\nPhoto:\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg NEWS\nThere is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump\u2019s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.\nMr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn\u2019t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $4 billion</span>.\n</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the deal.\nThe Justice Department has been riding a decade\u2019s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.", "displayed_text": "<h3>How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business\n</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government\u2019s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, left, is facing off with U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, right.\nPhoto:\nBloomberg News; Associated Press\nWASHINGTON\u2014The government accuses the company\u2019s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film \u201cCasablanca.\u201d The company likens the government\u2019s case to a shaved Persian cat, \u201cpale and thin.\u201d\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.\nIt could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\nGoogle and\nFacebook Inc.\nOr it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t head-to-head competitors. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They want to combine AT&T\u2019s video-distribution network with Time Warner\u2019s content\u2014from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the NCAA basketball tournament\u2014in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.\n</span>\u201cThis will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,\u201d said Wayne State University law professor\nStephen Calkins,\n\u201cand what the court says will be terribly important.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump with AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephenson during a White House event last year.\nPhoto:\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\nThe case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss\nRandall Stephenson\nand U.S. antitrust chief\nMakan Delrahim.\nMr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.\nMr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal\u2014the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc.,\nHulu and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube.

Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.\u2019s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with\nWalt Disney Co.\ninstead.

But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.\nMr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim\u2019s motives and cited a television interview <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn\u2019t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\nThe two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger\u2019s fate.\nThe Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.\nAT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO\nJeff Bewkes,\nabout what they see as the deal\u2019s benefits.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor\nCarl Shapiro,\nwho served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>.\n</span>Judge Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, is expected to rule in the next few months.

After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn\u2019t comment on the litigation, then added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.\u201d\nAn AT&T store in Newport Beach, Calif.\nPhoto:\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg NEWS\nThere is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump\u2019s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.\nMr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn\u2019t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $4 billion</span>.\n</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the deal.\nThe Justice Department has been riding a decade\u2019s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon."}, "74250": {"id": "74250", "text": "<h3>Euro Hits Five-Month High on French Election Results</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Currency rises to <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $1.09 against</span> the U.S. dollar; polls give Macron significant lead over Le Pen in second round\n\nUpdated <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 24,</span></span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017 3</span>:11 am ET\n\nThe euro, French government bonds and European stocks jumped sharply in the wake of the first round of France\u2019s presidential election, with centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron edging out far-right politician Marine Le Pen\n\nEurope\u2019s common currency rose as much <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 1.9% to</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1.0935,</span> its highest level against the dollar since November.</span> Against the Japanese yen, the euro surged as <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">high 120.82,</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 3.3%.</span> Gains moderated in recent action, with the euro <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 1.2% against</span> the dollar <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 2.1% against</span> the yen.\n\nTraders drove down the spread between French and German government bonds, which had widened during the presidential campaign. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The 10-year French bond <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">yielded 0.76% in</span> early trading Monday, a spread <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.42 percentage</span> point above benchmark German debt.</span> The spread <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 0.64 percentage</span> point on Friday.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, the French CAC-40 stock market index <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surged 3.8% in</span> the early minutes of European trade, driving the broader</span> Stoxx <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Europe 600 up</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.5%.</span> Across Europe, gains in equities were led by banks, which <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 3.5%,</span> a sign that investors are again eager to bet on risk.\n\nMany euro traders\u2014and holders of European assets\u2014had been concerned by the prospect of a strong showing by Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, or by the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Ms. Le Pen wants France out of the currency union, and Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has advocated scrapping some of its core fiscal rules.</span> Both positions, especially Ms. Le Pen\u2019s, would spell trouble for the euro and for French government bonds.\n\nMr. Macron won the first round <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 23.9% of</span> the vote, followed by Ms. Le Pen <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 21.4%,</span> according to an official tally <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 96% of</span> the votes, meaning the pair will head into the second round on <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 7.</span> Opinion polls published Sunday suggested Mr. Macron would beat Ms. Le Pen.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is the most market-friendly outcome,\u201d said Vincent Juvyns, a strategist at J.P.

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

She was out before the cameras for just under an hour. No big fireworks, no political trouble from her answers but plenty of room for her colleagues to battle out this divide in public for the next three months. Good luck to all of us.\nToday's final question is on the issue of worker paychecks.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Already, Ms. Yellen said, there\u2019s been \u201csome modest pickup in wage growth,\u201d and last week\u2019s Census Bureau report on U.S. household income was \u201cencouraging.\u201d</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Going forward, she said, as the labor market continues to improve, there should be further acceleration in wages.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Milton Friedman once said monetary policy operates with long and variable lags.</span> Has that changed?\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The short answer: No. Ms. Yellen says the Fed still needs to operate based on forecasts.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">She does not support the notion that officials should take a whites-of-their-eyes approach to inflation (i.e., waiting until it's clearly in front of you).\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But the global economy's structure changes and the nature of inflation changes.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">So times change, she says, but the forward-looking nature of monetary policy still matters.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Should private bankers continue to sit on the boards of the regional Fed banks?</span> Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called getting rid of that arrangement a no-brainer.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen said that \u201cvery strong measures\u201d are in place to prevent conflicts of interest when it comes to the Fed's bank-supervision activities.\n</span>In the end, she said, \u201cit\u2019s up to Congress to decide what to do here.\u201d But she added a cautionary note that lawmakers should carefully think through the ramifications of any changes.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">How on earth will the Fed raise rates by two and a half percentage points with growth so low and not generating much inflation?\n</span>The answer isn't all that pleasant. \"I agree the projections for growth are slow,\" Ms. Yellen says.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The Fed has written down its estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate and the longer-run normal level of interest rates.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Part of the reason: Productivity growth is low and will stay low.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But but but (yes, there's a but) Ms. Yellen says inflation\u2014wage and price growth\u2014is driven by tightness in the labor market.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">We are still getting a healthy pace of job-market growth with very slow economic growth.\n</span>That explains the downward shift in the neutral federal-funds rate. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">In the end, the concern is about slow productivity growth because it means slow growth in living standards.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">When banks harm consumers, it's not just a consumer-protection issue.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">\"One of the lessons from the financial crisis is that abuses of consumers that we saw in subprime lending ultimately did become safety and soundness issues,\" Ms. Yellen said.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Left unsaid, of course: not only did these abuses of last decade help cripple the banks, they brought down the broader economy too.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 just</span> hit a new high for the day, as traders hash out what all this means for equities.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Stocks initially shot higher right after the news hit that the Fed was standing pat, but by the time Ms. Yellen stepped to the microphone, they had fallen back to almost exactly where the had started.</span> As she's been speaking, they've climbed again, and now sit <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.9% at</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2158,</span> a fresh high for Wednesday's session.\n\u2014Erik Holm\nMs. Yellen got a couple of chances to comment on the banking scandal de jour, at Wells Fargo & Co.\nMs. Yellen noted the leading role of other regulatory agencies, but she said that \u201cthis has been and will be a focus of our supervision\u201d of Wells Fargo.\nMs. Yellen was asked whether banks can be too big and complex to manage. The context for the question was Wells Fargo, where wide-scale problems were allowed to fester. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Was the bank just too big?\nMs. Yellen responded that the Fed has \"high expectations for what we expect to be in place in a large organization\" -- such as strong risk management, auditing and a competent board of directors that holds senior management accountable.\n</span>\"I don't think these are impossible standards to meet,\" she said. \"I wouldn't arrive at the conclusion that just because an organization is large they can't live up to those standards.<span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">\"\nTreasurys' yield curve is flattening after the Fed pronouncements, with the underperformance of short-dated notes reflecting the likelihood that a rate hike this year remains solidly on the table.\n</span>The curve has been jumpy of late\u2014flattening most <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2016 before</span> steepening amid the bond selloff of the past two weeks amid concerns about the Bank of Japan possibly shifting focus to engineer a steeper curve.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">But the U.S. curve is flattening again this week, and some believe the Fed's tightening bias\u2014even on a very slow path\u2014makes it hard for yields to steepen much unless inflation flares up.</span> The 10-year note's yield premium relative to 2s is <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 88 basis</span> points, near the least since 2007; it <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 91 basis</span> points yesterday.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u2014 Min Zeng\nIt's a good question about tariffs and their economic impact.</span> But Ms. Yellen wants none of it.\nThat's a political issue current being debated, she says. \"I'm going to pass on that one.<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">\"\nMs. Yellen previously said that the Fed was closely watching asset markets, especially the commercial real estate market, for signs of overheating.</span> Asked specifically in a follow up whether the concern was a bubble, Ms. Yellen said it was.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">She reiterated the steps the Fed has taken to improve its approach to financial stability in recent years and added that, on the regulatory front, she believes the Fed has taken constructive steps that make the financial system safer today than it was a decade ago.\n</span>\"The soundness and state of the banking system has improved substantially,\" she said.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Asked again about charges that the Fed is politically compromised, Ms. Yellen has news for you: \"The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised.</span>\"\nSo there. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The Fed does not discuss politics in its meetings, she says.</span> \"I can't recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion.\" <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">If the public were watching on TV they would have seen \"a rich, deep, serious intellectual debate about the risks in the forecasts for the economy.</span>\"\n\"We struggled mightily with trying to understand one another's points of view, and to come out at a balanced place and to act responsibly,\" she says. \"And that's my commitment to the American people, that I want to lead an institution that is not political....<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">We are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has assigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment.</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">\"\nIn case she left any doubt, a followup question offers this answer from her: \"I have no concern that the Fed is politically motivated.</span> And I will assure you that you will not find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are released in five years.<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">\"\nMs. Yellen really doesn\u2019t want to talk about the presidential election and whether it poses a risk to the U.S. economy.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into politics,\u201d she said when asked why the Fed seems less concerned about the upcoming U.S. vote than it did about this summer\u2019s Brexit vote in the U.K.\nOne theory for some of the economy's weakness this year is that businesses, in particular, are reluctant to invest because they're uncertain about what U.S. economic policy will look like after the election.\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen agreed that business investment has been inexplicably weak.</span> She said that \"investment spending really has been quite weak for some time and we're really not certain what is causing that.

She was out before the cameras for just under an hour. No big fireworks, no political trouble from her answers but plenty of room for her colleagues to battle out this divide in public for the next three months. Good luck to all of us.\nToday's final question is on the issue of worker paychecks.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Already, Ms. Yellen said, there\u2019s been \u201csome modest pickup in wage growth,\u201d and last week\u2019s Census Bureau report on U.S. household income was \u201cencouraging.\u201d</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Going forward, she said, as the labor market continues to improve, there should be further acceleration in wages.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Milton Friedman once said monetary policy operates with long and variable lags.</span> Has that changed?\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The short answer: No. Ms. Yellen says the Fed still needs to operate based on forecasts.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">She does not support the notion that officials should take a whites-of-their-eyes approach to inflation (i.e., waiting until it's clearly in front of you).\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But the global economy's structure changes and the nature of inflation changes.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">So times change, she says, but the forward-looking nature of monetary policy still matters.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Should private bankers continue to sit on the boards of the regional Fed banks?</span> Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called getting rid of that arrangement a no-brainer.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen said that \u201cvery strong measures\u201d are in place to prevent conflicts of interest when it comes to the Fed's bank-supervision activities.\n</span>In the end, she said, \u201cit\u2019s up to Congress to decide what to do here.\u201d But she added a cautionary note that lawmakers should carefully think through the ramifications of any changes.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">How on earth will the Fed raise rates by two and a half percentage points with growth so low and not generating much inflation?\n</span>The answer isn't all that pleasant. \"I agree the projections for growth are slow,\" Ms. Yellen says.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The Fed has written down its estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate and the longer-run normal level of interest rates.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Part of the reason: Productivity growth is low and will stay low.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But but but (yes, there's a but) Ms. Yellen says inflation\u2014wage and price growth\u2014is driven by tightness in the labor market.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">We are still getting a healthy pace of job-market growth with very slow economic growth.\n</span>That explains the downward shift in the neutral federal-funds rate. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">In the end, the concern is about slow productivity growth because it means slow growth in living standards.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">When banks harm consumers, it's not just a consumer-protection issue.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">\"One of the lessons from the financial crisis is that abuses of consumers that we saw in subprime lending ultimately did become safety and soundness issues,\" Ms. Yellen said.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Left unsaid, of course: not only did these abuses of last decade help cripple the banks, they brought down the broader economy too.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 just</span> hit a new high for the day, as traders hash out what all this means for equities.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Stocks initially shot higher right after the news hit that the Fed was standing pat, but by the time Ms. Yellen stepped to the microphone, they had fallen back to almost exactly where the had started.</span> As she's been speaking, they've climbed again, and now sit <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.9% at</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2158,</span> a fresh high for Wednesday's session.\n\u2014Erik Holm\nMs. Yellen got a couple of chances to comment on the banking scandal de jour, at Wells Fargo & Co.\nMs. Yellen noted the leading role of other regulatory agencies, but she said that \u201cthis has been and will be a focus of our supervision\u201d of Wells Fargo.\nMs. Yellen was asked whether banks can be too big and complex to manage. The context for the question was Wells Fargo, where wide-scale problems were allowed to fester. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Was the bank just too big?\nMs. Yellen responded that the Fed has \"high expectations for what we expect to be in place in a large organization\" -- such as strong risk management, auditing and a competent board of directors that holds senior management accountable.\n</span>\"I don't think these are impossible standards to meet,\" she said. \"I wouldn't arrive at the conclusion that just because an organization is large they can't live up to those standards.<span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">\"\nTreasurys' yield curve is flattening after the Fed pronouncements, with the underperformance of short-dated notes reflecting the likelihood that a rate hike this year remains solidly on the table.\n</span>The curve has been jumpy of late\u2014flattening most <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2016 before</span> steepening amid the bond selloff of the past two weeks amid concerns about the Bank of Japan possibly shifting focus to engineer a steeper curve.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">But the U.S. curve is flattening again this week, and some believe the Fed's tightening bias\u2014even on a very slow path\u2014makes it hard for yields to steepen much unless inflation flares up.</span> The 10-year note's yield premium relative to 2s is <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 88 basis</span> points, near the least since 2007; it <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 91 basis</span> points yesterday.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u2014 Min Zeng\nIt's a good question about tariffs and their economic impact.</span> But Ms. Yellen wants none of it.\nThat's a political issue current being debated, she says. \"I'm going to pass on that one.<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">\"\nMs. Yellen previously said that the Fed was closely watching asset markets, especially the commercial real estate market, for signs of overheating.</span> Asked specifically in a follow up whether the concern was a bubble, Ms. Yellen said it was.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">She reiterated the steps the Fed has taken to improve its approach to financial stability in recent years and added that, on the regulatory front, she believes the Fed has taken constructive steps that make the financial system safer today than it was a decade ago.\n</span>\"The soundness and state of the banking system has improved substantially,\" she said.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Asked again about charges that the Fed is politically compromised, Ms. Yellen has news for you: \"The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised.</span>\"\nSo there. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The Fed does not discuss politics in its meetings, she says.</span> \"I can't recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion.\" <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">If the public were watching on TV they would have seen \"a rich, deep, serious intellectual debate about the risks in the forecasts for the economy.</span>\"\n\"We struggled mightily with trying to understand one another's points of view, and to come out at a balanced place and to act responsibly,\" she says. \"And that's my commitment to the American people, that I want to lead an institution that is not political....<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">We are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has assigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment.</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">\"\nIn case she left any doubt, a followup question offers this answer from her: \"I have no concern that the Fed is politically motivated.</span> And I will assure you that you will not find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are released in five years.<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">\"\nMs. Yellen really doesn\u2019t want to talk about the presidential election and whether it poses a risk to the U.S. economy.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into politics,\u201d she said when asked why the Fed seems less concerned about the upcoming U.S. vote than it did about this summer\u2019s Brexit vote in the U.K.\nOne theory for some of the economy's weakness this year is that businesses, in particular, are reluctant to invest because they're uncertain about what U.S. economic policy will look like after the election.\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen agreed that business investment has been inexplicably weak.</span> She said that \"investment spending really has been quite weak for some time and we're really not certain what is causing that.

But the holiday catalog, which has included a handful of outrageous items since 1959\u2014when Neiman put a Black Angus steer with a rolling roast-beef cart in its catalog\u2014has long been the last word in luxury, a potent symbol of shoppers' aspirations.\n\nNeiman Marcus is not the only store downplaying dreams. This year, Saks Inc.'s Saks Fifth Avenue is discontinuing its practice of marketing \"dreams by design\" or \"wow\" fantasy gift experiences such as a walk-on role in an American Ballet Theatre production sold in an online auction, with bids that started <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $3,000.</span>\n\nThe cuts reflect prolonged frugality among upscale shoppers. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year have fallen by double-digit percentages <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 straight</span> months.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">U.S. sales of luxury goods are expected to <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drop 15% this</span> year, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The dour economic climate has also bred distaste for conspicuous consumption.</span> Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus who is also its corporate gift scout, denies that the absence of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1 million</span>-plus gift is meant to make a statement. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">This year, \"I didn't see anything that I thought was fabulous\" in that price range, she says.</span> But Ms. Reeder examined the cultural mindset as part of her gift-creating process, and the themes she found, such as compassion for the earth, don't seem to square with million-dollar merchandise.\n\nNow awaiting buyers: the \"world's fastest\" electric motorcycle, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $73,000</span>; artwork of insect lab specimens with antique watch parts, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8,500</span>; and five-foot-long, \"sustainable\" chandeliers made from cut and sanded plastic soda bottles rescued from the landfill, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $12,000.</span> Overall, close <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50% of</span> the merchandise in this year's Neiman catalog costs less <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $250,</span> compared with <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30% to</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40% in</span> the past five years.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Before luxury-goods sales came to a halt last fall, retailers viewed fantasy gifts as powerful marketing tools.</span> The idea was that even those who couldn't afford to buy the over-the-top items would want to buy something from a brand with such cachet. Neiman Marcus usually sold less than half of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 or</span> so items on its fantasy-gift list\u2014and sometimes only the limited-edition cars.\n\nBut the publicity given to, say, <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $20 million</span> submarine (2000) had its own value. <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> Neiman Marcus, which is owned by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, estimated that it would have had to spend at <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $9 million</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> on advertising to get the television exposure it received from that year's gift list, which included <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.76 million</span> spaceship ride.\n\nBy the time the number of high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. peaked <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> retailers were scrambling to outdo one another in their catalogs and on their Web sites. There were \"limited-production,\" \"one-of-a-kind\" and \"once-in-a-lifetime\" luxury offerings from companies like Victoria's Secret, which touted jewel-encrusted bras for the holidays. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2008 bra</span>, featuring black diamonds and rubies, was priced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $5 million</span>.</span> (None of the fantasy bras offered by Victoria's Secret each holiday <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1996 has</span> ever sold, though a 42-carat Harry Winston diamond on <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2004 bra</span> found a buyer.)\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">A spokesman for Saks says the holiday catalog will continue to carry high-end jewelry and other designer items this year, in addition to lower-priced items.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">A representative of Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc. said the price and carat weight of <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 2009 fantasy</span> bra will be announced later this month.\n\n</span>Now, luxury retailers are facing a significant decline in Americans' net worth. The World Wealth Report, published in late June by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini Consulting, estimates that the wealth of America's high-net-worth individuals (those who hold at <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $1 million</span> in investible assets) plunged by more <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 22% in</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2008.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">While consumer confidence has climbed slightly, and some shoppers are willing to spend a little more this season, most are restricting themselves to practical purchases and forgoing designer clothing and accessories that may go out of fashion quickly.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The National Retail Federation said Tuesday that it expects U.S. retail sales to fall <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2005 levels</span> in the coming holiday season, though the expected decline <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% isn</span>'t as deep as <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 3.4% plunge</span> of <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 holiday</span> season.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Some industry observers, such as Monica Aggarwal, a Fitch Ratings analyst, expect the sales declines at luxury retailers to continue until <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2010 or</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2011.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Still, the size of the expected decline in luxury-goods sales this holiday season is an improvement over last year's miserable results.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Sales of luxury merchandise are set to fall <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2% in</span> November and December, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In last year's holiday period, it estimates, such sales fell <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 14%.</span>\n\n</span>And Neiman still has quirky dreams on offer.

But the holiday catalog, which has included a handful of outrageous items since 1959\u2014when Neiman put a Black Angus steer with a rolling roast-beef cart in its catalog\u2014has long been the last word in luxury, a potent symbol of shoppers' aspirations.\n\nNeiman Marcus is not the only store downplaying dreams. This year, Saks Inc.'s Saks Fifth Avenue is discontinuing its practice of marketing \"dreams by design\" or \"wow\" fantasy gift experiences such as a walk-on role in an American Ballet Theatre production sold in an online auction, with bids that started <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $3,000.</span>\n\nThe cuts reflect prolonged frugality among upscale shoppers. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year have fallen by double-digit percentages <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 straight</span> months.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">U.S. sales of luxury goods are expected to <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drop 15% this</span> year, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The dour economic climate has also bred distaste for conspicuous consumption.</span> Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus who is also its corporate gift scout, denies that the absence of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1 million</span>-plus gift is meant to make a statement. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">This year, \"I didn't see anything that I thought was fabulous\" in that price range, she says.</span> But Ms. Reeder examined the cultural mindset as part of her gift-creating process, and the themes she found, such as compassion for the earth, don't seem to square with million-dollar merchandise.\n\nNow awaiting buyers: the \"world's fastest\" electric motorcycle, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $73,000</span>; artwork of insect lab specimens with antique watch parts, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8,500</span>; and five-foot-long, \"sustainable\" chandeliers made from cut and sanded plastic soda bottles rescued from the landfill, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $12,000.</span> Overall, close <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50% of</span> the merchandise in this year's Neiman catalog costs less <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $250,</span> compared with <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30% to</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40% in</span> the past five years.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Before luxury-goods sales came to a halt last fall, retailers viewed fantasy gifts as powerful marketing tools.</span> The idea was that even those who couldn't afford to buy the over-the-top items would want to buy something from a brand with such cachet. Neiman Marcus usually sold less than half of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 or</span> so items on its fantasy-gift list\u2014and sometimes only the limited-edition cars.\n\nBut the publicity given to, say, <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $20 million</span> submarine (2000) had its own value. <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> Neiman Marcus, which is owned by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, estimated that it would have had to spend at <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $9 million</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> on advertising to get the television exposure it received from that year's gift list, which included <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.76 million</span> spaceship ride.\n\nBy the time the number of high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. peaked <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> retailers were scrambling to outdo one another in their catalogs and on their Web sites. There were \"limited-production,\" \"one-of-a-kind\" and \"once-in-a-lifetime\" luxury offerings from companies like Victoria's Secret, which touted jewel-encrusted bras for the holidays. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2008 bra</span>, featuring black diamonds and rubies, was priced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $5 million</span>.</span> (None of the fantasy bras offered by Victoria's Secret each holiday <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1996 has</span> ever sold, though a 42-carat Harry Winston diamond on <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2004 bra</span> found a buyer.)\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">A spokesman for Saks says the holiday catalog will continue to carry high-end jewelry and other designer items this year, in addition to lower-priced items.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">A representative of Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc. said the price and carat weight of <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 2009 fantasy</span> bra will be announced later this month.\n\n</span>Now, luxury retailers are facing a significant decline in Americans' net worth. The World Wealth Report, published in late June by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini Consulting, estimates that the wealth of America's high-net-worth individuals (those who hold at <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $1 million</span> in investible assets) plunged by more <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 22% in</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2008.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">While consumer confidence has climbed slightly, and some shoppers are willing to spend a little more this season, most are restricting themselves to practical purchases and forgoing designer clothing and accessories that may go out of fashion quickly.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The National Retail Federation said Tuesday that it expects U.S. retail sales to fall <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2005 levels</span> in the coming holiday season, though the expected decline <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% isn</span>'t as deep as <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 3.4% plunge</span> of <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 holiday</span> season.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Some industry observers, such as Monica Aggarwal, a Fitch Ratings analyst, expect the sales declines at luxury retailers to continue until <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2010 or</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2011.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Still, the size of the expected decline in luxury-goods sales this holiday season is an improvement over last year's miserable results.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Sales of luxury merchandise are set to fall <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2% in</span> November and December, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In last year's holiday period, it estimates, such sales fell <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 14%.</span>\n\n</span>And Neiman still has quirky dreams on offer. Two of the nine fantasy gifts this year are alcohol-related \"experiences.\" There's <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $20,000 wine</span> and art visit to the Napa Valley vineyard owned by Kathryn and Craig Hall, and <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $7,500 trip</span> to the distillery for Maker's Mark bourbon in Louisville, Ky., with two bottles included.\n\nThen there's <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $25,000 electric</span> car in the shape of a cupcake. \"You sit in it and pull the top of the cupcake down over you,\" explains Ms. Reeder, who lost her assistant gift scout in a wave of layoffs that took place at Neiman Marcus earlier this year. \"This isn't street-legal,\" she adds. \"It's for someone who wants to impress the neighborhood at the Fourth of July parade.\" The cupcake, she confesses, \"was a last-minute addition because I thought we needed some whimsy.<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nAt any price level, the Neiman Marcus holiday catalog attracts customers' attention.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Robin Hopkins, of Alexandria, Ala., says, \"I'd still like to see\" the over-the-top gifts, even in the economic downturn.</span> She sometimes purchases smaller items from the holiday catalog, she says.

Even though it appears the Trump administration isn\u2019t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past \u2013 like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around \u2013 email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up.<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n3.</span> Maybe brokers are kicking butt.\nBefore the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they\u2019d helped enroll an <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 40 to</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50 percent</span> of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 43 percent</span> of new enrollments on the state\u2019s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment.\nThe Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration\u2019s refusal to promote the law.\nEHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span>, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage.\n\u201cWeb-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO Scott Flanders told me. \u201cSo it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.\u201d<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n4.</span> Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it.\nIf the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won\u2019t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that\u2019s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn\u2019t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said.\n\u201cOutreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,\u201d Peck said.\n|You are reading The <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Health 202,</span></span> our must-read newsletter on health policy.|\n|Not a regular subscriber?|\n| |\nAHH: There\u2019s an expensive big fight brewing between two powerful lobbies -- hospitals and drug makers -- around an obscure drug discount program called 340B, Politico's David Pittman reports. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The program is supposed to help rural and charity hospitals by offsetting the cost of medicines for these low-income providers with discounted drugs.</span> But 340B has grown exponentially, now <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">comprising $16 billion</span> worth of medications dispensed in hospitals every year.\n\"Drug companies have gone on offense,\" David writes. \"In paid advertising, messaging through an army of lobbyists and on-the-record briefing of reporters, the pharmaceutical industry has crafted a message that hospitals are taking <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $6 billion</span> in drug discounts and using it to enrich themselves rather than help poor patients. They say the 340B cash has even played a role in hospitals buying up doctors\u2019 offices, causing a rise in health care costs that more than cancels out any benefit of the drug discounts.\"\n\u201cIt seems to be a perversion of this program that patients might be paying more today than they would have prior,\u201d Lori Reilly, PhRMA executive vice president, told reporters recently. \u201cThe goal of 340B was to lower costs to patients, not increase them.\u201d\n\"Hospitals deny that characterization,\" David continues. \"But it\u2019s caught the attention of at least some on the Hill. Congressional offices are drafting bills that would more tightly limit how hospitals use the discounts...The lobbying has escalated fast. <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Nearly 160 organizations</span>, almost all drug companies, hospitals and community health centers, reported lobbying on 340B last quarter, spending a <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined $41.8 million</span>, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms.\"\nOOF: A provision in the annual defense authorization bill has sparked a fiery debate over whether the Pentagon should be allowed to authorize the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices for combat soldiers, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\nUnder existing law, the FDA is the only agency that can authorize the use of medical products -- but the Defense Department can request that the FDA grant approval if there's a threat of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent on the battlefield. The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order \u201cto reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.\u201d\nThe two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.\nOUCH: \"God only knows\" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is \u201cexploiting\u201d human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a \u201csocial-validation feedback loop,\u201d Parker said, adding that it is \u201cexactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.\u201d\nParker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself \"something of a conscientious objector,\" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. \u201cI don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,\u201d Parker said.\n</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month.

That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.\nLate last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.\n--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare.

But the initial trajectory is one that virtually no one predicted.\nLet\u2019s explore a few reasons why this might be:<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n1.</span> More Americans can get more generous subsidies this year.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">This is a phenomenon stemming from Trump\u2019s decision to cut off extra payments to insurers for cost-sharing reductions they must offer.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">We elaborated on this effect in Monday\u2019s The <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Health 202,</span></span> but here\u2019s the quick-and-dirty explanation: To make up for losing the payments, many insurers hiked prices for their mid-grade \u201csilver plans.\u201d</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">And because premium subsidies are based on silver plan prices, the subsidies are going up too, making bronze and gold plans even cheaper for many low-income people.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cI really believe the availability of these very low-cost plans could be a game changer,\u201d said Josh Peck, who served as Healthcare.gov\u2019s chief marketing officer under Obama and now heads up the group Get America Covered.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Enrollees eligible for subsidies will <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">get $555 on</span> average to offset the cost of their plans, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 45 percent</span> from this year\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $382 average</span> tax credit, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n</span>Point 2: It would be even <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">better 4 ppl</span> of all incomes & geos if Trump hadn't created uncertainty, repressed competition/enrollment, etc. 7/\u2014 Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 9,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017\n</span>2</span>. People with a Healthcare.gov account are still getting reminder emails.\nI know this because I created an account several years ago.

Even though it appears the Trump administration isn\u2019t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past \u2013 like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around \u2013 email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up.<span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n3.</span> Maybe brokers are kicking butt.\nBefore the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they\u2019d helped enroll an <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 40 to</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50 percent</span> of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 43 percent</span> of new enrollments on the state\u2019s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment.\nThe Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration\u2019s refusal to promote the law.\nEHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span>, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage.\n\u201cWeb-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO Scott Flanders told me. \u201cSo it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.\u201d<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n4.</span> Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it.\nIf the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won\u2019t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that\u2019s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn\u2019t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said.\n\u201cOutreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,\u201d Peck said.\n|You are reading The <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Health 202,</span></span> our must-read newsletter on health policy.|\n|Not a regular subscriber?|\n| |\nAHH: There\u2019s an expensive big fight brewing between two powerful lobbies -- hospitals and drug makers -- around an obscure drug discount program called 340B, Politico's David Pittman reports. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The program is supposed to help rural and charity hospitals by offsetting the cost of medicines for these low-income providers with discounted drugs.</span> But 340B has grown exponentially, now <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">comprising $16 billion</span> worth of medications dispensed in hospitals every year.\n\"Drug companies have gone on offense,\" David writes. \"In paid advertising, messaging through an army of lobbyists and on-the-record briefing of reporters, the pharmaceutical industry has crafted a message that hospitals are taking <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $6 billion</span> in drug discounts and using it to enrich themselves rather than help poor patients. They say the 340B cash has even played a role in hospitals buying up doctors\u2019 offices, causing a rise in health care costs that more than cancels out any benefit of the drug discounts.\"\n\u201cIt seems to be a perversion of this program that patients might be paying more today than they would have prior,\u201d Lori Reilly, PhRMA executive vice president, told reporters recently. \u201cThe goal of 340B was to lower costs to patients, not increase them.\u201d\n\"Hospitals deny that characterization,\" David continues. \"But it\u2019s caught the attention of at least some on the Hill. Congressional offices are drafting bills that would more tightly limit how hospitals use the discounts...The lobbying has escalated fast. <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Nearly 160 organizations</span>, almost all drug companies, hospitals and community health centers, reported lobbying on 340B last quarter, spending a <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined $41.8 million</span>, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms.\"\nOOF: A provision in the annual defense authorization bill has sparked a fiery debate over whether the Pentagon should be allowed to authorize the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices for combat soldiers, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\nUnder existing law, the FDA is the only agency that can authorize the use of medical products -- but the Defense Department can request that the FDA grant approval if there's a threat of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent on the battlefield. The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order \u201cto reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.\u201d\nThe two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.\nOUCH: \"God only knows\" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is \u201cexploiting\u201d human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a \u201csocial-validation feedback loop,\u201d Parker said, adding that it is \u201cexactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.\u201d\nParker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself \"something of a conscientious objector,\" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. \u201cI don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,\u201d Parker said.\n</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month.

Trump said that he and the president would be \"focusing on it very strongly,\" without elaborating further.\n\u201cEvery year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,\u201d Trump said standing alongside Xi, Reuters reported. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cToday President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,\" the president said.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">He added that a \u2018special emphasis\u201d would be placed on fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 50 to</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 times</span> more addictive than heroin.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson later added that Xi \"committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information.\"</span> But last week, China\u2019s drug control agency denied Trump\u2019s claim that most fentanyl is produced in China.\n-- Meanwhile, the DEA announced yesterday it's taking steps to make it easier to prosecute fentanyl traffickers by temporarily scheduling all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis. That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.\nLate last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.\n--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare.

In fact, yesterday I was looking at the White House website, healthcare.gov specifically, and I have to admit the health care plan there isn't bad. It's actually pretty good,\u201d Kimmel said on his show Wednesday night.\nKimmel cited The Post\u2019s coverage of record sign ups for what he dubbed \"Trumpcare\" and read out loud messages on social media thanking him for bring \u201con Trump\u2019s side for once.\u201d Of course, the Trumpcare Kimmel is referring to is still President Obama's Affordable Care Act that Trump keeps promising to repeal.\n\u201cIf you care about health care, go to Donald Trump\u2019s website, Healthcare.gov,\" Kimmel added.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">--Health and Taxes: The Senate version of a tax bill, which Republicans rolled out yesterday, preserves the popular medical expense deduction that its House counterpart would ditch, the Hill reports.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The deduction allows people with hefty medical costs, who spend more <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> of their gross income on care, to deduct certain qualified expenses like surgery, dentists, eye care, addiction treatment programs or transportation used primarily for or essential to medical care.\n</span>\"There\u2019s always a sense that it\u2019s a good thing to continue,\u201d Sen.

limit agreed upon by the Group <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 nations</span></span>, even if it means cutting production, adding to questions over whether the plan, which goes into effect on Monday, will succeed in slowing Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Group <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 nations</span></span> on Friday agreed to cap the price of Russian crude <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $60 a</span> barrel, putting into place a complex, U.S.-backed plan to limit what Russia, the world\u2019s second largest oil exporter, can charge for its oil exports.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin\u2019s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules.</span> He said that Russia was \u201cworking on mechanisms\u201d to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,\u201d he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union\u2019s embargo on Russian crude imports.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production \u2014 which would also harm Russia\u2019s economy \u2014 questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression.</span> Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan\u2019s architects were \u201ctrying to avoid hard decisions.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $70 a</span> barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $30 a</span> barrel to significantly slash Russia\u2019s revenue.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,\nMr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is $60 instead</span> of, for example,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $30,</span> which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $100 billion</span> a year,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said.\n</span>\u201cThis money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia\u2019s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big

Nor did it indicate any concerted effort by Ukrainian forces who recently reclaimed Kherson city to push across the river and attack Russian defensive positions.\nBut analysts said the video, posted on Telegram by a detachment of the Ukrainian military\u2019s \u201cCarlson\u201d air intelligence unit, signaled Ukraine\u2019s desire to show it would continue its southern counteroffensive even as falling temperatures make fighting more challenging, and as Russian forces continue to fire from their eastern positions toward Kherson city.\nThe video, set to swelling music and apparently filmed with the intention of sending a message, shows soldiers on three speedboats crossing the river, which is hundreds of yards wide, and docking at an abandoned wooden jetty on an island where small civilian boats were moored. Aerial footage shows the Ukrainian flag draped from high on a crane in the wharf, which the video says is in Olezhky, a district opposite Kherson city. The timing and authenticity of the footage could not be independently confirmed.\n\u201cThis flag was raised by the fighters of the \u2018Carlson\u2019 special unit. It will become a bridgehead for the de-occupation of the left bank of the Kherson region,\u201d an unidentified man in military fatigues said. The left bank refers to the river\u2019s eastern bank.\nThe area on which the troops landed appeared to be empty, which is consistent with previous Ukrainian and other military reports that Russian forces had largely pulled back from the shoreline northeast of the city of Kherson. The location appeared to be a low-lying, swampy area with few roads, which analysts say Russian forces were unlikely to defend \u2014 and which was not a logical starting point for a Ukrainian military push.\nStill, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said that if confirmed, the \u201climited Ukrainian incursion onto the east bank could open avenues for Ukrainian forces to begin to operate on the east bank.\u201d\nWhen Ukraine entered Kherson city three weeks ago after Russian forces withdrew \u2014 a watershed moment in the nine-month war \u2014 its troops secured the whole of the western bank of the river in the region.

The river presents a formidable barrier, and the main bridge across, the Antonivsky, is destroyed. Analysts also say that Russian forces withdrew largely intact from Kherson and have spent weeks digging defensive barriers on the eastern side of the Dnipro. The onset of winter, too, has made military operations more difficult, both in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are defending territory they have seized in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing kind of a reduced tempo, already, of the conflict,\u201d Avril D. Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday. She said that the pace of Ukrainian operations would likely pick up in the spring.\nSmall units of Ukrainian troops have, for weeks, been running sabotage operations on the river\u2019s eastern bank, laying mines and staging ambushes. At the same time, Russia has been lobbing shells across the river at the city of Kherson and at villages to the north.\nOn Saturday, one person was killed and two others were injured in a barrage of Russian shelling, said the head of Kherson\u2019s regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, on the Telegram social messaging app.\nPARIS \u2014 An \u201cessential point\u201d in any peace talks on the war in Ukraine should be how to provide security \u201cguarantees to Russia,\u201d given Moscow\u2019s concerns over NATO, President Emmanuel Macron of France has said.\nMr. Macron\u2019s remarks, in a television interview broadcast on Saturday, picked up a theme he has pursued since before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> but has not repeated of late. \u201cWe need to prepare what we are ready to do, how we protect our allies and member states, and how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\u201cOne of the essential points we must address \u2014 as President Putin has always said \u2014 is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,\u201d he said.\nThe interview with TF1, a French television network, appeared sympathetic to the concerns of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.\nMr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.\nDuring his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.\nThere was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.\nDavid Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal on Telegram.\nHe said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was \u201cleave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.\u201d\nThe last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994.</span> Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine\u2019s \u201cindependence and sovereignty in the existing borders\u201d in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2019,</span> when he declared the need for the reinvention of \u201can architecture of security\u201d between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new \u201cstability order\u201d in Europe.\nAlthough he has condemned Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cimperial\u201d invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.\nResponding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: \u201cDevastating.\u201d\nDr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer\u2019s tweet, saying: \u201cYou know you\u2019re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin\u2019s state propaganda praises you.

A top House Democrat announced the chamber will vote Thursday to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments.\nThe House will vote on stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee roles as G.O.P. weighs her future.\nThe House will vote Thursday on whether to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, a top Democrat announced, forcing congressional Republicans to take a public stand on the Georgia freshman who endorsed conspiracy theories and calls to execute Democratic politicians before she was elected.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 Democrat</span>, said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, and that \u201cit is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Representative Greene from her committee assignments.\u201d\nHouse Democrats, incensed by a series of social media posts made by Ms. Greene before she won her seat in November, threatened earlier this week that they would take the unusual step of moving unilaterally to remove Ms. Greene from the education and budget committees if Republicans themselves did not take action.</span> Party leaders generally have authority over who represents them on committees.\nThe vote will make Republicans go on the record for the first time on whether Ms. Greene should be rebuked for her past comments.\nWhile most Republican lawmakers have privately been horrified by her rhetoric, some have argued that members of Congress should not face punishment for remarks they made before they were elected, and that allowing one party (in this case, Democrats) to take unilateral action against a lawmaker in another party would set a dangerous precedent. Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber. They are also expected to discuss the turmoil around Ms. Greene.\nSupporters of Mr. Trump want to strip Ms. Cheney of her leadership post as payback for her vote to impeach the former president. And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.\nMs. Greene\u2019s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\"

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $1,400 stimulus</span> checks, but is open to further targeting them.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">President Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he would not agree to scale back <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1,400 direct</span> payments to many Americans that are a centerpiece of <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his $1.9 trillion</span> stimulus package, but would consider restricting them to lower-income individuals as Republicans have proposed.\n</span>\u201cWe can\u2019t walk away from an <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $1,400 in</span> direct checks, because people need it,\u201d Mr. Biden told the lawmakers on a private conference call, according to two people who participated. \u201cI\u2019m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to people.\u201d\nBut he added: \u201cWe can better target the number \u2014 I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president\u2019s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.\n</span>\u201cWe need to act fast,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s about who the hell we are as a country.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Some Republicans have argued that the next round of stimulus checks should go to Americans most in need.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Under Mr. Biden\u2019s plan, the <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">full $1,400 payment</span> would be limited to individuals earning no more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $75,000 a</span> year, but those with higher incomes would receive smaller checks.\n</span>The president\u2019s signal that he was open to compromise on the matter came a couple of days after he met at the White House <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 10 Republican</span> senators who are seeking <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $618 billion</span> package they said could win bipartisan backing. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Their proposal calls for checks of up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,000 that</span> would go only to individuals earning less <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $50,000 a</span> year, with the full payment limited to those whose annual income <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was $40,000 or</span> below.\n</span>Later, Mr. Biden met separately at the White House with Senate Democrats and again discussed narrowing eligibility for the checks.\n\u201cWe did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they\u2019re targeted,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On the call with House Democrats, Mr. Biden said he was \u201cnot married to a particular, absolute number\u201d on the overall stimulus package.\n</span>\u201cWe can make compromises on several of the programs,\u201d he told them, adding, \u201cwe have to take care of the people who are hurting.\u201d\nAs for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call that that was \u201cnot in the cards.\u201d\nLuke Broadwater and\nAdvertisement\nSenate Democrats will assume chairmanships of committees under a power-sharing deal with Republicans.\nSenate Democrats will take control of the chamber\u2019s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided. It will allow equal party representation on committees but in the cases of tie votes, legislation or nominees will still advance to the floor for consideration.\nThough the Senate is split 50-50, Democrats are in control by virtue of the power of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote. The formal organizing resolution is expected to be considered later Wednesday.\nBrian Sicknick, the officer who died from the Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span>, is honored in a ceremony at the Capitol he helped protect.\nIn the same room that rioters stormed last month, lawmakers gathered in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday for a memorial service to honor Brian D.

Austin III; and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington. Before the service, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also paid their respects.\nMr. Sicknick\u2019s remains were delivered to the Capitol on Tuesday evening, passing through a set of doors still shattered from the events of Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Officers from his unit, some on mountain bikes, lined up near the steps outside.\nMinutes later, President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, departed the White House to pay their respects.\n\u201cWe must be vigilant, as what President Lincoln referred to as the harsh artillery of time, we will never forget,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday during the ceremony near a table where Mr. Sicknick\u2019s remains and an American flag were placed. \u201cEach day when members enter the Capitol, this temple of democracy, we will remember his sacrifice and then others that day who fought so hard to protect the Capitol and the Congress.\u201d\nWalking out of the rotunda after the service, Representatives Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, and Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, paid their final respects side by side.\nAt <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 14 other</span> Capitol Police officers were injured in the attack, according to a memo issued by the F.B.I. Two police officers who responded to the siege have since died by suicide.\n\u201cKnowing our personal tragedy and loss is shared by our nation brings hope for healing,\u201d Mr. Sicknick\u2019s partner, Sandra Garza, and his family said in a statement.\nAs he left the Capitol for the final time, Mr. Sicknick was met by rows of officers, saluting the hearse that drove his remains to Arlington National Cemetery.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Katie Rogers and\nA huge majority of Americans, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, support <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1,400 stimulus</span> checks President Biden is calling for, and his <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">full $1.9 trillion</span> stimulus proposal also has strong public backing, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The poll found <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 78 percent</span> of Americans supported the stimulus checks, <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 90 percent</span> of Democrats <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and<span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 64 percent</span></span> of Republicans \u2014 suggesting that Republicans in Congress who want to reduce the checks <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,000 are</span> out of step with their constituents on this issue.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The full stimulus package proposal \u2014 which includes <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1,400 checks</span> as well as state and local aid, expanded unemployment benefits and other provisions \u2014 <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 68 percent</span> support over all, with backing <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 97 percent</span> of Democrats <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 37 percent</span> of Republicans.</span> While Republicans are often overwhelmingly against Democratic spending proposals, <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 47 percent</span> of Republicans said they definitively opposed the package.

Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cOur admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.\u201d\nThe \u201cnotice of voluntary dismissal\u201d of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department\u2019s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit \u201cin light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,\u201d including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard\u2019s admissions practices.\nBut the department said that it would continue an \u201cunderlying investigation\u201d to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.\nThe Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.\n\u201cIt is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,\u201d said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. \u201cUsing race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The government said that race was the \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that \u201cfor the great majority of applicants,\u201d Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.\nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.\nYale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.\nShe and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol?

It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees</h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees\nRepublicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene.

Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber.

And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.\nMs. Greene\u2019s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\"

added: \u201cWe can better target the number \u2014 I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president\u2019s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.\n</span>\u201cWe need to act fast,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s about who the hell we are as a country.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\"

be modified in a way to ensure they\u2019re targeted,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On the call with House Democrats, Mr.

adding, \u201cwe have to take care of the people who are hurting.\u201d\nAs for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call

will take control of the chamber\u2019s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided.

House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d\nAt home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting."}, "89039": {"id": "89039", "text": "<h3>U.S. Ally South Korea Nears Pivotal Election</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Presidential Vote Comes as Economic and Territorial Tensions Rise; Candidate Reaches Out to Her Father's Foes for Help\n\nUpdated Dec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 8</span>:01 pm ET\n\nJEONJU, South Korea\u2014Park Geun-hye is vying to become South Korea's first woman president.</span> To do so, she is reaching out to some of the people who were arrested, jailed and even exiled when her father was president in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Wednesday's election comes at a pivotal time for both Asia and for South Korea, a key U.S. ally and a growing economic force in the world.</span> Korean brands like Samsung, LG and Hyundai have become household names around the world.

Though not as expansive as Mr. Moon's, they represent a significant shift to the middle from when she ran for president five years ago and narrowly lost the conservative party nomination to Mr. Lee.\n\nOn security matters, Ms. Park favors diplomatic engagement and what she calls \"trust building\" with North Korea. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Mr. Moon wants to go further by returning to the few-questions-asked economic assistance South Korea provided to the North under the most recent liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun.</span> Mr. Moon was Mr. Roh's presidential chief of staff.\n\nNorth Korea injected itself into the election last week by firing a long-range missile. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon criticized Pyongyang, and, with South Koreans accustomed to the North's provocations, it hasn't turned into a major issue.\n\nWhile the division between North Korea and South Korea is most visible to the world, another division exists inside the South that is nearly as sharp. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It is between the country's southeastern provinces, which were home to most of its industry and benefited most from the economic choices of Ms. Park's father in the 1960s and 1970s, and its southwestern ones, which spawned the democracy movement that rebelled against him.\n\n</span>Mr. Moon,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59 years</span> old, is from the country's southeastern province, the conservative power base. His election to parliament in April was the first time a liberal had been elected from his district in Busan, the country's second-largest city.

He accepted no dissent, controlled the press and, for a time, wouldn't allow people to congregate on the streets in groups of more than six.\n\nIn <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 1974,</span> a North Korean agent fired shots at him during a speech. As security agents took down the would-be assassin, a stray bullet struck Ms. Park's mother, who died a few hours later. <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Then 22,</span> Ms. Park took on the role of first lady, presiding over ceremonies and hosting state events until her father was shot and killed by his security chief <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1979.</span>\n\nShe withdrew from the spotlight through the 1980s, the period when South Korea formed a middle class and democracy activism spread beyond the university campuses and leftist groups. <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1987,</span> a new constitution formed the country's modern political system, with presidents elected to single, five-year terms.\n\nAs <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1987 constitution</span> took effect, many people who had fled or were exiled in the 1970s returned to South Korea. Among them was Kim Kyung-jae, who had his passport revoked while on a trip to the U.S. <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972,</span> then wrote books critical of Ms. Park's father.\n\nHe returned to South Jeolla province in the southwest and became an aide to a prominent anti-Park antagonist elected as president <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1997.</span></span> Mr. Kim later won election himself to parliament.\n\nThere, he was assigned to a committee with Ms. Park. But while they often sat near each other, Mr. Kim says he never spoke to her because he wasn't sure how to break the ice. \"I had written a five-volume book criticizing her father,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, with her eyes set on <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2012 race</span>, Ms. Park asked aides to reach out to associates of her father's antagonist, the former liberal President Kim Dae-jung, who died <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span> She wanted to discuss issues and their potential support, officials with her campaign said, knowing that some of the former associates had been alienated by younger leaders from the liberal party and might help her pick up some votes in the southwestern provinces.\n\nIn a written answer to questions submitted to her campaign, Ms. Park said she wants to end South Korea's regional division. \"I also believe that national unity cannot be achieved solely through reconciling with the past,\" she wrote. Ms. Park also said she would seek \"more balanced development between regions.\"\n\nShe isn't the first president trying to bridge the gap. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1999,</span> the second year of his presidency, Kim Dae-jung visited the birthplace of Ms. Park's father and announced a plan to build a memorial park to the man he had fought for years, saying Mr. Park had instilled South Koreans with a \"can-do spirit.\"\n\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2004,</span> about a year after the president had left office, Ms. Park visited his home in Seoul and apologized for the suffering he experienced at her father's hand and thanked him for the park. \"I tried hard but still failed to accomplish regional harmony,\" the former president told her, according to Korean media reports at the time. \"I think you are the right person to seek it.\"\n\nIn the statement provided by the campaign, Ms. Park said she remembered the former president's admonition. \"I wholeheartedly agreed with President Kim's aspirations,\" she said.\n\nThis August, the day after winning her party's nomination, Ms. Park visited the graves of all of South Korea's former presidents, in what she called an effort at national unity. But in early September, she appeared to agree with a controversial verdict against dissidents by her father's government. Some people felt she was criticizing those who stood up to her father.\n\nMs. Park called Kim Kyung-jae, her former committee mate, for help, Mr. Kim said. He said he told her that he remained critical of her father and that she needed to clear the air about the other activists.\n\nOn Sept.<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> Ms. Park gave a 10-minute, televised speech in which she criticized her father in the strongest terms she had ever expressed publicly. But she added that he was still her father.\n\n\"Respected people, I don't believe that you really want me to spit on my father's grave,\" she said in the speech. \"Looking back, so many people tried hard for industrialization and democratization. Now, I think we need to put our efforts together, with respect, for even bigger national development.\"\n\nShortly after the speech, Mr. Kim said Ms. Park called him. He said that he told her, \"It was much stronger than I imagined. Now I will help you.\" A campaign spokesman said Mr. Kim joined the campaign after the speech, but he said he couldn't verify details of Ms. Park's conversations.\n\nMr. Kim joined Han Gwang-ok, who had been presidential chief of staff to Kim Dae-jung, at the head of the national unity committee inside Ms. Park's campaign.\n\nMr. Han, who was imprisoned twice by her father's regime, had similarly been recruited for months by Ms. Park's aides. He said he remembered Kim Dae-jung's goodwill to Ms. Park after <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">her 2004 meeting</span> with the former president.\n\n\"In life, there are things to quickly leave off and things to hang on to,\" Mr. Han said. \"The things to throw away are the unpleasant things from the past. The things to keep are patriotism and how to live the rest of life with dignity.\"\n\nKim Hyun-jang, an activist in the South Jeolla city of Gwangju who was imprisoned for <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1982 arson</span> at a U.S. cultural center that was one of the most violent acts of the democracy movement, also joined Ms. Park's campaign. Unlike the former politicians, he said he had no difficult rationalizing his support for Ms. Park with his disdain for her father. \"In that time, there was no freedom at all,\" he said. \"Everything is different.\"\n\nThe three men and others have been meeting friends and associates in the Jeolla provinces to court voters. But they often have been received coolly. A columnist at a Gwangju newspaper called them \"political migratory birds.\"\n\nOthers are willing to give her a chance. Ms. Park recently spoke at at Chonbuk National University in North Jeolla. \"There are still regional objections to her,\" said Kim Du-yong, a student who watched her. \"She can overcome them if she brings investment here.\"\n\nKim Kyung-jae, who stood with Ms. Park on the stage in Jeonju, said afterward that some of his friends and former constituents in the area call him a \"betrayer\" for helping her. \"I admit some of their criticisms, but still I think I have some influence on Jeolla voters,\" he said.\n\nMin Sun Lee contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Evan Ramstad at evan.ramstad@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "<h3>U.S. Ally South Korea Nears Pivotal Election</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Presidential Vote Comes as Economic and Territorial Tensions Rise; Candidate Reaches Out to Her Father's Foes for Help\n\nUpdated Dec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 8</span>:01 pm ET\n\nJEONJU, South Korea\u2014Park Geun-hye is vying to become South Korea's first woman president.</span> To do so, she is reaching out to some of the people who were arrested, jailed and even exiled when her father was president in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Wednesday's election comes at a pivotal time for both Asia and for South Korea, a key U.S. ally and a growing economic force in the world.</span> Korean brands like Samsung, LG and Hyundai have become household names around the world.

Ms. Park also said she would seek \"more balanced development between regions.\"\n\nShe isn't the first president trying to bridge the gap. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1999,</span> the second year of his presidency, Kim Dae-jung visited the birthplace of Ms. Park's father and announced a plan to build a memorial park to the man he had fought for years, saying Mr. Park had instilled South Koreans with a \"can-do spirit.\"\n\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2004,</span> about a year after the president had left office, Ms. Park visited his home in Seoul and apologized for the suffering he experienced at her father's hand and thanked him for the park. \"I tried hard but still failed to accomplish regional harmony,\" the former president told her, according to Korean media reports at the time. \"I think you are the right person to seek it.\"\n\nIn the statement provided by the campaign, Ms. Park said she remembered the former president's admonition. \"I wholeheartedly agreed with President Kim's aspirations,\" she said.\n\nThis August, the day after winning her party's nomination, Ms. Park visited the graves of all of South Korea's former presidents, in what she called an effort at national unity. But in early September, she appeared to agree with a controversial verdict against dissidents by her father's government. Some people felt she was criticizing those who stood up to her father.\n\nMs. Park called Kim Kyung-jae, her former committee mate, for help, Mr. Kim said. He said he told her that he remained critical of her father and that she needed to clear the air about the other activists.\n\nOn Sept.<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> Ms. Park gave a 10-minute, televised speech in which she criticized her father in the strongest terms she had ever expressed publicly. But she added that he was still her father.\n\n\"Respected people, I don't believe that you really want me to spit on my father's grave,\" she said in the speech. \"Looking back, so many people tried hard for industrialization and democratization. Now, I think we need to put our efforts together, with respect, for even bigger national development.\"\n\nShortly after the speech, Mr. Kim said Ms. Park called him. He said that he told her, \"It was much stronger than I imagined. Now I will help you.\" A campaign spokesman said Mr. Kim joined the campaign after the speech, but he said he couldn't verify details of Ms. Park's conversations.\n\nMr. Kim joined Han Gwang-ok, who had been presidential chief of staff to Kim Dae-jung, at the head of the national unity committee inside Ms. Park's campaign.\n\nMr. Han, who was imprisoned twice by her father's regime, had similarly been recruited for months by Ms. Park's aides. He said he remembered Kim Dae-jung's goodwill to Ms. Park after <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">her 2004 meeting</span> with the former president.\n\n\"In life, there are things to quickly leave off and things to hang on to,\" Mr. Han said. \"The things to throw away are the unpleasant things from the past. The things to keep are patriotism and how to live the rest of life with dignity.\"\n\nKim Hyun-jang, an activist in the South Jeolla city of Gwangju who was imprisoned for <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1982 arson</span> at a U.S. cultural center that was one of the most violent acts of the democracy movement, also joined Ms. Park's campaign. Unlike the former politicians, he said he had no difficult rationalizing his support for Ms. Park with his disdain for her father. \"In that time, there was no freedom at all,\" he said. \"Everything is different.\"\n\nThe three men and others have been meeting friends and associates in the Jeolla provinces to court voters. But they often have been received coolly. A columnist at a Gwangju newspaper called them \"political migratory birds.\"\n\nOthers are willing to give her a chance. Ms. Park recently spoke at at Chonbuk National University in North Jeolla. \"There are still regional objections to her,\" said Kim Du-yong, a student who watched her. \"She can overcome them if she brings investment here.\"\n\nKim Kyung-jae, who stood with Ms. Park on the stage in Jeonju, said afterward that some of his friends and former constituents in the area call him a \"betrayer\" for helping her. \"I admit some of their criticisms, but still I think I have some influence on Jeolla voters,\" he said.\n\nMin Sun Lee contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Evan Ramstad at evan.ramstad@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "6425": {"id": "6425", "text": "<h3>Big Oil Companies Binge on Debt</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Big Oil Companies Binge on Debt\nExxon, Shell, BP and Chevron have combined debt <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $184 billion</span></span> amid two-year slump\nSome of the world\u2019s largest energy companies are saddled with their highest debt levels ever as they struggle with low crude prices, raising worries about their ability to pay dividends and find new barrels.\n</span>Exxon Mobil Corp. <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">XOM 0.34 </span>% , Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A -0.76 % PLC, BP <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">BP 0.41 </span>% PLC and Chevron Corp. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">CVX 0.51 </span>% hold a combined net debt <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $184 billion</span></span>\u2014more than double their debt levels <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when oil prices began a steep descent that eventually bottomed out <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $27 a</span> barrel earlier this year.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Crude prices have rebounded since, but still hover <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near<span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $50 a</span></span> barrel.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The soaring debt levels are a fresh reminder of the toll the two-year price slump has taken on the oil industry.</span> Just a decade ago, these four companies were hauled before Congress to explain \u201cwindfall profits\u201d but now can\u2019t cover expenses with normal cash flow.\nExecutives at BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron have assured investors that they will generate enough cash <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 to</span> pay for new investments and dividends, but some shareholders are skeptical.

more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span> across a range of energy funds, including shares in Exxon, BP, Chevron and Shell.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The oil companies say they have many tools to deploy to help defray debt, including selling assets and offering shareholders more shares instead of a cash dividend, as well as continuing to cut costs.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Record-low interest rates are helping ease some of the pain.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They also say the steep levels of debt are temporary as the companies restructure, and the debt will fall when oil prices rise.\n</span>\u2018These companies won\u2019t be able to maintain the current dividends <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\"

during last month\u2019s earnings disclosures.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The company reported a rise in net debt to <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $75 billion</span> at the end of the second quarter, in large part because of its acquisition of BG Group PLC.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">BP has said it expects to be able to pay for its

analysts and investors say the oil slump is making it harder than ever for companies to raise money with asset sales to pay off debt.</span> Handing out more shares to shareholders is only storing up the dividend problem for the future when the companies will need to pay up. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Even the boost many companies got from bumper profits from their refining divisions\u2014which tend to do well when prices are low\u2014looks to be coming to an end as a glut of gasoline erodes fuel prices, say investors and analysts.\n</span>Still, some funds see BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron as big enough to weather problems for the next year and a half. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Wilmington Trust has reduced its exposure to energy companies it deems more risky in favor of other

But internet-service providers such as Comcast Corp. or Verizon Communications Inc. would be free to make all sorts of big changes, such as offering new packages with pricing schemes that deliver some kinds of content but not others. One type of service that could proliferate in the new regime is zero-rating deals, where specific websites or services are exempted from a mobile carrier\u2019s data caps.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In his official comment on Thursday, Mr. Pai, the architect of the new rules, emphasized the need to reinvigorate broadband investment in the face of huge and growing consumer demand.\n\n</span>\u201cSimply put, by returning to the light-touch [regulatory] framework, we are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have stronger incentives to build networks, especially in unserved areas, and to upgrade networks to gigabit speeds and [next-generation 5G wireless].... In short, it\u2019s a freer and more open internet.\u201d\n\nBut the issue, which has been the subject of public policy debates for more than a decade, has stirred activists who view a tightly regulated, open internet as a powerful force for democracy and opportunity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Those groups stepped up their activity ahead of the Thursday vote, arguing that the change threatens to hit consumers with higher prices and to Balkanize the internet.\n\n</span>Much of that opposition was led by major internet firms such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. They have worried for years that internet providers would use their outsize influence to extract unfair fees or promote their own content.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision from the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality is disappointing and harmful,\u201d said Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cAn open internet is critical for new ideas and economic opportunity\u2014and internet providers shouldn\u2019t be able to decide what people can see online or charge more for certain websites.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that it was \u201ccommitted to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support, have been approved by the courts, and are working well for every part of the internet economy.\u201d\n\n</span>The new rules could allow novel alliances between broadband providers and major entertainment, shopping, search and social-media platforms. They also open the door to new online ventures by the providers themselves.\n\nProviders could create fast lanes for favored services, including their own. One that could benefit, for example, is AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now, a streaming product that already is exempt from AT&T wireless data caps. The company could now also provide a fast lane for it, although there is no indication yet that it will.\n\nProponents of change, led by Mr. Pai, contend that fears over the open internet\u2019s demise have been exaggerated. They note that actual complaints of net-neutrality violations have been few and far between. Mr. Pai in particular expects public pressure\u2014aided by FCC transparency rules requiring the providers to disclose their practices in detail\u2014to prevent unreasonable behavior.\n\nMr. Pai has attempted to counter the predictions of doom by arguing that people will still be able to use the internet as they always have. He released a video recently in which he dressed up as Santa Claus and a Jedi warrior, in order to underscore that consumers will still be able to shop on the internet and follow their entertainment favorites.\n\nLarge cable and wireless firms such as Comcast, AT&T Inc. and Verizon that provide internet access to most consumers also sought to reassure consumers.\n\nAT&T executive Bob Quinn said in a statement that his company has made legally-binding net-neutrality commitments and doesn\u2019t intend to \u201cblock websites, nor censor online content, nor throttle or degrade traffic based on the content, nor unfairly discriminate in our treatment of internet traffic.... In short, the internet will continue to work tomorrow just as it always has.\u201d\n\nThose firms, however, have felt hobbled by <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2015 </span>rules, which restricted their ability to leverage their power over the internet\u2019s pipes. They also feared that the government would begin to regulate their pricing.\n\nMr. Pai has argued that the key to the new rules\u2019 success will be transparency\u2014the idea that consumers will know exactly what they are getting. For instance, a buyer of a monthly cellphone plan would be able to find out if access to a particular streaming-movie service is prioritized over other traffic from a rival service. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His plan envisions enforcement of that transparency by both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission, whose mission is consumer protection against anticompetitive and deceptive behaviors.\n\n</span>He has also criticized big internet companies that have opposed his plan, citing recent examples of their own blocking or prioritization of sites and services.\n\nA number of Democrats called on the commission to delay the vote in light of the fact that millions of comments submitted to the agency about the change have been found to be fake. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered thousands of fraudulent comments on the FCC\u2019s online commenting site. The FCC last week said it \u201cstrongly\u201d opposes the submission of fake comments, but Mr. Pai went ahead with the vote.\n\nDemocratic commissioners warned that the changes will open the online world to domination by providers, despite their claimed support for net-neutrality principles.\n\n\u201cWhen the current protections are abandoned, and the rules that have been officially in place <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2015 are</span> repealed, we will have a Cheshire cat version of net neutrality,\u201d said Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn. \u201cWe will be in a world where ... all that is left is a broadband provider\u2019s toothy grin and those oh-so-comforting words: We have every incentive to do the right thing. What they will soon have is every incentive to do their own thing.\u201d\n\nSeveral open-internet advocacy groups and other opponents of the rules said they planned to sue to overturn the new FCC order within weeks. Free Press, one such group, said it would challenge the FCC\u2019s definition of broadband, its justifications for the reversal and \u201cthe many process fouls that have plagued the FCC proceeding since it began earlier this year.\u201d\n\nFCC leaders believe the new order is legally defensible.\n\nJack Nicas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to John D.

It\u2019s about whether the Texas senator is just as much a finger-in-the-wind politician as the rest of the pack.\nBeyond just immigration, Rubio\u2019s campaign has blasted out a barrage of press releases and clips this week aimed at portraying Cruz as a flip-flopping politician who will say whatever makes the most political sense at the moment he says it, from crop insurance to defense spending.\n[Get more campaign scoops delivered directly to your email inbox by signing up for The Daily 202]\nCruz has also been hit by the hawks and doves in his party for what they characterize as shifting rhetoric on the U.S. role in the Middle East.\n\u201cI think that Ted Cruz is a man who is lost,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, his hawkish South Carolina colleague and rival in the presidential race. \u201cHe is trying to be an isolationist when that\u2019s hot; he\u2019s trying to be a Lindsey Graham-type when that\u2019s hot.\u201d\nRand Paul released a web video that accused Cruz of being welcoming to Syrian refugees before that became an unpopular position after the Paris attacks.\nChris Christie accused Cruz of opposing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of metadata for political, not philosophical, reasons. \u201cHe went for the easy political vote at a time when it looked like it was a popular thing to do,\u201d the New Jersey governor said on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWith all those dead Parisians, it doesn\u2019t look so popular!\u201d\nThe pro-Christie Union Leader, New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, has run a string of negative editorials pushing the same line of attack. \u201cObsequious pandering to Trump belies Cruz\u2019s well-honed reputation as a maverick standing up to party leadership in defense of conservative principles,\u201d the editorial board said in yesterday\u2019s paper. \u201cCruz had a chance to stand up for conservative principles on stage in Vegas, and he folded like a gambler with a busted flush.\u201d\nPost columnist Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s White House, calls Cruz \u201ca conviction candidate with the challenges of a chameleon\u201d: \u201cAs a presidential candidate, his superpower is to sense exactly where the right is at any given moment and get there himself, with a flourish that leads to a standing O. The problem for Cruz is that the conservative soul has been divided on foreign policy over the past decade, leaving him in an uncomfortable straddle.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a history of outsider mavericks faltering when voters judge that they\u2019re not that different from the insiders they\u2019re challenging. Recall John McCain damaging his reputation for candor <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000 when</span> he equivocated on whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. Gary Hart undermined his bid against Walter Mondale <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 when</span> he flip-flopped on whether the U.S. should move its embassy in Israel, a craven effort to win Jewish votes ahead of the New York primary.\nThe Cruz campaign calls this a false narrative that the base won\u2019t buy, especially because conservative thought leaders like Rush Limbaugh are backing them up. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cTry they might, but no one believes that Cruz is anything but a constitutional, fiscal and social conservative,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler, \u201cand he has the record, unlike his detractors, to back it up.\u201d</span> On the campaign trail, Cruz routinely describes himself as \u201ca consistent conservative.\u201d\nDavid Fahrenthold explores five of the issues on which Cruz has allegedly flip-flopped in a nuanced story that just posted: (1) Should the U.S. military intervene in Syria? (2) Should the United States admit Syrian refugees? (3) Should undocumented immigrants be given a path to legal status? (4) Should the United States offer more temporary visas to highly skilled foreigners? (5) Should money cut from <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3 billion</span> crop-insurance program be restored, giving an expensive boost to farmers?

He\u2019s not winning personality contests here. Cruz is just who he is. He just is a very, very smart man marching forward with some ideas I don\u2019t like.\u201d (Kelsey Snell\u2019s write-up)\nA new Cruz ad going on TV this morning has Cruz touting his record on immigration: \u201cSecuring our borders and stopping illegal immigration is a matter of national security,\u201d the senator says directly to the camera. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fought so hard to defeat President Obama and the Republican establishment\u2019s Gang of Eight amnesty plan.

Pollster Scott Clement points out Clinton\u2019s standing is similar to eight years ago, when she <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 28 points</span> ahead of Barack Obama (though the dynamics <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 are</span> decidedly different), and that the race is much closer in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\nClinton is being helped by the renewed focus on national security:<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 64 percent</span> say she would handle terrorism better than he would. Sanders still leads on honesty, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 44 percent</span> saying he is more honest and trustworthy than she is.\n\u2014 Another fresh poll this morning shows very little change in the GOP race after the Las Vegas debate. A Morning Consult survey that was in the field the past two nights puts Trump <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 36 percent</span> nationally, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 percent</span> for Ben Carson,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11 percent</span> for Cruz,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 percent</span> for Rubio <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 7 percent</span> for Jeb.

The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters. The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.\u201d Four key lines:\n- NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software.\n- The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.\n- Having his campaign cut off from the national party\u2019s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders \u2014 and could be a devastating blow if it lasts.\n- The episode also raises questions about the DNC\u2019s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.\n\u2014 Pope Francis cleared the way for Mother Teresa to become a saint by crediting the late nun with a second miracle (a Brazilian man who \u201cunexpectedly recovered\u201d from brain tumors <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008 after</span> praying for Teresa\u2019s help).\nGET SMART FAST:\n- A Virginia school district near Charlottesville has canceled classes for today amid furor over a geography teacher assigning students to copy Arabic calligraphy that translates to: \u201cThere is no god but Allah.

Domestic oil production has nearly doubled <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008,</span> largely because of the shale oil boom in North Dakota and Texas that led to an overabundance of light crude oil. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Most refiners in the United States are configured to process heavy or medium crude oil, leaving the producers of light crude oil with too much product and not enough refineries to buy it.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cCongress looks to clear year-end budget deal,\u201d by Kelsey Snell: \u201cCongress on Friday is poised to clear the year-end tax and spending deal as lawmakers seek to wrap up the remaining congressional business with members itching to head home for the holidays.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Despite some grumbling in both parties over the contents of the deal \u2013 <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.1 trillion</span> spending bill and <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $622 billion</span> package of tax cuts \u2013 it is expected to be approved by both chambers.</span> But the House vote on the appropriations package, which will occur Friday morning, could be close. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On Thursday the House passed the tax portion of the agreement on <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 318 to</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 109 vote</span>.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u2026 House Republicans provided most of the needed votes,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 241,</span> to pass the tax package, which House Democratic leaders oppose because they say it is too expensive and does not do enough for low-income workers.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opposed the tax agreement but said she will vote for the spending bill.\u201d</span> Pelosi also sent a letter late Thursday to House Democrats urging them to back the spending agreement.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u2014 \u201cPaul Ryan notches a big victory, but the true test may come next year,\u201d by Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane: \u201cConservatives credit Paul Ryan with moving to open the appropriations process in the immediate aftermath of the budget deal negotiated by John Boehner in his final days, an accord that lifted spending caps that many Republicans wanted to maintain.</span> Pressed about the difference under Ryan, rank-and-file lawmakers could not point to specific changes made by the new speaker. His reforms to an internal group that doles out committee assignments were cosmetic, at best, and his early decision to have a wide-open amendment process on a massive highway funding bill has been followed by mostly closed consideration of legislation that needs to pass quickly. On the Boehner vs. Ryan question, House Republicans tend to split into two camps; those who say they trust Ryan more than Boehner, and those who are giving him the early benefit of the doubt. The latter group has decided to rally around the new leader, saying that the real verdict on his leadership will come next year.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cWhat it\u2019s like in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally,\u201d by Stephanie McCrummen in Mesa, Ariz.: \u201cA white-haired man in suede wingtips would punch a protester. A young man would shout \u2018mother f\u2014ing tacos!\u2019 at two Latino protesters. \u2026 For the most part, people were not exactly coming to hear Trump. Most already knew what he had to say about banning Muslims from entering the United States, or \u2018bombing the s\u2014 \u2018 out of the Islamic State, or building a wall to keep out Mexicans he has described as rapists and drug traffickers. They had read his books, had seen him on the news. Instead, they were here to be part of something larger than themselves: part of the Trump Crowd, at this point a phenomenon in and of itself that has become more raucous and sporadically violent as this primary season of fear and anger has progressed.\u201d\n\u2014 Why the Secret Service doesn\u2019t see its agents as responsible for keeping the peace at Trump\u2019s out-of-control events: \u201cMuch of the peacekeeping burden during rallies falls on private security guards and off-duty police hired by the campaign and event venue operators,\u201d David Nakamura and Carol Leonnig write. \u201cLocal police are often on duty outside events to monitor traffic and security issues in public places, but they are not responsible for removing protesters on private property. And while the Secret Service began providing protection to Trump in November \u2026 agents are trained to intervene only if there is a direct threat to the candidate. As a result, some experts said, if shoving or fighting breaks out, it is not always clear who is responsible for protecting the safety of the public, including protesters.\u201d Secret Service officials said that engaging in crowd control could divert agents from monitoring the candidate. \u201cThe U.S. Secret Service cannot get sucked into the chaos,\u201d said Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent.\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL: Here\u2019s how the Cruz vs. Rubio spat looks through analytics.

Their worries stem from skeptical comments she has made about charter schools and teacher evaluations, as well as her close relationship with teachers\u2019 unions, who are critical of both. \u2018There are a lot of deep-pocketed donors who are concerned, and they\u2019re going to hang onto their checkbooks until there is more clarity,\u2019 said Whitney Tilson \u2026 who has given more <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 to</span> Democrats in recent years.

Richard Shelby loaded up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1.1 trillion</span> spending bill with pet provisions, including one measure worth hundreds of millions to a rocket manufacturer with operations in his home state. The cagey lawmaker also fought hard for language protecting red snapper fisheries on Alabama\u2019s Gulf Coast, even issuing a press release bragging about his efforts. \u2026 But in an only-in-Congress twist, Shelby, a very senior member on the appropriations committee, still plans to vote against the sprawling omnibus package. He\u2019s citing the lack of language to restrict Syrian refugees as the reason. The move, however, could make the Republican senator the unofficial chairman of the \u2018hope yes, vote no\u2019 caucus on Capitol Hill. It also demonstrates the potency of immigration as an electoral issue in Alabama and the power of Shelby\u2019s fellow home-state senator, Republican Jeff Sessions, over the controversial topic in the Southern state.\u201d\n\u2014 The Atlantic, \u201cWhy did Sheldon Adelson buy Nevada\u2019s largest newspaper?\u201d by Molly Ball, who was a top political reporter for the Review-Journal before coming to Washington: \u201cThe prospect of Adelson \u2014 the world\u2019s 18th-richest person, who has given tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes \u2014 owning a major piece of the media has provoked understandable anxiety.\u2026 Adelson, who gives few interviews, has a history of hostile relations with the local and national press. In one notable case, he sued a beloved R-J columnist, John L. Smith, driving him into bankruptcy at a time when Smith\u2019s young daughter was being treated for brain cancer. Smith kept fighting, and the suit was eventually dismissed.\u2026\n\u201cIn Israel, he founded a free daily named Israel Hayom that has become popular and influential with a combination of a populist-tabloid sensibility and a hard-right political line. It\u2019s been called the Fox News of Israel; locals have nicknamed it \u2018Bibiton\u2019 for its ardent support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If that\u2019s what Adelson wants for Las Vegas, there will be little to stop him \u2014 and little other place for locals to turn for their news.\u201d\nNevada\u2019s Harry Reid weighed in on the acquisition during his sit-down with The Post yesterday: \u201cI think that he will change that newspaper, and I hope so \u2014 I say that without any question.

It\u2019s about whether the Texas senator is just as much a finger-in-the-wind politician as the rest of the pack.\nBeyond just immigration, Rubio\u2019s campaign has blasted out a barrage of press releases and clips this week aimed at portraying Cruz as a flip-flopping politician who will say whatever makes the most political sense at the moment he says it, from crop insurance to defense spending.\n[Get more campaign scoops delivered directly to your email inbox by signing up for The Daily 202]\nCruz has also been hit by the hawks and doves in his party for what they characterize as shifting rhetoric on the U.S. role in the Middle East.\n\u201cI think that Ted Cruz is a man who is lost,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, his hawkish South Carolina colleague and rival in the presidential race. \u201cHe is trying to be an isolationist when that\u2019s hot; he\u2019s trying to be a Lindsey Graham-type when that\u2019s hot.\u201d\nRand Paul released a web video that accused Cruz of being welcoming to Syrian refugees before that became an unpopular position after the Paris attacks.\nChris Christie accused Cruz of opposing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of metadata for political, not philosophical, reasons. \u201cHe went for the easy political vote at a time when it looked like it was a popular thing to do,\u201d the New Jersey governor said on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWith all those dead Parisians, it doesn\u2019t look so popular!\u201d\nThe pro-Christie Union Leader, New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, has run a string of negative editorials pushing the same line of attack. \u201cObsequious pandering to Trump belies Cruz\u2019s well-honed reputation as a maverick standing up to party leadership in defense of conservative principles,\u201d the editorial board said in yesterday\u2019s paper. \u201cCruz had a chance to stand up for conservative principles on stage in Vegas, and he folded like a gambler with a busted flush.\u201d\nPost columnist Michael Gerson, a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s White House, calls Cruz \u201ca conviction candidate with the challenges of a chameleon\u201d: \u201cAs a presidential candidate, his superpower is to sense exactly where the right is at any given moment and get there himself, with a flourish that leads to a standing O. The problem for Cruz is that the conservative soul has been divided on foreign policy over the past decade, leaving him in an uncomfortable straddle.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a history of outsider mavericks faltering when voters judge that they\u2019re not that different from the insiders they\u2019re challenging. Recall John McCain damaging his reputation for candor <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000 when</span> he equivocated on whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. Gary Hart undermined his bid against Walter Mondale <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 when</span> he flip-flopped on whether the U.S. should move its embassy in Israel, a craven effort to win Jewish votes ahead of the New York primary.\nThe Cruz campaign calls this a false narrative that the base won\u2019t buy, especially because conservative thought leaders like Rush Limbaugh are backing them up. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cTry they might, but no one believes that Cruz is anything but a constitutional, fiscal and social conservative,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler, \u201cand he has the record, unlike his detractors, to back it up.\u201d</span> On the campaign trail, Cruz routinely describes himself as \u201ca consistent conservative.\u201d\nDavid Fahrenthold explores five of the issues on which Cruz has allegedly flip-flopped in a nuanced story that just posted: (1) Should the U.S. military intervene in Syria? (2) Should the United States admit Syrian refugees? (3) Should undocumented immigrants be given a path to legal status? (4) Should the United States offer more temporary visas to highly skilled foreigners? (5) Should money cut from <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3 billion</span> crop-insurance program be restored, giving an expensive boost to farmers? Read the whole thing here.\nHarry Reid blasted Rubio and defended Cruz in an interview with The Post: \u201cI just think what Rubio has done on immigration is one of the worst, worst machinations in politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the Senate minority leader said yesterday. \u201cIt shows a lack of character in my opinion.\u201d Reid said both Rubio and Cruz are \u201cnon-entities in the Senate,\u201d but he gave the Texan a back-handed compliment: \u201cYou never have to guess where he is. He\u2019s not winning personality contests here. Cruz is just who he is. He just is a very, very smart man marching forward with some ideas I don\u2019t like.\u201d (Kelsey Snell\u2019s write-up)\nA new Cruz ad going on TV this morning has Cruz touting his record on immigration: \u201cSecuring our borders and stopping illegal immigration is a matter of national security,\u201d the senator says directly to the camera. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fought so hard to defeat President Obama and the Republican establishment\u2019s Gang of Eight amnesty plan. Their misguided plan would have given Obama the authority to admit Syrian refugees, including ISIS terrorists.\u201d Watch here.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\u2014 \u201cAmerican-led airstrikes killed at <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 180 Islamic</span> State fighters as local Kurdish forces scrambled to repel a bold, multi-pronged assault by the militants,\u201d Missy Ryan and Loveday Morris report from Iraq.\n\u2014 Ahead of tomorrow night\u2019s Democratic debate, a fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Clinton with a 2-1 edge over Sanders in the national race:<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59 percent</span> of Democratic-leaning registered voters support her, compared <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 28 percent</span> for him. He\u2019s down <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 34 percent</span> in November. Pollster Scott Clement points out Clinton\u2019s standing is similar to eight years ago, when she <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 28 points</span> ahead of Barack Obama (though the dynamics <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 are</span> decidedly different), and that the race is much closer in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\nClinton is being helped by the renewed focus on national security:<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 64 percent</span> say she would handle terrorism better than he would. Sanders still leads on honesty, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 44 percent</span> saying he is more honest and trustworthy than she is.\n\u2014 Another fresh poll this morning shows very little change in the GOP race after the Las Vegas debate. A Morning Consult survey that was in the field the past two nights puts Trump <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 36 percent</span> nationally, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 percent</span> for Ben Carson,<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11 percent</span> for Cruz,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 percent</span> for Rubio <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 7 percent</span> for Jeb.

The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters. The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.\u201d Four key lines:\n- NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software.\n- The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.\n- Having his campaign cut off from the national party\u2019s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders \u2014 and could be a devastating blow if it lasts.\n- The episode also raises questions about the DNC\u2019s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.\n\u2014 Pope Francis cleared the way for Mother Teresa to become a saint by crediting the late nun with a second miracle (a Brazilian man who \u201cunexpectedly recovered\u201d from brain tumors <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2008 after</span> praying for Teresa\u2019s help).\nGET SMART FAST:\n- A Virginia school district near Charlottesville has canceled classes for today amid furor over a geography teacher assigning students to copy Arabic calligraphy that translates to: \u201cThere is no god but Allah.

His reforms to an internal group that doles out committee assignments were cosmetic, at best, and his early decision to have a wide-open amendment process on a massive highway funding bill has been followed by mostly closed consideration of legislation that needs to pass quickly. On the Boehner vs. Ryan question, House Republicans tend to split into two camps; those who say they trust Ryan more than Boehner, and those who are giving him the early benefit of the doubt. The latter group has decided to rally around the new leader, saying that the real verdict on his leadership will come next year.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cWhat it\u2019s like in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally,\u201d by Stephanie McCrummen in Mesa, Ariz.: \u201cA white-haired man in suede wingtips would punch a protester. A young man would shout \u2018mother f\u2014ing tacos!\u2019 at two Latino protesters. \u2026 For the most part, people were not exactly coming to hear Trump. Most already knew what he had to say about banning Muslims from entering the United States, or \u2018bombing the s\u2014 \u2018 out of the Islamic State, or building a wall to keep out Mexicans he has described as rapists and drug traffickers. They had read his books, had seen him on the news. Instead, they were here to be part of something larger than themselves: part of the Trump Crowd, at this point a phenomenon in and of itself that has become more raucous and sporadically violent as this primary season of fear and anger has progressed.\u201d\n\u2014 Why the Secret Service doesn\u2019t see its agents as responsible for keeping the peace at Trump\u2019s out-of-control events: \u201cMuch of the peacekeeping burden during rallies falls on private security guards and off-duty police hired by the campaign and event venue operators,\u201d David Nakamura and Carol Leonnig write. \u201cLocal police are often on duty outside events to monitor traffic and security issues in public places, but they are not responsible for removing protesters on private property. And while the Secret Service began providing protection to Trump in November \u2026 agents are trained to intervene only if there is a direct threat to the candidate. As a result, some experts said, if shoving or fighting breaks out, it is not always clear who is responsible for protecting the safety of the public, including protesters.\u201d Secret Service officials said that engaging in crowd control could divert agents from monitoring the candidate. \u201cThe U.S. Secret Service cannot get sucked into the chaos,\u201d said Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent.\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL: Here\u2019s how the Cruz vs. Rubio spat looks through analytics.

In a private session at the White House, Mr. Obama explained that his refusal to redeploy large numbers of troops to the region was rooted in the grim assumption that the casualties and costs would rival the worst of the Iraq war. Such a renewed commitment, he said, could require up <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $10 billion</span> a month and leave as many <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 500 troops</span> wounded every month in addition to those killed\u2026.

Their worries stem from skeptical comments she has made about charter schools and teacher evaluations, as well as her close relationship with teachers\u2019 unions, who are critical of both. \u2018There are a lot of deep-pocketed donors who are concerned, and they\u2019re going to hang onto their checkbooks until there is more clarity,\u2019 said Whitney Tilson \u2026 who has given more <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $150,000 to</span> Democrats in recent years.

Richard Shelby loaded up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1.1 trillion</span> spending bill with pet provisions, including one measure worth hundreds of millions to a rocket manufacturer with operations in his home state. The cagey lawmaker also fought hard for language protecting red snapper fisheries on Alabama\u2019s Gulf Coast, even issuing a press release bragging about his efforts. \u2026 But in an only-in-Congress twist, Shelby, a very senior member on the appropriations committee, still plans to vote against the sprawling omnibus package. He\u2019s citing the lack of language to restrict Syrian refugees as the reason. The move, however, could make the Republican senator the unofficial chairman of the \u2018hope yes, vote no\u2019 caucus on Capitol Hill. It also demonstrates the potency of immigration as an electoral issue in Alabama and the power of Shelby\u2019s fellow home-state senator, Republican Jeff Sessions, over the controversial topic in the Southern state.\u201d\n\u2014 The Atlantic, \u201cWhy did Sheldon Adelson buy Nevada\u2019s largest newspaper?\u201d by Molly Ball, who was a top political reporter for the Review-Journal before coming to Washington: \u201cThe prospect of Adelson \u2014 the world\u2019s 18th-richest person, who has given tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes \u2014 owning a major piece of the media has provoked understandable anxiety.\u2026 Adelson, who gives few interviews, has a history of hostile relations with the local and national press. In one notable case, he sued a beloved R-J columnist, John L. Smith, driving him into bankruptcy at a time when Smith\u2019s young daughter was being treated for brain cancer. Smith kept fighting, and the suit was eventually dismissed.\u2026\n\u201cIn Israel, he founded a free daily named Israel Hayom that has become popular and influential with a combination of a populist-tabloid sensibility and a hard-right political line. It\u2019s been called the Fox News of Israel; locals have nicknamed it \u2018Bibiton\u2019 for its ardent support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He even copies his haircut and dress\n\nUpdated Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 1</span>:51 am ET\n\nSEOUL\u2014Kim Jong Un was a virtual unknown when his father died of a heart attack in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011 and</span> left him the leader of North Korea.\n\nIntelligence analysts knew little more than he was a man in his 20s who had attended school in Switzerland and loved basketball. Some guessed Mr. Kim, third in a line of Kim-family dictators, would be a weak, short-lived ruler. Governments abroad feared a violent collapse, but also hoped that the end of the family\u2019s rule would reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.\n\nInstead of chaos, however, there appeared to be a plan, according to experts on the tightly closed country.\n\nMr. Kim has solidified his command by cloaking brutality in the folksy style and pragmatic politics of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation\u2019s founder whom many still regard with nostalgia and reverence. Mr. Kim has mirrored his grandfather\u2019s propaganda and policies, even his style of dress.\n\nWhile purging potential challengers, particularly among North Korea\u2019s generals, Mr. Kim has strengthened his military support with a nuclear-arms push.\n\nIn short, Mr. Kim has turned out to be a \u201cvery skilled dictator,\u201d said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert and professor at Troy University in Seoul.\n\nAfter its latest nuclear test this month, North Korea said it could now rapidly churn out nuclear warheads for its missiles, a claim impossible to verify. Experts suspect North Korea is only a few years away from the capability of striking the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">While buttressing the military with arms spending, Mr. Kim has gained domestic backing and prestige with high-profile construction projects in the capital city of Pyongyang, say defectors, and by allowing growth of a rudimentary market economy\u2014though his popularity is difficult to accurately gauge.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">North Korea has more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 million</span> mobile-phone subscribers and a new class of private traders and financiers despite the country\u2019s official communist orthodoxy, defectors say.\n\n</span>To the rest of the world, Mr. Kim\u2019s acceleration of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u2014more powerful bombs and improved missiles to deliver them\u2014makes him an especially dangerous leader.\n\nLooking back, it appears that Kim Jong Un and his aides likely decided from the start that the new leader should emulate his popular grandfather rather than his dour father, said Michael Madden, a U.S.-based North Korea expert. Many of those aides worked with both previous leaders.\n\nFor starters, Kim Jong Un looked remarkably like a younger version of his grandfather, both in his stocky build and facial features. Mr. Kim, believed now to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 32 years</span> old, had his hair closely cropped in his grandfather\u2019s style and wore the black Mao-style uniforms and western suits favored by Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe embalmed body of Kim Il Sung, who ruled from the country\u2019s founding <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1948 until</span> his death <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span> lies in a viewing case at an airport-sized mausoleum. Most citizens wear a badge with his picture on the left side of their chest.\n\nHe is known in North Korea for leading guerrilla forces against Japanese colonists in the 1930s. He triggered the Korean War <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1950 by</span> invading South Korea, but North Korean schools teach that he saved the country from the armies of Seoul and Washington.\n\nKim Il Sung is also remembered for his country\u2019s relative prosperity after the war, helped by North Korea\u2019s concentration of heavy industry and mineral resources. For around two decades, North Korea\u2019s estimated output surpassed South Korea\u2019s. Even some defectors laud his skills in hindsight.\n\nBy contrast, Kim Il Sung\u2019s son and successor, Kim Jong Il, ruled during a 1990s famine that killed more than a million people. Under a so-called military-first policy, he demanded austerity from rank-and-file citizens to make sure the armed forces had all the resources they needed.\n\nKim Jong Il cracked down on private wealth while enjoying a lavish private lifestyle. His khaki jumpsuits drew ridicule abroad. He also was a recluse, whose voice was broadcast only once during his 17-year rule.\n\nThese days, state propaganda highlight his son, Kim Jong Un, as a man of the people, just like his grandfather. A few months after he assumed power, state TV showed him bringing gifts and pouring drinks for families who had just moved into new apartments in Pyongyang. His wife washed dishes.\n\nKim Jong Un also moved away from his father\u2019s demands for austerity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Instead, he resurrected a policy of his grandfather\u2019s known as the dual-track: The state would pursue both economic growth and nuclear weapons.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Kim has thousands of soldiers building recreational and housing projects in Pyongyang, which are showcased by state-run newspapers and TV as evidence of economic advancement.\n\n</span>Alongside a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and redeveloped streets in Pyongyang, known among foreigners as \u201cLittle Dubai,\u201d are new riding stables, a water park and dolphin aquarium. Visitors to the new zoo enter through a gate shaped like a giant tiger\u2019s mouth.\n\nAn analysis of state media reports on tours by North Korean leaders shows <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 20% of</span> Kim Jong Un\u2019s so-called guidance visits have been at leisure spots and construction projects, places where his father rarely appeared.\n\nDuring a visit\u2014billed as an inspection\u2014to the Pyongyang zoo this year, Mr. Kim said it would help visitors see North Korea\u2019s \u201cstrength and civilization.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">North Korean officials say these projects show that economic pressures from abroad are futile.</span> \u201dYou can see that sanctions on us have no effect,\u201d a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said in a recent interview.\n\nOutside the country, those claims draw skepticism. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Pyongyang releases no official economic statistics, but South Korea\u2019s central bank estimates that North Korea\u2019s economy grew around half a percentage point each year <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> driven mostly by mineral exports.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Two Western diplomats who recently traveled through rural North Korea on separate visits said clear signs of poverty remained.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Yet a loosening of economic restrictions appears to be raising living standards a bit, according to defectors and recent visitors.\n\n</span>Despite North Korea\u2019s longstanding ban on private enterprise, Mr. Kim has allowed some street markets and small businesses. Smartphones are hot sellers, though primarily Chinese-made models that don\u2019t connect to the internet, which is largely banned. Such illegal goods as foreign movies recorded on memory cards are also sold in markets, said Sokeel Park of the group Liberty in North Korea, a nongovernmental organization that helps defectors.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Kim Kwang-Jin, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and banker, said Mr. Kim has tolerated free-market sales as a potential source of tax income.\n\n</span>The dictator\u2019s populist image is cultivated by state media accounts of Mr. Kim getting angry with officials who, for instance, give incorrect weather forecasts or let weeds sprout through the pavement of an amusement park.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s public image of warmth toward his citizens contrasts with his ruthless elimination of potential rivals, including <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 execution</span> of his uncle, whom he called \u201cfactional filth.\u201d Mr. Kim has demoted or purged more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 top</span> officials, according to South Korean government estimates.\n\nEvan Medeiros, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House National Security Council for two years from mid-2013, said U.S. officials became increasingly persuaded of Mr. Kim\u2019s potential longevity as his rule progressed.\n\n\u201cOnce the major purges took place, we thought he was solid,\u201d said Mr. Medeiros, who is now Asia head for consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather also consolidated power through purges of potential challengers <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1953,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1956,</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1967.</span> None, however, were known to rival the execution by antiaircraft fire of a North Korean defense minister under Mr. Kim, as alleged last year by South Korea\u2019s spy agency.\n\nThe recent purges appear to pave the way for Mr. Kim to reassert the authority of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, another echo of his grandfather\u2019s. The party was used by Kim Il Sung to oversee and control his citizens and government. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">His son, Kim Jong Il, ceded more authority to the military, allowing it take over lucrative businesses in mining and foreign trade.\n\n</span>This year, at the first party congress <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 36 years</span>, Mr. Kim replaced a military-dominated governing body with one made up mostly of politicians. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the shift also puts economic management back in the hands of presumably more capable technocrats.\n\n</span>While reducing the role of the military in politics, Mr. Kim has accelerated the development of weapons of mass destruction, his grandfather\u2019s dream.\n\nKim Il Sung started North Korea\u2019s nuclear program with help from the Soviet Union. After the collapse of its former patron, the former North Korean leader agreed to a deal with the U.S. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994 that</span> froze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear work for almost a decade. It later emerged that North Korea had maintained a secret program to enrich uranium, one type of fuel for an atomic bomb.\n\nThree of North Korea\u2019s five nuclear tests have been conducted under Kim Jong Un\u2019s reign, and he has more than doubled <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 16 ballistic</span> missile tests held under his father.\n\nRecent successful tests of missiles launched from a mobile carrier and a submarine show North Korea is also gaining the capacity to hit back even if its military bases are destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s failed policy has allowed us to build a full nuclear deterrent, including counterstrike ability,\u201d the senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said.\n\nU.S. officials say they have pursued all avenues to reduce the threat from North Korea. Earlier this year, U.S. officials offered talks about ending the armed standoff on the Korean Peninsula if Pyongyang would discuss scrapping its nuclear program. The idea was rejected.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, used North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a bargaining chip for aid and security guarantees. Diplomats and experts say Mr. Kim uses the nuclear program instead to enhance his standing with the military and to intimidate South Korea, with little concern for diplomatic fallout. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Even ties with China\u2014the North\u2019s economic lifeline, defender and sole major ally\u2014have been strained by Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear push.\n\n</span>Mr. Kim\u2019s unexpected resilience has forced Washington to recalculate the scale of the threat North Korea poses to the world, as well as U.S. responses.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and its allies have pledged to step up economic sanctions against North Korea.</span> The U.S. has little power to directly pressure Pyongyang because it has almost no links to the isolated regime. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Efforts are instead focused on persuading countries with economic and diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The U.S. would like to reduce North Korea\u2019s export of coal and other minerals, almost all of which are sold to China.</span> Beijing, however, is strongly resistant to any action that might destabilize North Korea and send a flood of refugees over its shared border.

Some guessed Mr. Kim, third in a line of Kim-family dictators, would be a weak, short-lived ruler. Governments abroad feared a violent collapse, but also hoped that the end of the family\u2019s rule would reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.\n\nInstead of chaos, however, there appeared to be a plan, according to experts on the tightly closed country.\n\nMr. Kim has solidified his command by cloaking brutality in the folksy style and pragmatic politics of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation\u2019s founder whom many still regard with nostalgia and reverence. Mr. Kim has mirrored his grandfather\u2019s propaganda and policies, even his style of dress.\n\nWhile purging potential challengers, particularly among North Korea\u2019s generals, Mr. Kim has strengthened his military support with a nuclear-arms push.\n\nIn short, Mr. Kim has turned out to be a \u201cvery skilled dictator,\u201d said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert and professor at Troy University in Seoul.\n\nAfter its latest nuclear test this month, North Korea said it could now rapidly churn out nuclear warheads for its missiles, a claim impossible to verify. Experts suspect North Korea is only a few years away from the capability of striking the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">While buttressing the military with arms spending, Mr. Kim has gained domestic backing and prestige with high-profile construction projects in the capital city of Pyongyang, say defectors, and by allowing growth of a rudimentary market economy\u2014though his popularity is difficult to accurately gauge.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">North Korea has more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 million</span> mobile-phone subscribers and a new class of private traders and financiers despite the country\u2019s official communist orthodoxy, defectors say.\n\n</span>To the rest of the world, Mr. Kim\u2019s acceleration of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u2014more powerful bombs and improved missiles to deliver them\u2014makes him an especially dangerous leader.\n\nLooking back, it appears that Kim Jong Un and his aides likely decided from the start that the new leader should emulate his popular grandfather rather than his dour father, said Michael Madden, a U.S.-based North Korea expert. Many of those aides worked with both previous leaders.\n\nFor starters, Kim Jong Un looked remarkably like a younger version of his grandfather, both in his stocky build and facial features. Mr. Kim, believed now to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 32 years</span> old, had his hair closely cropped in his grandfather\u2019s style and wore the black Mao-style uniforms and western suits favored by Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe embalmed body of Kim Il Sung, who ruled from the country\u2019s founding <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1948 until</span> his death <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span> lies in a viewing case at an airport-sized mausoleum. Most citizens wear a badge with his picture on the left side of their chest.\n\nHe is known in North Korea for leading guerrilla forces against Japanese colonists in the 1930s. He triggered the Korean War <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1950 by</span> invading South Korea, but North Korean schools teach that he saved the country from the armies of Seoul and Washington.\n\nKim Il Sung is also remembered for his country\u2019s relative prosperity after the war, helped by North Korea\u2019s concentration of heavy industry and mineral resources. For around two decades, North Korea\u2019s estimated output surpassed South Korea\u2019s. Even some defectors laud his skills in hindsight.\n\nBy contrast, Kim Il Sung\u2019s son and successor, Kim Jong Il, ruled during a 1990s famine that killed more than a million people. Under a so-called military-first policy, he demanded austerity from rank-and-file citizens to make sure the armed forces had all the resources they needed.\n\nKim Jong Il cracked down on private wealth while enjoying a lavish private lifestyle. His khaki jumpsuits drew ridicule abroad. He also was a recluse, whose voice was broadcast only once during his 17-year rule.\n\nThese days, state propaganda highlight his son, Kim Jong Un, as a man of the people, just like his grandfather. A few months after he assumed power, state TV showed him bringing gifts and pouring drinks for families who had just moved into new apartments in Pyongyang. His wife washed dishes.\n\nKim Jong Un also moved away from his father\u2019s demands for austerity. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Instead, he resurrected a policy of his grandfather\u2019s known as the dual-track: The state would pursue both economic growth and nuclear weapons.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Kim has thousands of soldiers building recreational and housing projects in Pyongyang, which are showcased by state-run newspapers and TV as evidence of economic advancement.\n\n</span>Alongside a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and redeveloped streets in Pyongyang, known among foreigners as \u201cLittle Dubai,\u201d are new riding stables, a water park and dolphin aquarium. Visitors to the new zoo enter through a gate shaped like a giant tiger\u2019s mouth.\n\nAn analysis of state media reports on tours by North Korean leaders shows <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 20% of</span> Kim Jong Un\u2019s so-called guidance visits have been at leisure spots and construction projects, places where his father rarely appeared.\n\nDuring a visit\u2014billed as an inspection\u2014to the Pyongyang zoo this year, Mr. Kim said it would help visitors see North Korea\u2019s \u201cstrength and civilization.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">North Korean officials say these projects show that economic pressures from abroad are futile.</span> \u201dYou can see that sanctions on us have no effect,\u201d a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said in a recent interview.\n\nOutside the country, those claims draw skepticism. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Pyongyang releases no official economic statistics, but South Korea\u2019s central bank estimates that North Korea\u2019s economy grew around half a percentage point each year <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014,</span> driven mostly by mineral exports.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Two Western diplomats who recently traveled through rural North Korea on separate visits said clear signs of poverty remained.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Yet a loosening of economic restrictions appears to be raising living standards a bit, according to defectors and recent visitors.\n\n</span>Despite North Korea\u2019s longstanding ban on private enterprise, Mr. Kim has allowed some street markets and small businesses. Smartphones are hot sellers, though primarily Chinese-made models that don\u2019t connect to the internet, which is largely banned. Such illegal goods as foreign movies recorded on memory cards are also sold in markets, said Sokeel Park of the group Liberty in North Korea, a nongovernmental organization that helps defectors.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Kim Kwang-Jin, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and banker, said Mr. Kim has tolerated free-market sales as a potential source of tax income.\n\n</span>The dictator\u2019s populist image is cultivated by state media accounts of Mr. Kim getting angry with officials who, for instance, give incorrect weather forecasts or let weeds sprout through the pavement of an amusement park.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s public image of warmth toward his citizens contrasts with his ruthless elimination of potential rivals, including <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 execution</span> of his uncle, whom he called \u201cfactional filth.\u201d Mr. Kim has demoted or purged more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 top</span> officials, according to South Korean government estimates.\n\nEvan Medeiros, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House National Security Council for two years from mid-2013, said U.S. officials became increasingly persuaded of Mr. Kim\u2019s potential longevity as his rule progressed.\n\n\u201cOnce the major purges took place, we thought he was solid,\u201d said Mr. Medeiros, who is now Asia head for consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather also consolidated power through purges of potential challengers <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1953,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1956,</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1967.</span> None, however, were known to rival the execution by antiaircraft fire of a North Korean defense minister under Mr. Kim, as alleged last year by South Korea\u2019s spy agency.\n\nThe recent purges appear to pave the way for Mr. Kim to reassert the authority of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, another echo of his grandfather\u2019s. The party was used by Kim Il Sung to oversee and control his citizens and government. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">His son, Kim Jong Il, ceded more authority to the military, allowing it take over lucrative businesses in mining and foreign trade.\n\n</span>This year, at the first party congress <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 36 years</span>, Mr. Kim replaced a military-dominated governing body with one made up mostly of politicians. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the shift also puts economic management back in the hands of presumably more capable technocrats.\n\n</span>While reducing the role of the military in politics, Mr. Kim has accelerated the development of weapons of mass destruction, his grandfather\u2019s dream.\n\nKim Il Sung started North Korea\u2019s nuclear program with help from the Soviet Union. After the collapse of its former patron, the former North Korean leader agreed to a deal with the U.S. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994 that</span> froze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear work for almost a decade. It later emerged that North Korea had maintained a secret program to enrich uranium, one type of fuel for an atomic bomb.\n\nThree of North Korea\u2019s five nuclear tests have been conducted under Kim Jong Un\u2019s reign, and he has more than doubled <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 16 ballistic</span> missile tests held under his father.\n\nRecent successful tests of missiles launched from a mobile carrier and a submarine show North Korea is also gaining the capacity to hit back even if its military bases are destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s failed policy has allowed us to build a full nuclear deterrent, including counterstrike ability,\u201d the senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said.\n\nU.S. officials say they have pursued all avenues to reduce the threat from North Korea. Earlier this year, U.S. officials offered talks about ending the armed standoff on the Korean Peninsula if Pyongyang would discuss scrapping its nuclear program. The idea was rejected.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, used North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a bargaining chip for aid and security guarantees. Diplomats and experts say Mr. Kim uses the nuclear program instead to enhance his standing with the military and to intimidate South Korea, with little concern for diplomatic fallout. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Even ties with China\u2014the North\u2019s economic lifeline, defender and sole major ally\u2014have been strained by Mr. Kim\u2019s nuclear push.\n\n</span>Mr. Kim\u2019s unexpected resilience has forced Washington to recalculate the scale of the threat North Korea poses to the world, as well as U.S. responses.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The U.S. and its allies have pledged to step up economic sanctions against North Korea.</span> The U.S. has little power to directly pressure Pyongyang because it has almost no links to the isolated regime. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Efforts are instead focused on persuading countries with economic and diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The U.S. would like to reduce North Korea\u2019s export of coal and other minerals, almost all of which are sold to China.</span> Beijing, however, is strongly resistant to any action that might destabilize North Korea and send a flood of refugees over its shared border. China also sees North Korea as a strategic buffer against U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.\n\nRecent high-level defections, including the second-in-command of Pyongyang\u2019s U.K. embassy, have raised speculation of unrest among the elite. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">South Korean officials say Mr. Kim\u2019s brutality and demand for foreign currency is causing fractures.\n\n</span>A steady diet of propaganda, meanwhile, has pressed home a message that security from nuclear arms outweighs the dangers they may bring, a point of view that is apparently bolstering Mr. Kim\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cSome people in North Korea worried about war,\u201d said Choi Sul-Kyung, a 28-year-old North Korean soldier who defected last year. \u201cBut they also thought we might win.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the September<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> print edition as 'Roots Help Kim Tighten Grip in North Korea'."}, "77931": {"id": "77931", "text": "<h3>Coronavirus Symptoms and How to Protect Yourself: What We Know</h3>Coronavirus Symptoms and How to Protect Yourself: What We Know\nHealth officials are learning more about the deadly pathogen behind the continuing pandemic\nScientists and public-health officials are learning more about the new coronavirus behind a continuing pandemic. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.\nWhat are the symptoms of Covid-19?\nThe virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 114,000\n</span>- U.S. cases <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passes 22,000\n</span>- What we know about the coronavirus\nSome people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don\u2019t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:\n\u2022 Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath\n\u2022 Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u2022 Bluish lips or face\nWhat should I do if I develop symptoms?\nIf you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.\nIsolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.\nHow worried should I be?\nMost people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But \u201cmild\u201d can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you\u2019ll have to be isolated or quarantined.\nBy not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.\nPublic-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn\u2019t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren\u2019t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.\nI\u2019m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?\nThe new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.\nIs taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?\nExperts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn\u2019t a cure and won\u2019t prevent you from infecting others.\nI\u2019ve heard I shouldn\u2019t take ibuprofen. Is that true?\nThere have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn\u2019t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn\u2019t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.\nIs there a test?\nYes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.\nBlood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.\nWhat if I have to self-isolate?\nIf you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don\u2019t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.\nDon\u2019t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.\nAre there drugs to treat coronaviruses?\nThere aren\u2019t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.\u2019s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.\nTwo clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.\nHow do I keep from getting Covid-19?\nSchools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending\u2014and in some cases, requiring\u2014that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.\nWho is most at risk?\nAdults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 8% in</span> people <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 70 to</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 79,</span> compared with <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.\nAre my children at risk?\nFew children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 and</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.\nHow at risk is someone in the U.S.?\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.\nThe number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.\nPublic-health officials hope to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That\u2019s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.\nCoronaviruses: From Animals to Humans\nResearchers aren't sure how the novel coronavirus first infected people in China, but the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, which originated in bats, provide clues.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n2\n1</span></span></span>\nProteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the host\u2019s respiratory tract.

The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person\u2019s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nRespiratory droplets are heavy and don\u2019t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.\nScientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.\nHow long can the virus survive on surfaces?\nIt can last up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.\nThe study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.\nWipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.\nCan face masks protect you?\nHealth experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings\u2014even a bandanna or scarf will do\u2014in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.\nCloth masks or coverings don\u2019t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren\u2019t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn\u2019t be used on children <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.\nWhat else can I do to protect myself?\nThe most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth\u2014viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.\nIs it safe to travel internationally?\nThe State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.\nCan I donate blood?\nThe CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. \u201cSocial distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,\u201d said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\nTo minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.\nGoing back to basics: What is a coronavirus?\nThis virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.\nSeven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\nThis new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)\nHow deadly is it?\nThe overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won\u2019t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.\nThe mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.\nThe overall mortality rate may be less <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.\nThat is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 0.1%.</span>\nCovid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen\u2014SARS, which erupted in China <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.\nBut this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.\nHow Effective Are Masks?\nThe World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.\nAirborne\nLarge droplets\nSurgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n39.9</span></span></span></span>\u201d\nApprox. distance\nlarge droplets can travel\nSmall droplets\nThese traditional masks are less effective with small droplets, as they can travel farther and in unpredictable paths affected by wind and other gusts.

They don\u2019t fully seal off the nose and mouth.\nN95 masks offer more protection. But they only work if they fit properly, and aren\u2019t suitable for children or people with facial hair.\nHow easily does the virus spread?\nDisease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.5 and</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 other</span> people.\nPublic-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nExperts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.\nWhat is the incubation period?\nPeople become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 11.5 days</span>.\nCan you get infected after you have already had the disease?\nThat isn\u2019t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.\nCan you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?\nSeveral studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance\u20146 feet or more\u2014from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.\nWhere did the new coronavirus come from?\nThe new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn\u2019t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have questions about the risk of the new coronavirus from China?

The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.\nWhat are the symptoms of Covid-19?\nThe virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 114,000\n</span>- U.S. cases <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passes 22,000\n</span>- What we know about the coronavirus\nSome people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don\u2019t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:\n\u2022 Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath\n\u2022 Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u2022 Bluish lips or face\nWhat should I do if I develop symptoms?\nIf you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.\nIsolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.\nHow worried should I be?\nMost people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But \u201cmild\u201d can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you\u2019ll have to be isolated or quarantined.\nBy not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.\nPublic-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn\u2019t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren\u2019t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.\nI\u2019m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?\nThe new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.\nIs taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?\nExperts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn\u2019t a cure and won\u2019t prevent you from infecting others.\nI\u2019ve heard I shouldn\u2019t take ibuprofen. Is that true?\nThere have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn\u2019t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn\u2019t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.\nIs there a test?\nYes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.\nBlood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.\nWhat if I have to self-isolate?\nIf you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don\u2019t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.\nDon\u2019t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.\nAre there drugs to treat coronaviruses?\nThere aren\u2019t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.\u2019s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.\nTwo clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.\nHow do I keep from getting Covid-19?\nSchools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending\u2014and in some cases, requiring\u2014that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.\nWho is most at risk?\nAdults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 8% in</span> people <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 70 to</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 79,</span> compared with <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.\nAre my children at risk?\nFew children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 and</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.\nHow at risk is someone in the U.S.?\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.\nThe number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.\nPublic-health officials hope to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That\u2019s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.\nCoronaviruses: From Animals to Humans\nResearchers aren't sure how the novel coronavirus first infected people in China, but the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, which originated in bats, provide clues.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n2\n1</span></span></span>\nProteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the host\u2019s respiratory tract.

The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person\u2019s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nRespiratory droplets are heavy and don\u2019t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.\nScientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.\nHow long can the virus survive on surfaces?\nIt can last up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.\nThe study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.\nWipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.\nCan face masks protect you?\nHealth experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings\u2014even a bandanna or scarf will do\u2014in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.\nCloth masks or coverings don\u2019t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren\u2019t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn\u2019t be used on children <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.\nWhat else can I do to protect myself?\nThe most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth\u2014viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.\nIs it safe to travel internationally?\nThe State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.\nCan I donate blood?\nThe CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. \u201cSocial distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,\u201d said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\nTo minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.\nGoing back to basics: What is a coronavirus?\nThis virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.\nSeven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\nThis new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)\nHow deadly is it?\nThe overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won\u2019t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.\nThe mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.\nThe overall mortality rate may be less <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.\nThat is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 0.1%.</span>\nCovid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen\u2014SARS, which erupted in China <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.\nBut this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.\nHow Effective Are Masks?\nThe World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.\nAirborne\nLarge droplets\nSurgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n39.9</span></span></span></span>\u201d\nApprox. distance\nlarge droplets can travel\nSmall droplets\nThese traditional masks are less effective with small droplets, as they can travel farther and in unpredictable paths affected by wind and other gusts.

But they only work if they fit properly, and aren\u2019t suitable for children or people with facial hair.\nHow easily does the virus spread?\nDisease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.5 and</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 other</span> people.\nPublic-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nExperts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.\nWhat is the incubation period?\nPeople become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 11.5 days</span>.\nCan you get infected after you have already had the disease?\nThat isn\u2019t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.\nCan you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?\nSeveral studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance\u20146 feet or more\u2014from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.\nWhere did the new coronavirus come from?\nThe new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn\u2019t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have questions about the risk of the new coronavirus from China?

The C.D.C. director overruled her own advisers and recommended Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for health care workers and others at risk.\nWar-torn Yemen, where the overwhelming majority of the population is unvaccinated, is seeing coronavirus cases multiply and deaths soar, according to a report this week by the British charity Oxfam.\nOxfam found that Covid deaths had increased by more than fivefold in the past month and that recorded Covid cases had tripled. The charity said actual figures were likely to be much higher, with many unregistered cases and deaths.\nThe official Covid death toll <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1,658,</span> and recorded cases have <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 8,789.</span> But the situation in the country of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 million</span> is hard to gauge. \u201cCountless\u201d others have died in their homes or have not been diagnosed because of scarce tests and hospital beds, Oxfam said.\nYemen is still embroiled in a war that began <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 when</span> Iran-backed rebels know as the Houthis seized the country\u2019s northwest, including the capital, Sana, sending the government into exile. The government has effectively collapsed, and tens of thousands have died.\nThe country already faced many health challenges before the coronavirus emerged. Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.\nThe pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.\n\u201cCovid has made life even worse for people across the country,\u201d Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam\u2019s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.\nSome relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.\nThe country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.\n</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.\nIn shelters that host <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.\n\u201cThe country is not able to cope with another health crisis,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received. The health care system is dangerously underfunded, working with <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 11 percent</span> of what it needs, the organization says.\nSome had hoped that the pandemic would force Yemen\u2019s warring parties into a truce, but the war continues.\n\u201cIf anything, it is amazing how little the pandemic has affected the fighting,\u201d said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst on Yemen for the International Crisis Group, in an interview.\nThe terror and uncertainty of the war, which has forced people to deal with loss on a daily basis for years, remains a larger concern for many Yemenis than the pandemic itself. \u201cThis speaks to the trauma of the conflict,\u201d Mr. Salisbury said.\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Sept. 23||14-day change|\n|New cases||126,760||\u201314%|\n|New deaths||2,036||+29%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Sept. 23||14-day change|\n|New cases||506,623||\u201313%|\n|New deaths||8,357||\u20139%|\nAlaska, once a leader in vaccinating its citizens, is now in the throes of its worst coronavirus surge of the pandemic, as the Delta variant rips through the state, swamping hospitals with patients.\nAs of Thursday, the state was <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averaging 125 new</span> cases a day for <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">every 100,000 people</span>, more than any other in the nation, according to recent data trends collected by The New York Times. That figure has shot up <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.\nOn Wednesday, the state said it had activated \u201ccrisis standards of care,\u201d giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.\nGov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.\nJared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge \u201ccrippling\u201d in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.\n\u201cWe are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Kosin said.\nCritically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\u201cUnlike in the <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lower 48,</span> you don\u2019t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,\u201d said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.\nMr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,\u201d he said.\nAlaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.\nDr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,\u201d Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.\nOn the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.\nThe state\u2019s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country\u2019s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.\nAdvertisement\nThe C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency\u2019s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s endorsements over her own agency\u2019s advisers.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision was a boost for President Biden\u2019s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters.

Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.\nThe pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.\n\u201cCovid has made life even worse for people across the country,\u201d Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam\u2019s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.\nSome relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.\nThe country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.\n</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.\nIn shelters that host <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.\n\u201cThe country is not able to cope with another health crisis,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received.

Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said.

He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said.

In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.\n\nTherefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.\n\nSo while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.\n\nOn <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" McCain had <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.\n\nTrump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 298 charities</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2009 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.\n\nIn other words, \"leading\" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:\n\nWounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.\n\nAfter this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $57,000 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.\n\nSo I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly \"imitated\" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.\n\nThough Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.\n\nNot convinced? You decide:\n\nFor any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?\n\nAP Photo/Andrew <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Harnik\n\n3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.\n\nTrump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**.\" Granted, that was <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.\n\nAnd while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had \"the Face of a Dog,\" calling a lawyer \"disgusting\" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.\n\n\"I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\"\n\nThis is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, \"If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\"\n\nAny self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?\n\nIt is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).\n\nLast year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.\n\nMany, as a result, have accused him of being a \"racist.\" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.\n\nPerhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.\n\n</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.\n\nBut if that label of \"racism\" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:\n\na person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is \"bigot.\"\n\nAs Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, \"It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.\"\n\nAs a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.\n\nIn the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.\n\nHe previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as \"incompetent.\"</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is \"the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.\"\n\nHe once said he was \"very pro-choice\" and now he says he is \"very pro-life.\" <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Up <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\n</span>\"In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nJust on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.\n\n</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.\n\nMany Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.\n\nTrump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.\n\nIn your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.\n\nThere was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.\n\nYes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians;\" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an \"active member\" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a \"Christian\") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.\n\nAdd in his questionable moral behaviors, his \"love of money,\" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.\n\nFor many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?\n\nIn addition,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a \"huckster\" and a \"menace to American conservatism.\"\n\nAnd as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).\n\nWe promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.\n\nIt's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.\n\nHIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.\n\nAs writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:\n\nBullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors\" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.\n\nMany mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.\n\nAs clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, \"To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.\"\n\nNarcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, \"Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nMichaelis adds, \"He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.\"\n\nSo why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?\n\nOf course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...\n\n...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).\n\nTrump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama \"led the way.\"\n\nHe has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.\n\nPhoto by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nBut what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?\n\nAnd in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.\n\nFurthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:\n\n\"We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.\"\n\nIn regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, \"Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.\"\n\nNow if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?\n\n\"First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\"\n\nIn terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.\n\nRecently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.\n\nFirst, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?\n\nSecond, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\n\nThird, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?\n\nFourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?\n\nWill he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?\n\nTrump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:\n\n9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).\n\nEarly on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton \"plant\" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.\n\nTrump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.\n\nAs to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.\n\nIf the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).\n\nMy vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.\n\nOr...\n\n9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to \"make America great again,\" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your \"momma\" or \"daddy\" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.\n\nSo far Trump's demonstration of \"great\" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.\n\nMany conservatives themselves, including \"Tea Party\" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.\n\nAnd yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.\n\nRemember, the Donald is playing \"nice\" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 </span>(that's pronounced \"first Samuel eight\"), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.\n\n</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:\n\nNot since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.\n\nBut it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?\n\nNow if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.\n\n\"It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?\"\n\nBut when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.\n\nBut if not then, well, I've already listed it.\n\nThe question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?\n\nAmerica is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.\n\nAmerica is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.\n\nAmerica is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.\n\nIn some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.\n\nBut in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?\n\nIf Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.\n\nIf that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.\n\nSo the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?\n\nI guess we'll start to get a picture soon, beginning <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Feb 1.</span>\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on HonestlyThinking.org.", "displayed_text": "<h3>To Trump Supporters, Here Are 9 Things This Conservative Assumes About You</h3>Dear Trump Supporter,\n\nLet me start by saying that I get it. I get the frustration.\n\nI, too, am tired of all the PC language that has dominated our culture. I'm tired of having to be careful about everything (and I mean everything) I say for fear of accidentally offending someone and dealing with hyped up repercussions.\n\nI, too, am sickened with politics as usual -- with a stagnant, do-nothing government. I'm tired of unmet promises and of wimpy politicians who won't stand up for what is right and what needs to be done.\n\nI, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again.\n\nSo I get it.\n\nI get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Why wouldn't we want an accomplished businessman to run the \"business\" of the states?</span> Why wouldn't we want a person who could not care less what people think to break through the barriers of our hypersensitive speech? Why wouldn't we root for someone radically different than what we've seen before in Washington, who promises to get stuff done, while at the same time makes us laugh?\n\nBut this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.\n\nFor the Donald has said and done a number of things that many analysts have stated should have knocked him out of the race. But rather than causing him to lose ground with you, you have stood faithful. In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.\n\nTherefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.\n\nSo while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.\n\nOn <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" McCain had <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.\n\nTrump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 298 charities</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2009 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.\n\nIn other words, \"leading\" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:\n\nWounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.\n\nAfter this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $57,000 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.\n\nSo I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly \"imitated\" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.\n\nThough Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.\n\nNot convinced? You decide:\n\nFor any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?\n\nAP Photo/Andrew <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Harnik\n\n3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.\n\nTrump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**.\" Granted, that was <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.\n\nAnd while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had \"the Face of a Dog,\" calling a lawyer \"disgusting\" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.\n\n\"I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\"\n\nThis is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, \"If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\"\n\nAny self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?\n\nIt is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).\n\nLast year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.\n\nMany, as a result, have accused him of being a \"racist.\" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.\n\nPerhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.\n\n</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.\n\nBut if that label of \"racism\" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:\n\na person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is \"bigot.\"\n\nAs Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, \"It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.\"\n\nAs a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.\n\nIn the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.\n\nHe previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as \"incompetent.\"</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is \"the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.\"\n\nHe once said he was \"very pro-choice\" and now he says he is \"very pro-life.\" <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Up <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\n</span>\"In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nJust on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.\n\n</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.\n\nMany Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.\n\nTrump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.\n\nIn your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.\n\nThere was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.\n\nYes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians;\" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an \"active member\" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a \"Christian\") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.\n\nAdd in his questionable moral behaviors, his \"love of money,\" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.\n\nFor many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?\n\nIn addition,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a \"huckster\" and a \"menace to American conservatism.\"\n\nAnd as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).\n\nWe promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.\n\nIt's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.\n\nHIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.\n\nAs writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:\n\nBullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors\" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.\n\nMany mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.\n\nAs clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, \"To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.\"\n\nNarcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, \"Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nMichaelis adds, \"He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.\"\n\nSo why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?\n\nOf course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...\n\n...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).\n\nTrump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama \"led the way.\"\n\nHe has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.\n\nPhoto by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nBut what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?\n\nAnd in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.\n\nFurthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:\n\n\"We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.\"\n\nIn regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, \"Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.\"\n\nNow if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?\n\n\"First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\"\n\nIn terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.\n\nRecently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.\n\nFirst, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?\n\nSecond, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\n\nThird, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?\n\nFourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?\n\nWill he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?\n\nTrump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:\n\n9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).\n\nEarly on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton \"plant\" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.\n\nTrump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.\n\nAs to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.\n\nIf the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).\n\nMy vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.\n\nOr...\n\n9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to \"make America great again,\" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your \"momma\" or \"daddy\" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.\n\nSo far Trump's demonstration of \"great\" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.\n\nMany conservatives themselves, including \"Tea Party\" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.\n\nAnd yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.\n\nRemember, the Donald is playing \"nice\" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 </span>(that's pronounced \"first Samuel eight\"), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.\n\n</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:\n\nNot since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.\n\nBut it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?\n\nNow if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.\n\n\"It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?\"\n\nBut when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.\n\nBut if not then, well, I've already listed it.\n\nThe question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?\n\nAmerica is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.\n\nAmerica is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.\n\nAmerica is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.\n\nIn some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.\n\nBut in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?\n\nIf Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.\n\nIf that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.\n\nSo the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?\n\nI guess we'll start to get a picture soon, beginning <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Feb 1.</span>\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on HonestlyThinking.org."}, "72580": {"id": "72580", "text": "<h3>Pound Plunges on U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">All asset classes down as final result of referendum is announced\n\nUpdated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 24,</span></span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 2</span>:32 am ET\n\nBritain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union battered the British pound by more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11% Thursday</span> night and into Friday morning, pushed down stocks in Asia and pointed to a day of steep falls across the world\u2019s financial markets.</span> It was a brutal drubbing for investors who had stacked up bets that the U.K. would choose to stay.\n\nThe pound traded as low <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $1.3230 in</span> London\u2019s early hours, as a pink-fringed dawn rose over the city and the British Broadcasting Corp. called the referendum for Leave. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">That was the lowest level against the dollar <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1985,</span> and an epic move for a developed-market currency.</span> The pound edged back up and was <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $1.36 by</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7 a</span>.m.
