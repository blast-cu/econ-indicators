Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Starbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market\u2014the U.S.\u2014for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5%.</span>\n\n</span>Mr. Schultz said the company\u2019s plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries.</span> \u201cThey never protected themselves on the high end,\u201d he said of beer companies. \u201cI think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.\n\nMillennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Between 2008 and</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 36% from</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13%,</span> while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 41% from</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19%,</span> according to the National Coffee Association.\n\nConsumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers\u2019 names was an average <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $9.95 higher</span> per pound than those that didn\u2019t, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Andrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 7% to</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8% annually</span>, compared <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 1% to</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2% for</span> all coffee.\n\n</span>Starbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald\u2019s Corp., Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc.\u2019s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee and espresso drinks on the cheap.\n\n</span>\u201cIn coffee you have to pick a path,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst Jason West.\n\nStill, the only proof of the new Starbucks concept is the Seattle Roastery, a store it opened two years ago. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Sales there are <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 24% from</span> a year ago and the average check is four times that of a traditional Starbucks.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Brooke de Boutray, managing director and portfolio manager at Seattle investment firm Zevenbergen Capital, said the questions being asked now\u2014whether the Roastery model can be replicated and whether people will really shell <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">out $6 to</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $12 for</span> coffee\u2014are the same ones people asked when Starbucks went public <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 and</span> its coffees ranged in price <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 65 cents</span> for drip coffee <span id=\"51\"

Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Starbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market\u2014the U.S.\u2014for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5%.</span>\n\n</span>Mr. Schultz said the company\u2019s plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries.</span> \u201cThey never protected themselves on the high end,\u201d he said of beer companies. \u201cI think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.\n\nMillennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Between 2008 and</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span> the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 36% from</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13%,</span> while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 41% from</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19%,</span> according to the National Coffee Association.\n\nConsumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers\u2019 names was an average <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $9.95 higher</span> per pound than those that didn\u2019t, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Andrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 7% to</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8% annually</span>, compared <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 1% to</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2% for</span> all coffee.\n\n</span>Starbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald\u2019s Corp., Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc.\u2019s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee and espresso drinks on the cheap.\n\n</span>\u201cIn coffee you have to pick a path,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst Jason West.\n\nStill, the only proof of the new Starbucks concept is the Seattle Roastery, a store it opened two years ago. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Sales there are <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 24% from</span> a year ago and the average check is four times that of a traditional Starbucks.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Brooke de Boutray, managing director and portfolio manager at Seattle investment firm Zevenbergen Capital, said the questions being asked now\u2014whether the Roastery model can be replicated and whether people will really shell <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">out $6

\u201cthe biggest trade deal in the United States\u2019 history\u201d \u2014 one that would return lost manufacturing jobs to American shores, discourage future outsourcing of factory work, and \u201csend cash and jobs pouring into the United States.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But many economists and trade experts say the president\u2019s forecast may prove overly optimistic,

fare better than others, the sheer size of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $20 trillion</span> U.S. economy will probably swamp those specific effects.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The accord, which the president has christened the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would require automobiles to include more North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment, pry open a sliver of Canada\u2019s dairy market and update trading rules for the Internet economy.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">[Trump says trade deal proves tough

professional economists.\n</span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolutionary deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s a modification of a deal already in place,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior U.S.

expect it to boost the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">To the degree that it could drive growth, the deal would do so by removing the cloud of uncertainty that Trump has created by unsettling global trade, some economists said.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That climate of doubt may have held back investments \u2014 so the new deal could perhaps add a tenth of a percentage point to the economy\u2019s growth rate next year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n</span>\u201cWe see this rebranded NAFTA agreement as a marketing exercise,\u201d Rupkey said. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe harsh war of words from Trump\u2019s economics team terrified markets, consumers and businesses for a time, but what the U.S.

Trump casts his new North American trade agreement as \u201cthe biggest trade deal in the United States\u2019 history\u201d \u2014 one that would return lost manufacturing jobs to American shores, discourage future outsourcing of factory work, and \u201csend cash and jobs pouring into the United States.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But many economists and trade experts say the president\u2019s forecast may prove overly optimistic, given the limited changes that are envisioned and the powerful economic forces that already have reshaped regional commerce.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While some industries and regions would fare better than others, the sheer size of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $20 trillion</span> U.S. economy will probably swamp those specific effects.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The accord, which the president has christened the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would require automobiles to include more North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment, pry open a sliver of Canada\u2019s dairy market and update trading rules for the Internet economy.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">[Trump says trade deal proves tough talk and tariffs work]\nAll that earned the administration wary praise Monday from business groups, farmers, investors and even some Democratic lawmakers.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But the president\u2019s ebullience about \u201chigh-quality American jobs\u201d ushering in \u201ca new dawn for the American auto industry\u201d stood in contrast to the relatively muted assessments of professional economists.\n</span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolutionary deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s a modification of a deal already in place,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, an investment and research firm.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe total economic impact will be very small.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">I do not expect it to boost the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">To the degree that it could drive growth, the deal would do so by removing the cloud of uncertainty that Trump has created by unsettling global trade, some economists said.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">That climate of doubt may have held back investments \u2014 so the new deal could perhaps add a tenth of a percentage point to the economy\u2019s growth rate next year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n</span>\u201cWe see this rebranded NAFTA agreement as a marketing exercise,\u201d Rupkey said. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe harsh war of words from Trump\u2019s economics team terrified markets, consumers

American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That was up <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,\u201d Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cService inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,\u201d James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n- Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors\u2019 expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed\u2019s next increase in interest rates, <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.25 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.72

American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That was up <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,\u201d Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cService inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,\u201d James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n- Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up

Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California\u2019s most influential players \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.\nBut not Karen Bass.\nNewly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201c\u2018I guess you probably don\u2019t want to be doing business here,\u2019\u201d the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do. And that was right. I didn\u2019t want to be in the tent.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation\u2019s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.\n</span>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d she said.\nToday Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-\u2019em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who \u2014 like the men in that tent in Sacramento \u2014 are now trying to figure out what to make of her.\nAnd of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden \u2014 in the story of her life and the story of her politics \u2014 as the Democratic congresswoman from California.\nMs. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.\nMs. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One of Ms. Bass\u2019s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.\n</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.\n[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]\nIn many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party\u2019s candidate for vice president.

Mondale as his running mate <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976.</span>\nBut her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.\nIn the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that \u201cthe passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.\u201d Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.\nMs. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro \u201cComandante en Jefe,\u201d a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do that again,\u201d she said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cTalked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn\u2019t have been said.\u201d\nShe said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,\u201d she said.\nChapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.\nIn one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, \u201cJust so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.\u201d\nBack in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office \u2014 not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.\nAnd certainly not for vice president.\n\u201cOh God, no!\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.\u201d\nAs Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.\n\u201cWhen a woman is in a role that\u2019s new, people underestimate,\u201d she said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?\u201d\n\u2018I felt like I had failed a generation\u2019\nAs she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.\nAfter graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.\nWhile elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis \u2014 hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.\n\u201cWhat she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people \u2014 she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,\u201d said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.\nWhat made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.\nFor young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don\u2019t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.\nAt the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991.</span>\nMs. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change \u2014 \u201cfinally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,\u201d she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.\n\u201cI felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn\u2019t gotten change,\u201d she said.\nIn the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.\nOne of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.\n\u201cThe crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,\u201d said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass\u2019s. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cShe knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.\u201d\nMs. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city \u2014 drugs, crime, poverty \u2014 in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.\n</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.\nThen, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly.

People don\u2019t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don\u2019t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn\u2019t ask to be a part of.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state\u2019s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,\u201d said Michael C.

P\u00e9rez, who succeeded Ms. Bass as speaker, said the dynamic of a minority party holding the votes needed to pass legislation greatly complicated her negotiations with the Senate and governor.\n\u201cBut then she had the hard work of delivering the votes in the caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody goes to office to make cuts on programs they hold near and dear.\u201d\nAntonio R. Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.\n\u201cI thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s unabashedly a progressive, but she\u2019s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.\u201d\nIt was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden \u2014 the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.\n\u201cI would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,\u201d said Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. \u201cShe was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.\n\u201cShe used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. \u201c\u2018Gotta go to Gitmo.\u2019\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.\n</span>\u201cShe was unflappable,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cIt was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.\u201d\nMs. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.\n\u201cIt was very devastating personally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.\u201d\nAs Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today\u2019s brutal political environment?\nThe No.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.\nThat said, Ms. Bass\u2019s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.\n\u201cPeople use the word nice about her, if you notice,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cBut I think a better word is \u2014 she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.\u201d\nMs. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice \u201cas opposed to mean\u201d and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, \u201cNice doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>From Outsider to Insider: Karen Bass\u2019s Unexpected Journey to Power</h3>LOS ANGELES \u2014 <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> as California confronted its most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression, the center of power in the state capital was a tent.</span> It was set up in the courtyard outside the office of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California\u2019s most influential players \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.\nBut not Karen Bass.\nNewly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201c\u2018I guess you probably don\u2019t want to be doing business here,\u2019\u201d the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do. And that was right. I didn\u2019t want to be in the tent.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation\u2019s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.\n</span>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d she said.\nToday Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-\u2019em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who \u2014 like the men in that tent in Sacramento \u2014 are now trying to figure out what to make of her.\nAnd of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden \u2014 in the story of her life and the story of her politics \u2014 as the Democratic congresswoman from California.\nMs. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.\nMs. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One of Ms. Bass\u2019s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.\n</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.\n[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]\nIn many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party\u2019s candidate for vice president.

Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.\n\u201cI thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s unabashedly a progressive, but she\u2019s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.\u201d\nIt was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden \u2014 the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.\n\u201cI would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,\u201d said Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. \u201cShe was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.\n\u201cShe used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. \u201c\u2018Gotta go to Gitmo.\u2019\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.\n</span>\u201cShe was unflappable,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cIt was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.\u201d\nMs. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.\n\u201cIt was very devastating personally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.\u201d\nAs Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today\u2019s brutal political environment?\nThe No.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.\nThat said, Ms. Bass\u2019s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.\n\u201cPeople use the word nice about her, if you notice,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cBut I think a better word is \u2014 she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.\u201d\nMs. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice \u201cas opposed to mean\u201d and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, \u201cNice doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d"}, "2657": {"id": "2657", "text": "<h3>A Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs: 12 Tales of Pandemic Resilience</h3>Advertisement\nSupported by\nA Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience\nThe virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.\nAs much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience \u2014 of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.\nBRAZIL\n\u201cI am yearning for your hug. . .\u201d\n. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.\nThey had <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.\nStudents with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.\nBut the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.\nYasmim Vit\u00f3ria de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful and she lets us have fun,\u201d the 9-year-old said.\nMs. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.\n\u201cIn a moment of tragedy, we\u2019ve been able to share moments of love,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThat is very powerful \u2014 Ernesto Londo\u00f1o and Manuela Andreoni\nINDIA\nWhen India\u2019s lockdown hit . . .\n. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.\n\u201cWho else would take care of them?\u201d he said. \u2014 Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj\nITALY\nWhen an Italian bookstore appealed . . .\n. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.\n\u201cWe wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,\u201d said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.\nThe idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers \u2014 and with luck a few volunteers \u2014 would read to people for <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. \u201cWe were thinking small,\u201d she said.\nBut the response was overwhelming.\nAfter the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.\nFor good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">children<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.\nSome of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.\nBut Mr. Asadi,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,</span> has <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.\nThen, the coronavirus came to Britain.\nWith older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard\u2019s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.\nFor a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because I live alone,\u201d he said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd you get fed up with your own company.\u201d\n</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.\nThen, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.\n\u201cI was most surprised,\u201d he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">day 1 of</span> Britain\u2019s mass inoculation program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.\u201d\nMr. Pollard\u2019s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. \u201cHonestly, he\u2019s my hero, nobody believes he\u2019<span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 90,</span>\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just genuinely so kindhearted.\u201d\nNow, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy \u2014 to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family\n\u201cThe worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,\u201d Mr. Pollard said.\nNow, at least for him, it has. \u2014 Megan Specia\nAdvertisement", "displayed_text": "<h3>A Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs: 12 Tales of Pandemic Resilience</h3>Advertisement\nSupported by\nA Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience\nThe virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.\nAs much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience \u2014 of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.\nBRAZIL\n\u201cI am yearning for your hug. . .\u201d\n. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.\nThey had <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.\nStudents with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.\nBut the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.\nYasmim Vit\u00f3ria de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful and she lets us have fun,\u201d the 9-year-old said.\nMs. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.\n\u201cIn a moment of tragedy, we\u2019ve been able to share moments of love,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThat is very powerful \u2014 Ernesto Londo\u00f1o and Manuela Andreoni\nINDIA\nWhen India\u2019s lockdown hit . . .\n. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.\n\u201cWho else would take care of them?\u201d he said. \u2014 Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj\nITALY\nWhen an Italian bookstore appealed . . .\n. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.\n\u201cWe wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,\u201d said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.\nThe idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers \u2014 and with luck a few volunteers \u2014 would read to people for <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. \u201cWe were thinking small,\u201d she said.\nBut the response was overwhelming.\nAfter the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.\nFor good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">children<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.\nSome of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.\nBut Mr. Asadi,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,</span> has <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.\nThen, the coronavirus came to Britain.\nWith older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard\u2019s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.\nFor a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because I live alone,\u201d he said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd you get fed up with your own company.\u201d\n</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.\nThen, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.\n\u201cI was most surprised,\u201d he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">day 1 of</span> Britain\u2019s mass inoculation program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.\u201d\nMr. Pollard\u2019s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. \u201cHonestly, he\u2019s my hero, nobody believes he\u2019<span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 90,</span>\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just genuinely so kindhearted.\u201d\nNow, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy \u2014 to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family\n\u201cThe worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,\u201d Mr. Pollard

communities that are dependent on oil and gas.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, is giving special attention to loans in metropolitan areas where more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3% of</span> jobs are directly tied to energy production, Mr. Shrewsberry said.\n\n</span>The bank\u2019s shares fell <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 0.7% on</span> the day.\n\nDespite the improved performance of the bank\u2019s holdings of residential mortgages, a worsening of loans to energy companies prompted the bank to hold steady the amount that it had previously set aside to cover losses. The bank <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">released $300 million</span> from those funds in the third quarter a year ago. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">That amount would have increased the firm\u2019s income before taxes by more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3% in</span> the third quarter.\n\n</span>Releasing loan-loss reserves has consistently helped boost Wells Fargo\u2019s bottom line in recent years. The third quarter was the first time since <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2010 that</span> it didn\u2019t get a lift from a release. Banks typically release reserves when they view credit quality on their loans improving. Loan charge-offs in the bank\u2019s commercial-and-industrial-loan portfolio, which includes energy exposure, roughly doubled <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $122 million</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $67 million</span> a year earlier.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">James Abate, chief investment officer of New York-based Centre Asset Management LLC, said he is concerned the financial industry is underestimating the woes in the energy sector given potential \u201cspillover effects.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In addition to those concerns, Mr. Abate said his firm, which owns <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 155,000 shares</span> of Wells Fargo, plans to continue reducing its financial-stock exposure due to low rates and a flattening yield curve.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He also wasn\u2019t impressed with Wells Fargo\u2019s quarterly return on equity, return on assets and net-interest margins, three closely watched profitability metrics that all declined for the bank in the third quarter.\n\n</span>\u201cThe results were unequivocally bad in terms of performance,\u201d he said.\n\nWells Fargo executives said Wednesday that the bank\u2019s profitability is still better than peers. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The firm reported its net interest margin, a measure of how profitably it can lend out its customers\u2019 deposits, fell <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2.96% from</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2.97% at</span> the end of June <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 3.06% in</span> the third quarter a year ago.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">That margin has been challenged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates low, a policy that Wells Fargo executives said would continue for longer than the industry had previously expected.\n\n</span>In light of that forecast, the bank said it would continue repositioning some of its balance sheet. Wells Fargo invested in more longer-dated bonds and noted that some of the assets in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $32 billion</span> commercial-lending-and-leasing businesses it recently said it would purchase from General Electric Co. had the extra benefit of paying off while rates were low.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s overall loan activity picked up during the quarter, despite the concerns in oil and gas. Total loans at the end of the quarter <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $903.23 billion</span>, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7.7% increase</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $838.88 billion</span> in the same period a year ago.\n\nMr. Shrewsberry said in an interview that the act of reducing credit to indebted energy companies is \u201cpart of the healing mechanism\u201d as they repair balance sheets. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He added that he thinks this period would be different than other cycles when energy prices slumped because most bank loans are now secured by energy reserves.</span> Additionally, banks will be repaid in front of other unsecured bondholders.\n\nSome of Wells Fargo\u2019s clients in the energy sector have disclosed lately that their lenders have reduced their borrowing limits and tightened their grip on collateral. Emerald Oil Inc., which produces oil in North Dakota and Montana, said late Monday that Wells Fargo and other lenders reduced credit available to the company <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 40% to</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $120 million</span>. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That was less than the amount that Emerald had already borrowed, forcing the company to look for alternative financing to cover the difference.\n\n</span>Chesapeake Energy Corp. said late last month that its lenders, including Wells Fargo, tied <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $4 billion</span> credit facility to its untapped oil and gas reserves after years being able to borrow the same amount on an unsecured basis.

Loan charge-offs in the bank\u2019s commercial-and-industrial-loan portfolio, which includes energy exposure, roughly doubled <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $122 million</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $67 million</span> a year earlier.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">James Abate, chief investment officer of New York-based Centre Asset Management LLC, said he is concerned the financial industry is underestimating the woes in the energy sector given potential \u201cspillover effects.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In addition to those concerns, Mr. Abate said his firm, which owns <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 155,000 shares</span> of Wells Fargo, plans to continue reducing its financial-stock exposure due to low rates and a flattening yield curve.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He also wasn\u2019t impressed with Wells Fargo\u2019s quarterly return on equity, return on assets and net-interest margins, three closely watched profitability metrics that all declined for the bank in the third quarter.\n\n</span>\u201cThe results were unequivocally bad in terms of performance,\u201d he said.\n\nWells Fargo executives said Wednesday that the bank\u2019s profitability is still better than peers. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The firm reported its net interest margin, a measure of how profitably it can lend out its customers\u2019 deposits, fell <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2.96% from</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2.97% at</span> the end of June <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 3.06% in</span> the third quarter a year ago.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">That margin has been challenged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates low, a policy that Wells Fargo executives said would continue for longer than the industry had previously expected.\n\n</span>In light of that forecast, the bank said it would continue repositioning some of its balance sheet. Wells Fargo invested in more longer-dated bonds and noted that some of the assets in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $32 billion</span> commercial-lending-and-leasing businesses it recently said it would purchase from General Electric Co. had the extra benefit of paying off while rates were low.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s overall loan activity picked up during the quarter, despite the concerns in oil and gas. Total loans at the end of the quarter <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $903.23 billion</span>, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7.7% increase</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $838.88 billion</span> in the same period a year ago.\n\nMr. Shrewsberry said in an interview that the act of reducing credit to indebted energy companies is \u201cpart of the healing mechanism\u201d as they repair balance sheets. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He added that he thinks this period would be different than other cycles when energy prices slumped because most bank loans are now secured by energy reserves.</span> Additionally, banks will be repaid in front of other unsecured bondholders.\n\nSome of Wells Fargo\u2019s clients in the energy sector have disclosed lately that their lenders have reduced their borrowing limits and tightened their grip on collateral. Emerald Oil Inc., which produces oil in North Dakota and Montana, said late Monday that Wells Fargo and other lenders reduced credit available to the company <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 40% to</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $120 million</span>. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That was less than the amount that Emerald had already borrowed, forcing the company to look for alternative financing to cover the difference.\n\n</span>Chesapeake Energy Corp. said late last month that its lenders, including Wells Fargo, tied <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $4 billion</span> credit facility to its untapped oil and gas reserves after years being able to borrow the same amount on an unsecured basis. Representatives of the firms couldn\u2019t be reached for immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Peter Rudegeair at Peter.

It takes four days and <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs $3,000 to</span> print a 3-D prototype of an engine's air intake manifold, compared to four months <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $500,000 without</span> 3-D printing. Prototyped parts with 3-D printing can be easily enlarged or reduced by fractions of an inch and printed again.\n\n\"You're offering engineers a lot more flexibility\" with their component designs, said Harold Sears, additive manufacturing specialist at Ford. Printers can't yet produce finished parts in large enough volumes to install in cars and light trucks.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">3-D is making inroads in the market for hard-to-find replacement parts.</span> Contract manufacturer rp+m in Avon Lake, Ohio, uses an ExOne printer to make replacement parts from powdered tungsten for medical-imaging machines built by General Electric Co., Siemens AG and Philips NV. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">In many cases, the original suppliers have gone out of business and replacements parts must be built from scratch, usually in small quantities.\n\n</span>\"Companies order exactly what they need,\" said Matt Hlavin, chief executive of rp+m, which <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 13 3</span>-D printers made by multiple companies.\n\nSome 3-D customers want printed parts but aren't ready to invest in the printers themselves. Hydro Parts Solutions Inc. makes replacement parts for pumps and other equipment at oil refineries and chemical plants. \"The pumps are so old that no one has replacement parts for them,\" said co-owner Jeff Smith.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">His engineers create digital images of the broken or worn part and send it electronically to one of ExOne's seven job shops.</span> There, the printer creates a mold, which has as many <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 11,000 layers</span>, in less <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 24 hours</span>. The mold is used to cast a new metal part. In the past, this process took more than six weeks and the resulting molds weren't as precise and detailed.\n\n\"You can control the shape much better with 3-D,\" said Mr. Smith who ran a foundry <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 20 years</span> before launching Hydro Parts.\n\nWrite to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "61044": {"id": "61044", "text": "<h3>Firms Circle Back to Lower Borrowing Costs</h3>Feb.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 7</span>:51 pm ET\n\nIn the world of corporate borrowing, it rarely gets better than this.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Amid soaring investor demand for high-yielding debt, companies have been able to borrow at some of the lowest rates in history and with some of the fewest restrictions.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In the leveraged-loan market, in which \"junk\"-rated companies borrow from groups of banks and other lenders, companies are taking advantage of low yields to cut the interest rates they pay on debt.</span> This year alone, more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 below</span>-investment-grade companies, including Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Weather Channel, have successfully demanded to renegotiate the rates, and sometimes other terms, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $75.3 billion</span> of loans, the fastest pace <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2007,</span> according to S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\"It's literally been an unprecedented repricing wave in the loan market,\" said Trey Parker, portfolio manager <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">overseeing $13 billion</span> of leveraged-loan investments at Highland Capital Management.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Repricing allows borrowers to attempt to quickly take advantage of improving market conditions by reducing the payments lenders receive.</span> Investors can agree to amended terms or be replaced by others willing to accept less-favorable rates.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Repricings are cheaper and faster than the more traditional way for borrowers to lower interest rates on a loan: repaying the original investors and issuing new debt.\n\n</span>Changing the pricing of a loan is well within a borrower's rights, thanks to a quirk of loan agreements.

The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden\u2019s competition agenda.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.\n</span><span id=\"15\"

class=\"red\">The administration\u2019s focus on increasing competition \u201cwill spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,\u201d said Brian Deese, who heads the White House\u2019s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">And, he added, it \u201cwill deliver lower prices for Americans right away.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">\u201cDid they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden\u2019s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.\n</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were \u201charming competition in the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration\u2019s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation\u2019s ports and to highlight the companies\u2019 promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.\nOverall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden\u2019s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.\n</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Inflation F.A.Q.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">What is inflation?</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world\u2019s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The commission\u2019s analysis determined that market forces \u2014 particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out \u2014 are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> \u201cI think it has upped our credibility\u201d with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,\u201d the report said.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cBusinesses that face meaningful competition can\u2019t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,\u201d said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute\u2019s president.\n</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and \u201cBig Meat\u201d has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack\u2019s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.\nMr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers.

The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden\u2019s competition agenda.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.\n</span><span id=\"15\"

White House\u2019s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">And, he added, it \u201cwill deliver lower prices for Americans right away.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The president\u2019s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">\u201cDid they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden\u2019s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.\n</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were \u201charming competition in the U.S. economy.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration\u2019s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation\u2019s ports and to highlight the companies\u2019 promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.\nOverall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden\u2019s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.\n</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Inflation F.A.Q.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">What is inflation?</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world\u2019s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">The commission\u2019s analysis determined that market forces \u2014 particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out \u2014 are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> \u201cI think it has upped our credibility\u201d with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,\u201d the report said.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cBusinesses that face meaningful competition can\u2019t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,\u201d said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute\u2019s president.\n</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and \u201cBig Meat\u201d has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack\u2019s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.\nMr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden\u2019s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.\n\u201cThese markets have been concentrated for a long time,\u201d said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fix it in his first eight years.

A top House Democrat announced the chamber will vote Thursday to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments.\nThe House will vote on stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee roles as G.O.P. weighs her future.\nThe House will vote Thursday on whether to strip Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, a top Democrat announced, forcing congressional Republicans to take a public stand on the Georgia freshman who endorsed conspiracy theories and calls to execute Democratic politicians before she was elected.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 Democrat</span>, said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, and that \u201cit is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Representative Greene from her committee assignments.\u201d\nHouse Democrats, incensed by a series of social media posts made by Ms. Greene before she won her seat in November, threatened earlier this week that they would take the unusual step of moving unilaterally to remove Ms. Greene from the education and budget committees if Republicans themselves did not take action.</span> Party leaders generally have authority over who represents them on committees.\nThe vote will make Republicans go on the record for the first time on whether Ms. Greene should be rebuked for her past comments.\nWhile most Republican lawmakers have privately been horrified by her rhetoric, some have argued that members of Congress should not face punishment for remarks they made before they were elected, and that allowing one party (in this case, Democrats) to take unilateral action against a lawmaker in another party would set a dangerous precedent. Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber.

And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.\nMs. Greene\u2019s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\"

Biden told the lawmakers on a private conference call, according to two people who participated. \u201cI\u2019m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to people.\u201d\nBut he added: \u201cWe can better target the number \u2014 I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president\u2019s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.\n</span>\u201cWe need to act fast,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s about who the hell we are as a country.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\"

$50,000 a</span> year, with the full payment limited to those whose annual income <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was $40,000 or</span> below.\n</span>Later, Mr. Biden met separately at the White House with Senate Democrats and again discussed narrowing eligibility for the checks.\n\u201cWe did have a conversation about the direct payments and how those might be modified in a way to ensure they\u2019re targeted,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who attended the hourlong session.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On the call with House Democrats, Mr. Biden said he was \u201cnot married to a particular, absolute number\u201d on the overall stimulus package.\n</span>\u201cWe can make compromises on several of the programs,\u201d he told them, adding, \u201cwe have to take care of the people who are hurting.\u201d\nAs for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call that that was \u201cnot in the cards.\u201d\nLuke Broadwater and\nAdvertisement\nSenate Democrats will assume chairmanships of committees under a power-sharing deal with Republicans.\nSenate Democrats will take control of the chamber\u2019s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided. It will allow equal party representation on committees but in the cases of tie votes, legislation or nominees will still advance to the floor for consideration.\nThough the Senate is split 50-50, Democrats are in control by virtue of the power of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote.

Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cOur admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.\u201d\nThe \u201cnotice of voluntary dismissal\u201d of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department\u2019s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit \u201cin light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,\u201d including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard\u2019s admissions practices.\nBut the department said that it would continue an \u201cunderlying investigation\u201d to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.\nThe Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.\n\u201cIt is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,\u201d said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. \u201cUsing race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The government said that race was the \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that \u201cfor the great majority of applicants,\u201d Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.\nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.\nYale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.\nShe and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d\nAt home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees</h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees\nRepublicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene.

Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber.

And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.\nMs. Greene\u2019s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\"

added: \u201cWe can better target the number \u2014 I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president\u2019s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.\n</span>\u201cWe need to act fast,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Democratic lawmakers, according to the people, who detailed the private conversation on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s about who the hell we are as a country.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\"

will take control of the chamber\u2019s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided.

Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cOur admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.\u201d\nThe \u201cnotice of voluntary dismissal\u201d of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department\u2019s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit \u201cin light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,\u201d including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard\u2019s admissions practices.\nBut the department said that it would continue an \u201cunderlying investigation\u201d to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.\nThe Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.\n\u201cIt is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,\u201d said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. \u201cUsing race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The government said that race was the \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that \u201cfor the great majority of applicants,\u201d Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.\nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.\nYale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.\nShe and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d\nAt home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting."}, "73084": {"id": "73084", "text": "<h3>Senate Blocks Justice Department Nominee</h3>Oct.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2009 12</span>:01 am ET\n\nEven our fantasies are being downsized.\n\nNeiman Marcus Group Inc. mailed out its annual Christmas Book catalog, which each year features over-the-top \"fantasy\" gifts, to one million customers on Tuesday. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But for the first time in a decade, there isn't a seven- or eight-figure price tag on the list.\n\n</span>The most expensive fantasy item <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2009 is</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $250,000 </span>\"his and hers\" two-seater Icon aircraft, which comes with pilot training for two.

Neiman Marcus usually sold less than half of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 or</span> so items on its fantasy-gift list\u2014and sometimes only the limited-edition cars.\n\nBut the publicity given to, say, <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $20 million</span> submarine (2000) had its own value. <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> Neiman Marcus, which is owned by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, estimated that it would have had to spend at <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $9 million</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> on advertising to get the television exposure it received from that year's gift list, which included <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.76 million</span> spaceship ride.\n\nBy the time the number of high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. peaked <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> retailers were scrambling to outdo one another in their catalogs and on their Web sites.

This year, Saks Inc.'s Saks Fifth Avenue is discontinuing its practice of marketing \"dreams by design\" or \"wow\" fantasy gift experiences such as a walk-on role in an American Ballet Theatre production sold in an online auction, with bids that started <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $3,000.</span>\n\nThe cuts reflect prolonged frugality among upscale shoppers. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year have fallen by double-digit percentages <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 straight</span> months.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">U.S. sales of luxury goods are expected to <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drop 15% this</span> year, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The dour economic climate has also bred distaste for conspicuous consumption.</span> Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus who is also its corporate gift scout, denies that the absence of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1 million</span>-plus gift is meant to make a statement. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">This year, \"I didn't see anything that I thought was fabulous\" in that price range, she says.</span> But Ms. Reeder examined the cultural mindset as part of her gift-creating process, and the themes she found, such as compassion for the earth, don't seem to square with million-dollar merchandise.\n\nNow awaiting buyers: the \"world's fastest\" electric motorcycle, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $73,000</span>; artwork of insect lab specimens with antique watch parts, <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8,500</span>; and five-foot-long, \"sustainable\" chandeliers made from cut and sanded plastic soda bottles rescued from the landfill, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $12,000.</span> Overall, close <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50% of</span> the merchandise in this year's Neiman catalog costs less <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $250,</span> compared with <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30% to</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40% in</span> the past five years.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Before luxury-goods sales came to a halt last fall, retailers viewed fantasy gifts as powerful marketing tools.</span> The idea was that even those who couldn't afford to buy the over-the-top items would want to buy something from a brand with such cachet. Neiman Marcus usually sold less than half of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 or</span> so items on its fantasy-gift list\u2014and sometimes only the limited-edition cars.\n\nBut the publicity given to, say, <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $20 million</span> submarine (2000) had its own value. <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> Neiman Marcus, which is owned by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, estimated that it would have had to spend at <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least $9 million</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $12 million</span> on advertising to get the television exposure it received from that year's gift list, which included <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.76 million</span> spaceship ride.\n\nBy the time the number of high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. peaked <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> retailers were scrambling to outdo one another in their catalogs and on their Web sites.

I get the frustration.\n\nI, too, am tired of all the PC language that has dominated our culture. I'm tired of having to be careful about everything (and I mean everything) I say for fear of accidentally offending someone and dealing with hyped up repercussions.\n\nI, too, am sickened with politics as usual -- with a stagnant, do-nothing government. I'm tired of unmet promises and of wimpy politicians who won't stand up for what is right and what needs to be done.\n\nI, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again.\n\nSo I get it.\n\nI get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Why wouldn't we want an accomplished businessman to run the \"business\" of the states?</span> Why wouldn't we want a person who could not care less what people think to break through the barriers of our hypersensitive speech? Why wouldn't we root for someone radically different than what we've seen before in Washington, who promises to get stuff done, while at the same time makes us laugh?\n\nBut this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.\n\nFor the Donald has said and done a number of things that many analysts have stated should have knocked him out of the race. But rather than causing him to lose ground with you, you have stood faithful. In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.\n\nTherefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.\n\nSo while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.\n\nOn <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" McCain had <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.\n\nTrump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 298 charities</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2009 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.\n\nIn other words, \"leading\" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:\n\nWounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.\n\nAfter this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $57,000 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.\n\nSo I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly \"imitated\" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.\n\nThough Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.\n\nNot convinced? You decide:\n\nFor any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?\n\nAP Photo/Andrew <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Harnik\n\n3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.\n\nTrump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**.\" Granted, that was <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.\n\nAnd while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had \"the Face of a Dog,\" calling a lawyer \"disgusting\" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.\n\n\"I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\"\n\nThis is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, \"If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\"\n\nAny self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?\n\nIt is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).\n\nLast year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.\n\nMany, as a result, have accused him of being a \"racist.\" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.\n\nPerhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.\n\n</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.\n\nBut if that label of \"racism\" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:\n\na person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is \"bigot.\"\n\nAs Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, \"It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.\"\n\nAs a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.\n\nIn the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.\n\nHe previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as \"incompetent.\"</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is \"the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.\"\n\nHe once said he was \"very pro-choice\" and now he says he is \"very pro-life.\" <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Up <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\n</span>\"In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nJust on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.\n\n</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.\n\nMany Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.\n\nTrump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.\n\nIn your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.\n\nThere was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.\n\nYes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians;\" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an \"active member\" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a \"Christian\") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.\n\nAdd in his questionable moral behaviors, his \"love of money,\" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.\n\nFor many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?\n\nIn addition,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a \"huckster\" and a \"menace to American conservatism.\"\n\nAnd as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).\n\nWe promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.\n\nIt's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.\n\nHIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.\n\nAs writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:\n\nBullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors\" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.\n\nMany mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.\n\nAs clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, \"To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.\"\n\nNarcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, \"Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nMichaelis adds, \"He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.\"\n\nSo why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?\n\nOf course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...\n\n...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).\n\nTrump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama \"led the way.\"\n\nHe has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.\n\nPhoto by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nBut what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?\n\nAnd in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.\n\nFurthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:\n\n\"We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.\"\n\nIn regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, \"Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.\"\n\nNow if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?\n\n\"First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\"\n\nIn terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.\n\nRecently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.\n\nFirst, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?\n\nSecond, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\n\nThird, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?\n\nFourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?\n\nWill he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?\n\nTrump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:\n\n9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).\n\nEarly on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton \"plant\" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.\n\nTrump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.\n\nAs to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.\n\nIf the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).\n\nMy vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.\n\nOr...\n\n9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to \"make America great again,\" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your \"momma\" or \"daddy\" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.\n\nSo far Trump's demonstration of \"great\" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.\n\nMany conservatives themselves, including \"Tea Party\" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.\n\nAnd yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.\n\nRemember, the Donald is playing \"nice\" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 </span>(that's pronounced \"first Samuel eight\"), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.\n\n</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:\n\nNot since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.\n\nBut it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?\n\nNow if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.\n\n\"It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?\"\n\nBut when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.\n\nBut if not then, well, I've already listed it.\n\nThe question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?\n\nAmerica is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.\n\nAmerica is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.\n\nAmerica is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.\n\nIn some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.\n\nBut in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?\n\nIf Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.\n\nIf that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.\n\nSo the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?\n\nI guess we'll start to get a picture soon, beginning <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Feb 1.</span>\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on HonestlyThinking.org.", "displayed_text": "<h3>To Trump Supporters, Here Are 9 Things This Conservative Assumes About You</h3>Dear Trump Supporter,\n\nLet me start by saying that I get it. I get the frustration.\n\nI, too, am tired of all the PC language that has dominated our culture. I'm tired of having to be careful about everything (and I mean everything) I say for fear of accidentally offending someone and dealing with hyped up repercussions.\n\nI, too, am sickened with politics as usual -- with a stagnant, do-nothing government. I'm tired of unmet promises and of wimpy politicians who won't stand up for what is right and what needs to be done.\n\nI, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again.\n\nSo I get it.\n\nI get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Why wouldn't we want an accomplished businessman to run the \"business\" of the states?</span> Why wouldn't we want a person who could not care less what people think to break through the barriers of our hypersensitive speech? Why wouldn't we root for someone radically different than what we've seen before in Washington, who promises to get stuff done, while at the same time makes us laugh?\n\nBut this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.\n\nFor the Donald has said and done a number of things that many analysts have stated should have knocked him out of the race. But rather than causing him to lose ground with you, you have stood faithful. In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.\n\nTherefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.\n\nSo while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.\n\nOn <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" McCain had <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.\n\nTrump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 298 charities</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2009 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.\n\nIn other words, \"leading\" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:\n\nWounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.\n\nAfter this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $57,000 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.\n\nSo I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly \"imitated\" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.\n\nThough Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.\n\nNot convinced? You decide:\n\nFor any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?\n\nAP Photo/Andrew <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Harnik\n\n3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.\n\nTrump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**.\" Granted, that was <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.\n\nAnd while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had \"the Face of a Dog,\" calling a lawyer \"disgusting\" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.\n\n\"I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\"\n\nThis is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, \"If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\"\n\nAny self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?\n\nIt is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).\n\nLast year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.\n\nMany, as a result, have accused him of being a \"racist.\" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.\n\nPerhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.\n\n</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.\n\nBut if that label of \"racism\" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:\n\na person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is \"bigot.\"\n\nAs Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, \"It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.\"\n\nAs a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.\n\nIn the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.\n\nHe previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as \"incompetent.\"</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is \"the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.\"\n\nHe once said he was \"very pro-choice\" and now he says he is \"very pro-life.\" <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Up <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\n</span>\"In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nJust on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.\n\n</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.\n\nMany Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.\n\nTrump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.\n\nIn your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.\n\nThere was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.\n\nYes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians;\" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an \"active member\" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a \"Christian\") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.\n\nAdd in his questionable moral behaviors, his \"love of money,\" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.\n\nFor many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?\n\nIn addition,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a \"huckster\" and a \"menace to American conservatism.\"\n\nAnd as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).\n\nWe promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.\n\nIt's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.\n\nHIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.\n\nAs writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:\n\nBullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors\" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.\n\nMany mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.\n\nAs clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, \"To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.\"\n\nNarcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, \"Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nMichaelis adds, \"He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.\"\n\nSo why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?\n\nOf course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...\n\n...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).\n\nTrump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama \"led the way.\"\n\nHe has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.\n\nPhoto by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nBut what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?\n\nAnd in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.\n\nFurthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:\n\n\"We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.\"\n\nIn regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, \"Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.\"\n\nNow if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?\n\n\"First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\"\n\nIn terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.\n\nRecently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.\n\nFirst, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?\n\nSecond, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\n\nThird, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?\n\nFourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?\n\nWill he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?\n\nTrump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:\n\n9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).\n\nEarly on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton \"plant\" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.\n\nTrump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.\n\nAs to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.\n\nIf the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).\n\nMy vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.\n\nOr...\n\n9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to \"make America great again,\" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your \"momma\" or \"daddy\" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.\n\nSo far Trump's demonstration of \"great\" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.\n\nMany conservatives themselves, including \"Tea Party\" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.\n\nAnd yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.\n\nRemember, the Donald is playing \"nice\" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 </span>(that's pronounced \"first Samuel eight\"), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.\n\n</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:\n\nNot since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.\n\nBut it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?\n\nNow if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.\n\n\"It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?\"\n\nBut when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.\n\nBut if not then, well, I've already listed it.\n\nThe question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?\n\nAmerica is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.\n\nAmerica is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.\n\nAmerica is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.\n\nIn some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.\n\nBut in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?\n\nIf Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.\n\nIf that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.\n\nSo the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?\n\nI guess we'll start to get a picture soon, beginning <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Feb 1.</span>\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on HonestlyThinking.org."}, "59610": {"id": "59610", "text": "<h3>The Health 202: Four possible explanations for the shocking Obamacare enrollment figures</h3>THE PROGNOSIS\nWant more stories about how health-care policy affects you?

With each like and comment, Facebook is \u201cexploiting\u201d human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a \u201csocial-validation feedback loop,\u201d Parker said, adding that it is \u201cexactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.\u201d\nParker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself \"something of a conscientious objector,\" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. \u201cI don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,\u201d Parker said.\n</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month.

That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.\nLate last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August.

Office Designed for Workers With Autism</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The FUTURE of WORK\nWeWorking Class America\u2019s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful and Miserable The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers\u2019 Rights</span> Why Aren\u2019t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?\nWhat happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents\u2019 home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

Fighting for Domestic Workers\u2019 Rights</span> Why Aren\u2019t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?\nWhat happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents\u2019 home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

"<h3>Analysis | These vaccine skeptics are outperforming news outlets on Facebook, Twitter, study finds</h3>The report, produced by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) think tank, zeroes in on the reach of

He said El Ni\u00f1o could lead to shortages of wheat, corn and sugar in some Southern Hemisphere countries, although higher rainfall could help crops elsewhere.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Market fears about the impact of El Ni\u00f1o have eased due to a good start to the monsoon season in India and Bangladesh, said Aurelia Britsch, senior commodities analyst at BMI Research.</span> The monsoon season has brought more rain than normal despite earlier forecasts that India\u2019s rainfall would be down <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 12%,</span> while the weather in northern parts of Asia has been broadly in line with historical averages.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Any upward pressure on food prices from El Ni\u00f1o could also be offset by ample stocks of several commodities, particularly of rice, palm oil and sugar, some analysts say.\n\n</span>And while dry conditions could weigh on crop yields in Asia, wetter weather caused by El Ni\u00f1o in South America could boost crops of soybeans, corn and sugar there.\n\nWrite to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.
