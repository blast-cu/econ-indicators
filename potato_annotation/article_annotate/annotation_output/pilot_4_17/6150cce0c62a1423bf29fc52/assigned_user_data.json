The government has effectively collapsed, and tens of thousands have died.\nThe country already faced many health challenges before the coronavirus emerged. Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.\nThe pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.\n\u201cCovid has made life even worse for people across the country,\u201d Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam\u2019s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.\nSome relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.\nThe country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.\n</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.\nIn shelters that host <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.\n\u201cThe country is not able to cope with another health crisis,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received.

That figure has shot up <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.\nOn Wednesday, the state said it had activated \u201ccrisis standards of care,\u201d giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.\nGov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.\nJared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge \u201ccrippling\u201d in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.\n\u201cWe are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Kosin said.\nCritically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\u201cUnlike in the <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lower 48,</span> you don\u2019t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,\u201d said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.\nMr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,\u201d he said.\nAlaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.\nDr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,\u201d Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.\nOn the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.\nThe state\u2019s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country\u2019s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.\nAdvertisement\nThe C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency\u2019s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s endorsements over her own agency\u2019s advisers.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision was a boost for President Biden\u2019s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.\n\u201cI am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.\nBut the vote on boosters for occupational risk \u201cwas close,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThis addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,\u201d Dr. Maldonado added.\nMinutes before Dr. Walensky\u2019s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director\u2019s decision.\n\u201cDr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,\u201d Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. \u201cI am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.\u201d\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision to go against her own agency\u2019s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director\u2019s endorsement of the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.\nBut experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement\u201d on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would \u201cbest serve the nation\u2019s public health needs.\u201d\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.\nThe Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.\nAt a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family. The government is encouraging people to get tested following the holiday.\nChuseok is roughly equivalent to American Thanksgiving and was observed from Monday through Wednesday. The Korea Transport Institute estimated that <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 32 million</span> people would travel over the holiday.\nOver the past week the nation was averaging <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1,500 new</span> cases a day, according to statistics collected by Our World in Data. Most cases are concentrated in the capital, Seoul, and surrounding areas, but officials were concerned that the holiday would spread the virus more widely.\nTesting and quarantining were the main tools South Korea used to curb the spread of the disease, and the country was able to keep outbreaks at bay in the early part of the pandemic.\nSouth Korea\u2019s vaccination program got off to a slow start, but the country has now <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">vaccinated 43 percent</span> of its population. It hopes to <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 70 percent</span> of its population inoculated by October.\n\u201cThere is no problem at all with the amount of vaccines secured for this year,\u201d President Moon Jae-in said on Friday, according to Reuters. \u201cThe vaccine shipment got off to a slower start than other countries, which delayed the vaccination program, but I believe by next month, we will catch up and be a leading country by inoculation rate.\u201d\nA few weeks ago the government relaxed several restrictions on in-person meetings. For Chuseok, family gatherings of up to eight people were permitted if at least four people were fully vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nHospitals near a grocery store shooting in Collierville, Tenn., were already struggling to keep up with Covid-19 patients when those injured in the attack arrived in emergency rooms on Thursday.\nNational Guard troops had been stationed at medical centers to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients, and emergency medical providers had recently issued a dire warning to local officials about the strain on hospitals.\n\u201cCurrently our system emergency departments are operating dangerously over capacity,\u201d the medical providers wrote on Aug.<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16.</span> They added, \u201cWe may be unable to provide timely care to everyone and will have to make choices about delivering care to patients based on their probability of survival.\u201d\nThey expressed particular concern about what could happen in the event of a disaster, given that \u201cthe city has no surge capacity to accommodate any additional disaster or unplanned events.\u201d\nAn average <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 96 percent</span> of I.C.U. beds were occupied in Shelby County, Tenn., on Thursday, according to New York Times data. One nearby facility, St. Francis Hospital, reported that its I.C.U. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 100 percent</span> full; another said its I.C.U. <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 97 percent</span> full.

She said the hospital had the capacity to accommodate those patients. Baptist Memorial Hospital in Collierville received one patient, who was discharged, and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis received two, according to a spokeswoman.\nShelby County reported its highest number of Covid-19 cases during the pandemic last month. Those numbers have decreased slightly in recent weeks but remain high, with a seven-day average <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 409 cases</span>.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Only 44 percent</span> of the state\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated. Governor Bill Lee recently signed an executive order overruling attempts by local officials to require masks in schools.

Melbourne\u2019s playgrounds were wrapped in police tape, and traveling from a state with Covid restrictions to one without \u2014 for the lucky few granted permission by the authorities \u2014 requires two-week stints in quarantine at a hotel or a remote former mining camp.\nThere are now two Australias.

The working-class areas with the highest infection rates have faced a heavy police presence, and, until recently, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 9 p</span>.m. curfew and just an hour of outdoor exercise per day.\nIs the sacrifice worth it?\nAustralia is at a crossroads with Covid. The confidence and pride <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> when lockdowns and isolation brought outbreaks to heel, have been replaced by doubt, fatigue and a bitter battle over how much freedom or risk should be allowed in a Delta-defined future.\nSome states are trying desperately to hold on to what worked before, while New South Wales and Victoria, home to the country\u2019s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are being forced by Delta outbreaks to find a more nuanced path forward. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has thrown his weight behind a plan to reopen <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">when 80 percent</span> of adults are fully vaccinated. But the road ahead may not be smooth \u2014 as shown by protests this week over a vaccine mandate \u2014 and state leaders are still insisting that they will go it alone.\n\u201cWe might be looking at the country turning the clock back on itself,\u201d said Tim Soutphommasane, a political theorist at the University of Sydney. \u201cThere is an explicit insularity and parochialism that now dictates debate.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Covid Live Updates: War-Torn Yemen Sees Virus Cases Spike, Charity Says</h3>Covid Live Updates: War-Torn Yemen Sees Virus Cases Spike, Charity Says\nThe official death toll doesn\u2019t tell the story, the British organization Oxfam says.

Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.\nThe pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.\n\u201cCovid has made life even worse for people across the country,\u201d Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam\u2019s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.\nSome relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.\nThe country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.\n</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.\nIn shelters that host <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.\n\u201cThe country is not able to cope with another health crisis,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received. The health care system is dangerously underfunded, working with <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 11 percent</span> of what it needs, the organization says.\nSome had hoped that the pandemic would force Yemen\u2019s warring parties into a truce, but the war continues.\n\u201cIf anything, it is amazing how little the pandemic has affected the fighting,\u201d said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst on Yemen for the International Crisis Group, in an interview.\nThe terror and uncertainty of the war, which has forced people to deal with loss on a daily basis for years, remains a larger concern for many Yemenis than the pandemic itself. \u201cThis speaks to the trauma of the conflict,\u201d Mr. Salisbury said.\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Sept. 23||14-day change|\n|New cases||126,760||\u201314%|\n|New deaths||2,036||+29%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Sept. 23||14-day change|\n|New cases||506,623||\u201313%|\n|New deaths||8,357||\u20139%|\nAlaska, once a leader in vaccinating its citizens, is now in the throes of its worst coronavirus surge of the pandemic, as the Delta variant rips through the state, swamping hospitals with patients.\nAs of Thursday, the state was <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averaging 125 new</span> cases a day for <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">every 100,000 people</span>, more than any other in the nation, according to recent data trends collected by The New York Times. That figure has shot up <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.\nOn Wednesday, the state said it had activated \u201ccrisis standards of care,\u201d giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.\nGov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.\nJared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge \u201ccrippling\u201d in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.\n\u201cWe are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Kosin said.\nCritically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\u201cUnlike in the <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lower 48,</span> you don\u2019t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,\u201d said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.\nMr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,\u201d he said.\nAlaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.\nDr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,\u201d Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.\nOn the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.\nThe state\u2019s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country\u2019s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.\nAdvertisement\nThe C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency\u2019s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s endorsements over her own agency\u2019s advisers.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision was a boost for President Biden\u2019s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.\n\u201cI am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.\nBut the vote on boosters for occupational risk \u201cwas close,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThis addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,\u201d Dr. Maldonado added.\nMinutes before Dr. Walensky\u2019s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director\u2019s decision.\n\u201cDr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,\u201d Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. \u201cI am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.\u201d\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision to go against her own agency\u2019s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director\u2019s endorsement of the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.\nBut experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement\u201d on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would \u201cbest serve the nation\u2019s public health needs.\u201d\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.\nThe Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.\nAt a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family. The government is encouraging people to get tested following the holiday.\nChuseok is roughly equivalent to American Thanksgiving and was observed from Monday through Wednesday. The Korea Transport Institute estimated that <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 32 million</span> people would travel over the holiday.\nOver the past week the nation was averaging <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1,500 new</span> cases a day, according to statistics collected by Our World in Data. Most cases are concentrated in the capital, Seoul, and surrounding areas, but officials were concerned that the holiday would spread the virus more widely.\nTesting and quarantining were the main tools South Korea used to curb the spread of the disease, and the country was able to keep outbreaks at bay in the early part of the pandemic.\nSouth Korea\u2019s vaccination program got off to a slow start, but the country has now <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">vaccinated 43 percent</span> of its population. It hopes to <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 70 percent</span> of its population inoculated by October.\n\u201cThere is no problem at all with the amount of vaccines secured for this year,\u201d President Moon Jae-in said on Friday, according to Reuters. \u201cThe vaccine shipment got off to a slower start than other countries, which delayed the vaccination program, but I believe by next month, we will catch up and be a leading country by inoculation rate.\u201d\nA few weeks ago the government relaxed several restrictions on in-person meetings. For Chuseok, family gatherings of up to eight people were permitted if at least four people were fully vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nHospitals near a grocery store shooting in Collierville, Tenn., were already struggling to keep up with Covid-19 patients when those injured in the attack arrived in emergency rooms on Thursday.\nNational Guard troops had been stationed at medical centers to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients, and emergency medical providers had recently issued a dire warning to local officials about the strain on hospitals.\n\u201cCurrently our system emergency departments are operating dangerously over capacity,\u201d the medical providers wrote on Aug.<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16.</span> They added, \u201cWe may be unable to provide timely care to everyone and will have to make choices about delivering care to patients based on their probability of survival.\u201d\nThey expressed particular concern about what could happen in the event of a disaster, given that \u201cthe city has no surge capacity to accommodate any additional disaster or unplanned events.\u201d\nAn average <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 96 percent</span> of I.C.U. beds were occupied in Shelby County, Tenn., on Thursday, according to New York Times data. One nearby facility, St. Francis Hospital, reported that its I.C.U. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 100 percent</span> full; another said its I.C.U. <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 97 percent</span> full.

She said the hospital had the capacity to accommodate those patients. Baptist Memorial Hospital in Collierville received one patient, who was discharged, and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis received two, according to a spokeswoman.\nShelby County reported its highest number of Covid-19 cases during the pandemic last month. Those numbers have decreased slightly in recent weeks but remain high, with a seven-day average <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 409 cases</span>.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Only 44 percent</span> of the state\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated. Governor Bill Lee recently signed an executive order overruling attempts by local officials to require masks in schools. A federal judge blocked the governor\u2019s order from taking effect in Shelby County on Friday after opponents fought it in court.\nSophie Kasakove and\nSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 In the war against the coronavirus\u2019s Delta variant, few if any democracies have demanded as much of their people as Australia.\nIn the middle of the latest lockdowns, the police in Sydney gave hefty fines to three mothers with strollers chatting in a park. Melbourne\u2019s playgrounds were wrapped in police tape, and traveling from a state with Covid restrictions to one without \u2014 for the lucky few granted permission by the authorities \u2014 requires two-week stints in quarantine at a hotel or a remote former mining camp.\nThere are now two Australias. In Perth, offices, pubs and stadiums are crammed and normal as ever \u2014 the payoff for a closed-border approach that has made Western Australia an island within an island. In Sydney, residents are approaching their 14th week of lockdown. The working-class areas with the highest infection rates have faced a heavy police presence, and, until recently, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 9 p</span>.m. curfew and just an hour of outdoor exercise per day.\nIs the sacrifice worth it?\nAustralia is at a crossroads with Covid. The confidence and pride <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> when lockdowns and isolation brought outbreaks to heel, have been replaced by doubt, fatigue and a bitter battle over how much freedom or risk should be allowed in a Delta-defined future.\nSome states are trying desperately to hold on to what worked before, while New South Wales and Victoria, home to the country\u2019s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are being forced by Delta outbreaks to find a more nuanced path forward. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has thrown his weight behind a plan to reopen <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">when 80 percent</span> of adults are fully vaccinated. But the road ahead may not be smooth \u2014 as shown by protests this week over a vaccine mandate \u2014 and state leaders are still insisting that they will go it alone.\n\u201cWe might be looking at the country turning the clock back on itself,\u201d said Tim Soutphommasane, a political theorist at the University of Sydney. \u201cThere is an explicit insularity and parochialism that now dictates debate.\u201d"}, "42091": {"id": "42091", "text": "<h3>Value Stocks Beckon Investors in Aging Bull Market</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Positions pared in tech stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns\n\nSept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 25,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET\n\nU.S. stocks\u2019</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.\n\nAssets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record $50.3 billion</span> in September.

Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2016.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 shed</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.8%.</span>\n\n</span>Momentum stocks haven\u2019t been as widely held as they are now <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.\n\n</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.\n\n</span>Momentum trades \u201cworked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,\u201d Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16.</span>\n\nStill, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,\u201d said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.\u201d\n\nYet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn\u2019t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2001.</span>\n\n</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand that value cannot die,\u201d she said.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.

visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. \"You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,\" she said.\n\nMr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.\n\nCrude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha\u2014groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.\n\n</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad\u2014but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.\n\nMr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.\n\n\"If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,\" he said.\n\nAyman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.\n\nIn normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.\n\nInside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.\n\nMost of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are \"temporarily\" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.\n\n</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.\n\nMr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, \"Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>\"\n\nAlthough the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8",

visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. \"You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,\" she said.\n\nMr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.\n\n</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience\u2014in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah\u2014is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.\n\nCrude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha\u2014groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.\n\n</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad\u2014but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.\n\nMr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.\n\n\"If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,\" he said.\n\nAyman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.\n\nIn normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.\n\nInside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.\n\nMost of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are \"temporarily\" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.\n\n</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.\n\nMr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, \"Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>\"\n\nAlthough the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.\n\nFor nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.\n\nMr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said\u2014showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.\n\nWith Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.\n\nThe nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.\n\nMr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.\n\n\"We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,\" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.\n\nMr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.\n\nMr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.\n\n\"We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,\" he said.\n\nLately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.\n\nMr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. \"They are mere riffraff,\" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.\n\nLast July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.\n\nMr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 24 hours</span> to \"apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms\" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.\n\n</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.\n\nMr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called \"threats against his personal safety in Syria.\" In <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.\n\nMr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same \"conspiracy\" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.\n\nAs for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. \"If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "87390": {"id": "87390", "text": "<h3>Fixed mortgage rates are back down to February lows after sharp decline in bond yields and removal of unpopular refinance fee</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 80 lenders</span> nationwide to come up with weekly national averages.</span> It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with high credit scores and large down payments.

Doctors found that combining the newer type of antiretroviral drug with two drugs from an earlier class hindered the virus from developing resistance.\n\nA three-drug regimen has remained the standard approach since then, with drug development efforts focused on making ever more powerful triple combinations.\n\nGlaxo executives want to change that. They hope the U.K.-based drug company\u2019s latest HIV pill is powerful enough to suppress the virus with the help of just one other drug. That, according to Chief Executive Andrew Witty, would be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d because taking fewer drugs would produce fewer side effects.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Now, Glaxo\u2019s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare, in which Pfizer Inc. <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">PFE 2.30</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle of the U.S. and <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Shionogi 4507 </span>-1.46%decrease; red down pointing triangle & Co. of Japan hold minority stakes, is getting down to the long process of proving it.\n\n</span>The drug in question, dolutegravir, is one of a class of HIV drugs known as integrase inhibitors that rapidly reduce the level of virus in the blood. It is already approved for use as part of traditional triple therapy and so far, there are no reported cases of the virus developing resistance to dolutegravir in patients who are new to treatment. That makes it unique among integrase inhibitors, according to David Hardy, an HIV doctor and a spokesman for the HIV Medicines Association, an advocacy group.\n\nWhile dolutegravir\u2019s profile suggests it could potentially suppress HIV without the help of any other drug, Glaxo is taking a precautionary stepwise approach to investigating its promise, said a company spokeswoman.\n\nThe most important benefit of a two-drug regimen is that it would come with fewer side effects. Such effects, including nausea, diarrhea, kidney problems and bone-thinning, are one of the most common reasons for patients to change an HIV regimen. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">It could also lighten the financial burden of HIV.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Rochelle Walensky, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, estimated that switching just a quarter of patients currently on triple therapy to dolutegravir plus 3TC\u2014an older, generic HIV drug\u2014would knock more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $3 billion</span> off the cost of treating HIV over a five-year period.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The cost saving is less clear if both drugs in the regimen are still under patent protection.\n\n</span>Glaxo is putting \u201ctremendous focus and priority\u201d on the development of two-drug regimens, Mr. Witty said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">According to analysis by UBS, the opportunity is significant: If dual therapy becomes the strategy that doctors prefer, Glaxo could grab a much bigger slice of the market and overtake Gilead Sciences Inc. to become the biggest player in HIV treatment within three years.\n\n</span>Over the past year, Glaxo has started several large clinical trials that aim to show that combining dolutegravir with just one other HIV medicine works as well as traditional triple therapy at suppressing the virus.\n\nIn one set of trials, it is testing dolutegravir alongside rilpivirine, a brand-name HIV drug made by Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals. In another, it is combining dolutegravir with 3TC, the generic drug used in Dr. Walensky\u2019s analysis.\n\nIt also plans to start a late-stage trial combining an injectable version of dolutegravir with rilpivirine. An earlier trial showed this combination was as effective as a three-drug regimen when the virus had already been suppressed by an initial period of triple therapy.\n\nThe trials won\u2019t start yielding results until next year, but a small study led by Pedro Cahn, a doctor in Argentina, offers some reason for optimism. In that 48-week trial, dolutegravir plus 3TC suppressed HIV levels <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 18 out</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 previously</span> untreated patients.\n\nEven if Glaxo\u2019s large clinical trials succeed, it could face another challenge: inertia.\n\nIn the past year, Gilead has launched a series of triple therapies using a new HIV drug called TAF that can be administered at a much lower dose than its predecessor, causing less harm to the kidneys.\n\nChristoph Wyen, an HIV specialist at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, said the advent of these less-toxic triple therapies reduces the incentive for doctors to switch patients to simpler regimens.

Doctors found that combining the newer type of antiretroviral drug with two drugs from an earlier class hindered the virus from developing resistance.\n\nA three-drug regimen has remained the standard approach since then, with drug development efforts focused on making ever more powerful triple combinations.\n\nGlaxo executives want to change that. They hope the U.K.-based drug company\u2019s latest HIV pill is powerful enough to suppress the virus with the help of just one other drug. That, according to Chief Executive Andrew Witty, would be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d because taking fewer drugs would produce fewer side effects.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Now, Glaxo\u2019s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare, in which Pfizer Inc. <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">PFE 2.30</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle of the U.S. and <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Shionogi 4507 </span>-1.46%decrease; red down pointing triangle & Co. of Japan hold minority stakes, is getting down to the long process of proving it.\n\n</span>The drug in question, dolutegravir, is one of a class of HIV drugs known as integrase inhibitors that rapidly reduce the level of virus in the blood. It is already approved for use as part of traditional triple therapy and so far, there are no reported cases of the virus developing resistance to dolutegravir in patients who are new to treatment. That makes it unique among integrase inhibitors, according to David Hardy, an HIV doctor and a spokesman for the HIV Medicines Association, an advocacy group.\n\nWhile dolutegravir\u2019s profile suggests it could potentially suppress HIV without the help of any other drug, Glaxo is taking a precautionary stepwise approach to investigating its promise, said a company spokeswoman.\n\nThe most important benefit of a two-drug regimen is that it would come with fewer side effects. Such effects, including nausea, diarrhea, kidney problems and bone-thinning, are one of the most common reasons for patients to change an HIV regimen. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">It could also lighten the financial burden of HIV.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Rochelle Walensky, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, estimated that switching just a quarter of patients currently on triple therapy to dolutegravir plus 3TC\u2014an older, generic HIV drug\u2014would knock more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $3 billion</span> off the cost of treating HIV over a five-year period.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The cost saving is less clear if both drugs in the regimen are still under patent protection.\n\n</span>Glaxo is putting \u201ctremendous focus and priority\u201d on the development of two-drug regimens, Mr. Witty said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">According to analysis by UBS, the opportunity is significant: If dual therapy becomes the strategy that doctors prefer, Glaxo could grab a much bigger slice of the market and overtake Gilead Sciences Inc. to become the biggest player in HIV treatment within three years.\n\n</span>Over the past year, Glaxo has started several large clinical trials that aim to show that combining dolutegravir with just one other HIV medicine works as well as traditional triple therapy at suppressing the virus.\n\nIn one set of trials, it is testing dolutegravir alongside rilpivirine, a brand-name HIV drug made by Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals. In another, it is combining dolutegravir with 3TC, the generic drug used in Dr. Walensky\u2019s analysis.\n\nIt also plans to start a late-stage trial combining an injectable version of dolutegravir with rilpivirine. An earlier trial showed this combination was as effective as a three-drug regimen when the virus had already been suppressed by an initial period of triple therapy.\n\nThe trials won\u2019t start yielding results until next year, but a small study led by Pedro Cahn, a doctor in Argentina, offers some reason for optimism. In that 48-week trial, dolutegravir plus 3TC suppressed HIV levels <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 18 out</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 previously</span> untreated patients.\n\nEven if Glaxo\u2019s large clinical trials succeed, it could face another challenge: inertia.\n\nIn the past year, Gilead has launched a series of triple therapies using a new HIV drug called TAF that can be administered at a much lower dose than its predecessor, causing less harm to the kidneys.\n\nChristoph Wyen, an HIV specialist at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, said the advent of these less-toxic triple therapies reduces the incentive for doctors to switch patients to simpler regimens. He said dual therapy might take off more quickly in older patients, who are more likely to have age-related health complications.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Gilead and Glaxo both have strong positions in the HIV market with TAF- and dolutegravir-based triple regimens, respectively.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But Gilead is developing a new integrase inhibitor that, if proven equal to dolutegravir, could give it an important advantage in the triple-therapy market.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The worst-case scenario for Glaxo would be for its dual therapies to fail and for Gilead\u2019s integrase inhibitor\u2014which, if successful, is expected to launch in 2018\u2014to steal market share from dolutegravir.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That could send Glaxo\u2019s HIV business into decline <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 2018,</span> according to UBS, though Mr. Witty says that the downside is limited because dolutegravir will be well-established by the time Gilead\u2019s competitor comes along.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that [dual therapy] is going to work,\u201d said Dr. Hardy.

As a result, FEMA and city officials say, New York could be an example for other places around the country.\nBut the maps will also be shaped by the history of New York, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">where 80 percent</span> of properties were built before the current flood maps and requirements were in place, as opposed <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span> nationally, noted J. Andrew Martin, acting chief of FEMA\u2019s risk analysis branch in New York. If those older buildings end up in high-risk zones, their owners could be required to buy flood insurance or make expensive modifications, adding costs that are beyond the reach of many working-class homeowners.<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Continue reading the main story\nThe collision of science with political and economic realities means that the battle over how many more people will fall in the flood zones will be fought house by house, block by block, with millions of dollars at stake.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a game of inches,\u201d said Elizabeth Malone, program manager of resiliency and insurance at Neighborhood Housing Services Brooklyn, a community group that counsels residents in flood-prone areas.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In New York, where more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50,000 people</span> are homeless, and where the mayor has pledged to create or <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">preserve 200,000 units</span> of affordable housing by the end <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2022,</span> the FEMA maps could add further financial strain.\n</span>The city has already pushed back against FEMA. The agency proposed preliminary maps <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 </span>\u2014 soon after Hurricane Sandy \u2014 that would have doubled both the area of flood zones and the number of people inside them. The city, in an unusual move, successfully challenged the scientific assumptions underlying the new maps.\nIn the coming weeks, formal discussions on the maps between New York City and the agency will likely begin.\nThere is no time to waste, said Mr. Martin, who has been on assignment in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. \u201cSandy may not happen again like it did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will be something very similar, and it\u2019s not that far off.\u201d\nBut the process will not be fast, and homeowners should be prepared to be in \u201climbo\u201d for years, said Daniel A. Zarrilli, the city\u2019s chief resilience officer and senior director for climate policy and programs. That may not be ideal, he said, but it is \u201cbetter than it could have been had the city not worked to protect affordability and incorporate climate risks onto the maps. We don\u2019t want to jack up insurance rates and cause a foreclosure crisis, and we want a smoother glide path to a better flood insurance program, and more accurate maps.\u201dContinue reading the main story\nAn Affordability Challenge\nThe first time FEMA mapped the city was <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1983.</span> Since then, only minor changes have been made. The agency was working on an update, as requested by the city, when Hurricane Sandy hit.\nA month later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane.\nThe audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone.\nIn the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.\n</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.\nIndeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact. One recent federal report estimated there was <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 40 percent</span> \u201cuncertainty of flood predictions.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA\u2019s proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation \u2014 the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood \u2014 by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, \u201cunnecessarily putting <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately 26,000 buildings</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 170,000 residents</span>\u201d in higher-risk locations and \u201ccausing an affordability challenge.\u201d\nIn March, at the city\u2019s request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps\u2019 potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The report found that the proposed maps could \u201creduce property values, increase loan defaults, lower tax revenue, and create hardships for current residents.</span>\u201dContinue reading the main story\nOne area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2013 proposal</span></span>, the difference for the area is stark: <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Just 26 buildings</span> were in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1983 FEMA</span> flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 5,000 buildings</span>.\nCanarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">But in a neighborhood that weathered the city\u2019s highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have \u201clittle to put toward mitigating their flood risk,\u201d according to a city report released in May.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor\u2019s Office of Storm Recovery.</span> By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established.\nWith such coverage, premiums would probably be <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $500 a</span> year; without it, the annual rates could <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be $3,000.</span>\nBut <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">even $500 a</span> year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood.\nOn Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA\u2019s flood zones. If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone.\n\u201cIf you get flood insurance, you can\u2019t pay your other bills,\u201d he said.\nTheresa Fraser lives on Canarsie Road, a half mile from Jamaica Bay.

As a result, FEMA and city officials say, New York could be an example for other places around the country.\nBut the maps will also be shaped by the history of New York, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">where 80 percent</span> of properties were built before the current flood maps and requirements were in place, as opposed <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20 percent</span> nationally, noted J.

In the next zone, an area has <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.\n</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.\nIndeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact.

He even copies his haircut and dress\n\nUpdated Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 1</span>:51 am ET\n\nSEOUL\u2014Kim Jong Un was a virtual unknown when his father died of a heart attack in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011 and</span> left him the leader of North Korea.\n\nIntelligence analysts knew little more than he was a man in his 20s who had attended school in Switzerland and loved basketball. Some guessed Mr. Kim, third in a line of Kim-family dictators, would be a weak, short-lived ruler. Governments abroad feared a violent collapse, but also hoped that the end of the family\u2019s rule would reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.\n\nInstead of chaos, however, there appeared to be a plan, according to experts on the tightly closed country.\n\nMr. Kim has solidified his command by cloaking brutality in the folksy style and pragmatic politics of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation\u2019s founder whom many still regard with nostalgia and reverence. Mr. Kim has mirrored his grandfather\u2019s propaganda and policies, even his style of dress.\n\nWhile purging potential challengers, particularly among North Korea\u2019s generals, Mr. Kim has strengthened his military support with a nuclear-arms push.\n\nIn short, Mr. Kim has turned out to be a \u201cvery skilled dictator,\u201d said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert and professor at Troy University in Seoul.\n\nAfter its latest nuclear test this month, North Korea said it could now rapidly churn out nuclear warheads for its missiles, a claim impossible to verify. Experts suspect North Korea is only a few years away from the capability of striking the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">While buttressing the military with arms spending, Mr. Kim has gained domestic backing and prestige with high-profile construction projects in the capital city of Pyongyang, say defectors, and by allowing growth of a rudimentary market economy\u2014though his popularity is difficult to accurately gauge.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">North Korea has more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 million</span> mobile-phone subscribers and a new class of private traders and financiers despite the country\u2019s official communist orthodoxy, defectors say.\n\n</span>To the rest of the world, Mr. Kim\u2019s acceleration of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u2014more powerful bombs and improved missiles to deliver them\u2014makes him an especially dangerous leader.\n\nLooking back, it appears that Kim Jong Un and his aides likely decided from the start that the new leader should emulate his popular grandfather rather than his dour father, said Michael Madden, a U.S.-based North Korea expert. Many of those aides worked with both previous leaders.\n\nFor starters, Kim Jong Un looked remarkably like a younger version of his grandfather, both in his stocky build and facial features. Mr. Kim, believed now to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 32 years</span> old, had his hair closely cropped in his grandfather\u2019s style and wore the black Mao-style uniforms and western suits favored by Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe embalmed body of Kim Il Sung, who ruled from the country\u2019s founding <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1948 until</span> his death <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span> lies in a viewing case at an airport-sized mausoleum.

Some guessed Mr. Kim, third in a line of Kim-family dictators, would be a weak, short-lived ruler. Governments abroad feared a violent collapse, but also hoped that the end of the family\u2019s rule would reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat.\n\nInstead of chaos, however, there appeared to be a plan, according to experts on the tightly closed country.\n\nMr. Kim has solidified his command by cloaking brutality in the folksy style and pragmatic politics of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation\u2019s founder whom many still regard with nostalgia and reverence. Mr. Kim has mirrored his grandfather\u2019s propaganda and policies, even his style of dress.\n\nWhile purging potential challengers, particularly among North Korea\u2019s generals, Mr. Kim has strengthened his military support with a nuclear-arms push.\n\nIn short, Mr. Kim has turned out to be a \u201cvery skilled dictator,\u201d said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert and professor at Troy University in Seoul.\n\nAfter its latest nuclear test this month, North Korea said it could now rapidly churn out nuclear warheads for its missiles, a claim impossible to verify. Experts suspect North Korea is only a few years away from the capability of striking the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">While buttressing the military with arms spending, Mr. Kim has gained domestic backing and prestige with high-profile construction projects in the capital city of Pyongyang, say defectors, and by allowing growth of a rudimentary market economy\u2014though his popularity is difficult to accurately gauge.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">North Korea has more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 million</span> mobile-phone subscribers and a new class of private traders and financiers despite the country\u2019s official communist orthodoxy, defectors say.\n\n</span>To the rest of the world, Mr. Kim\u2019s acceleration of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u2014more powerful bombs and improved missiles to deliver them\u2014makes him an especially dangerous leader.\n\nLooking back, it appears that Kim Jong Un and his aides likely decided from the start that the new leader should emulate his popular grandfather rather than his dour father, said Michael Madden, a U.S.-based North Korea expert. Many of those aides worked with both previous leaders.\n\nFor starters, Kim Jong Un looked remarkably like a younger version of his grandfather, both in his stocky build and facial features. Mr. Kim, believed now to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">be 32 years</span> old, had his hair closely cropped in his grandfather\u2019s style and wore the black Mao-style uniforms and western suits favored by Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe embalmed body of Kim Il Sung, who ruled from the country\u2019s founding <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1948 until</span> his death <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994,</span> lies in a viewing case at an airport-sized mausoleum.

The concern, she said, is that the companies will extract too much water and deprive cities and farms in the area of a valuable resource. Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.\nOnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China\u2019s growing market.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">China currently consumes <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world\u2019s supply of the product, according to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 20 gallons</span>\u2014or <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles\u2014a year, and analysts expect the country\u2019s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.\n</span>Water resources within China are limited.

The concern, she said, is that the companies will extract too much water and deprive cities and farms in the area of a valuable resource. Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.\nOnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China\u2019s growing market.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">China currently consumes <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world\u2019s supply of the product, according to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 20 gallons</span>\u2014or <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles\u2014a year, and analysts expect the country\u2019s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.\n</span>Water resources within China are limited.

On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach\u2019s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.\n\nMr. Parker denies his company\u2019s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.\n\nMr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker\u2019s Kitchen chain <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family\u2019s assets are frozen. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl\u2019s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n</span>\u201cI\u2019ve <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I\u2019m really, really proud of,\u201d Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won\u2019t settle the case, because to settle would be \u201cto have Parker\u2019s name besmirched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should stand up for what\u2019s right. And I\u2019m standing up for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.\n\nThe litigation so far hasn\u2019t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family\u2019s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.\n\n</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker\u2019s team improperly plied a boat passenger\u2019s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker\u2019s team and a crisis communications firm.\n\nMr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker \u201cfor everything he\u2019s got\u201d because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker\u2019s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.\n\n\u201cI can prove everything he did and I\u2019m going to, and he\u2019s going to write me a big check,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said.\n\nPower in county\n\nThe boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh\u2019s alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\n</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor\u2019s, or district attorney\u2019s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family\u2019s close working relationship with local law enforcement.\n\nBefore he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.\n\nBased on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n\nIn the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 7,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The state\u2019s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides \u201cthe background and the motive\u201d for the double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul\u2019s slight build didn\u2019t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother\u2019s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.\n\n\u201cWhen you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don\u2019t even read the information on the ID, it\u2019s apparent what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren\u2019t rigorously followed at Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.\n\n</span>Night of drinking\n\nThe fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span>\n\nPaul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker\u2019s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III\u2019s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.\n\nVideo footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver\u2019s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $49 on</span> his mother\u2019s credit card.\n\nAfter Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.\n\nThe six young people met at Paul\u2019s grandfather\u2019s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast\u2014a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry\u2014at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.\n\nOn the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn\u2019t have running lights. Just <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.\n\nSeveral passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, \u201cscreaming, cussing and saying horrible things,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn\u2019t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.\n\nIt took a week to find Ms. Beach\u2019s body, which was facedown in the <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.\n\nMr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 29,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker\u2019s company.\n\nThe hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.\n\nAlex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach\u2019s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.\n\nThat left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.\n\nThe wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nQuirk in liability law\n\nMr. Parker,<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and \u201cChewy Ice,\u201d which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.\n\nAs Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh\u2019s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh\u2019s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.\n\nMs. Cohen \u201ctakes the driver\u2019s license,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cShe looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.\u201d Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother\u2019s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach\u2019s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn\u2019t follow other company policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got great written policies,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. \u201cIf they did what they said they were going to do, I don\u2019t think this happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.\n\nMs. Cohen isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.\n\nAlcohol-enforcement authorities haven\u2019t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen \u201cdid her due diligence,\u201d by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">State law doesn\u2019t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.\n\n</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018Well, wait a minute. If I\u2019m one-millionth <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% liable</span>?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. \u201cHow does that work? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.\n\nThe law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.\n\nIn December<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nMr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker\u2019s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.\n\nMr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker\u2019s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.\n\nSuper Bowl party\n\nRhett Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.\n\nWhen asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, \u201cNot that she knows of.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he can\u2019t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said \u201cwe sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have directed anybody to break the law,\u201d including by buying alcohol for someone underage.\n\nMr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker\u2019s investigation wouldn\u2019t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn\u2019t the cause of the boat crash. \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Parker\u2019s side was \u201ccollecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Mr. Parker\u2019s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.\n\nThe suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for \u201cMurdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,\u201d a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.\n\nMs. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that \u201cwhoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules\u201d and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.\n\nMr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn\u2019t seek the family\u2019s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.\n\nIn December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.\n\nEdward Fenno, Ms. Ward\u2019s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward\u2019s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.\n\nThe completed \u201cMurdaugh Murders\u201d documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn\u2019t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker\u2019s legal team but haven\u2019t made public.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to find out who and what we were up against,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMr. Parker said he didn\u2019t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn\u2019t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker\u2019s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.\n\nMr. Roman published <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward\u2019s documentary. Mr. Parker\u2019s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman\u2019s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker\u2019s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.\n\nMr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were \u201cengaged to gather information for news purposes\u201d and not part of a conspiracy.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh\u2019s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer\u2019s double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on this [investigation], do I think \u2018Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn\u2019t have done that?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m proud of the work we did.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. \u201cHere\u2019s a better question,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what?\u2019 Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, \u201cwhich was pretty easy to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThis life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.\n\nThe outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker\u2019s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers say <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.\n\nMr. Donehue\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker\u2019s team in the spring <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,\u201d Ms. Senn said in an email. \u201cI hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.\n\nLayers of connections\n\nSome of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina\u2019s close-knit legal community.\n\nMr. Tinsley,<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden\u2019s ambassador to Slovenia.\n\nMr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group\u2014unrelated to Mr. Parker\u2014including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s team includes some of the state\u2019s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook\u2019s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach\u2019s boyfriend and Mr. Cook\u2019s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.\n\nIn a preview of Mr. Parker\u2019s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj \u201cP.K.\u201d Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker\u2019s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach\u2019s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn\u2019t, according to depositions.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cHe said I\u2019m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of J\u00e4germeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I\u2019m responsible?\u201d\n\nJoe McCulloch, Mr. Cook\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. \u201cMutiny on the Bounty wouldn\u2019t have ended well for anybody,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said.\n\nSouth Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn\u2019t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cVery few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cHis willingness to point the finger isn\u2019t surprising.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.\n\n</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker\u2019s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.\n\n</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was \u201clooking into how the association would fit in\u201d with the coalition\u2019s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn\u2019t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 54 of</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.\n\nState Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn\u2019t benefit the public.\n\nWrite to

On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach\u2019s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.\n\nMr. Parker denies his company\u2019s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.\n\nMr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker\u2019s Kitchen chain <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family\u2019s assets are frozen. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl\u2019s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n</span>\u201cI\u2019ve <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I\u2019m really, really proud of,\u201d Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won\u2019t settle the case, because to settle would be \u201cto have Parker\u2019s name besmirched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should stand up for what\u2019s right. And I\u2019m standing up for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.\n\nThe litigation so far hasn\u2019t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family\u2019s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.\n\n</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker\u2019s team improperly plied a boat passenger\u2019s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker\u2019s team and a crisis communications firm.\n\nMr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker \u201cfor everything he\u2019s got\u201d because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker\u2019s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.\n\n\u201cI can prove everything he did and I\u2019m going to, and he\u2019s going to write me a big check,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said.\n\nPower in county\n\nThe boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh\u2019s alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\n</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor\u2019s, or district attorney\u2019s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family\u2019s close working relationship with local law enforcement.\n\nBefore he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.\n\nBased on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n\nIn the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 7,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The state\u2019s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides \u201cthe background and the motive\u201d for the double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul\u2019s slight build didn\u2019t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother\u2019s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.\n\n\u201cWhen you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don\u2019t even read the information on the ID, it\u2019s apparent what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren\u2019t rigorously followed at Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.\n\n</span>Night of drinking\n\nThe fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span>\n\nPaul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker\u2019s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III\u2019s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.\n\nVideo footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver\u2019s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $49 on</span> his mother\u2019s credit card.\n\nAfter Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.\n\nThe six young people met at Paul\u2019s grandfather\u2019s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast\u2014a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry\u2014at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.\n\nOn the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn\u2019t have running lights. Just <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.\n\nSeveral passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, \u201cscreaming, cussing and saying horrible things,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn\u2019t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.\n\nIt took a week to find Ms. Beach\u2019s body, which was facedown in the <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.\n\nMr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 29,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker\u2019s company.\n\nThe hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.\n\nAlex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach\u2019s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.\n\nThat left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.\n\nThe wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nQuirk in liability law\n\nMr. Parker,<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and \u201cChewy Ice,\u201d which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.\n\nAs Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh\u2019s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh\u2019s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.\n\nMs. Cohen \u201ctakes the driver\u2019s license,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cShe looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.\u201d Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother\u2019s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach\u2019s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn\u2019t follow other company policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got great written policies,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. \u201cIf they did what they said they were going to do, I don\u2019t think this happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.\n\nMs. Cohen isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.\n\nAlcohol-enforcement authorities haven\u2019t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen \u201cdid her due diligence,\u201d by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">State law doesn\u2019t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.\n\n</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018Well, wait a minute. If I\u2019m one-millionth <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% liable</span>?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. \u201cHow does that work? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.\n\nThe law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.\n\nIn December<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nMr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker\u2019s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.\n\nMr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker\u2019s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.\n\nSuper Bowl party\n\nRhett Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.\n\nWhen asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, \u201cNot that she knows of.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he can\u2019t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said \u201cwe sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have directed anybody to break the law,\u201d including by buying alcohol for someone underage.\n\nMr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker\u2019s investigation wouldn\u2019t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn\u2019t the cause of the boat crash. \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Parker\u2019s side was \u201ccollecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Mr. Parker\u2019s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.\n\nThe suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for \u201cMurdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,\u201d a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.\n\nMs. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that \u201cwhoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules\u201d and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.\n\nMr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn\u2019t seek the family\u2019s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.\n\nIn December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.\n\nEdward Fenno, Ms. Ward\u2019s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward\u2019s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.\n\nThe completed \u201cMurdaugh Murders\u201d documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn\u2019t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker\u2019s legal team but haven\u2019t made public.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to find out who and what we were up against,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMr. Parker said he didn\u2019t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn\u2019t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker\u2019s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.\n\nMr. Roman published <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward\u2019s documentary. Mr. Parker\u2019s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman\u2019s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker\u2019s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.\n\nMr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were \u201cengaged to gather information for news purposes\u201d and not part of a conspiracy.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh\u2019s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer\u2019s double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on this [investigation], do I think \u2018Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn\u2019t have done that?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m proud of the work we did.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. \u201cHere\u2019s a better question,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what?\u2019 Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, \u201cwhich was pretty easy to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThis life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.\n\nThe outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker\u2019s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers say <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.\n\nMr. Donehue\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker\u2019s team in the spring <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,\u201d Ms. Senn said in an email. \u201cI hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.\n\nLayers of connections\n\nSome of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina\u2019s close-knit legal community.\n\nMr. Tinsley,<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden\u2019s ambassador to Slovenia.\n\nMr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group\u2014unrelated to Mr. Parker\u2014including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s team includes some of the state\u2019s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook\u2019s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach\u2019s boyfriend and Mr. Cook\u2019s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.\n\nIn a preview of Mr. Parker\u2019s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj \u201cP.K.\u201d Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker\u2019s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach\u2019s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn\u2019t, according to depositions.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cHe said I\u2019m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of J\u00e4germeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I\u2019m responsible?\u201d\n\nJoe McCulloch, Mr. Cook\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. \u201cMutiny on the Bounty wouldn\u2019t have ended well for anybody,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said.\n\nSouth Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn\u2019t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cVery few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cHis willingness to point the finger isn\u2019t surprising.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.\n\n</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker\u2019s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.\n\n</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was \u201clooking into how the association would fit in\u201d with the coalition\u2019s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn\u2019t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 54 of</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.\n\nState Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn\u2019t benefit the public.\n\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the August<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'Teens, Alcohol and a Crash: Case Shakes South Carolina'."}, "15283": {"id": "15283", "text": "<h3>Pig Virus Threatens to Bump Pork Cost</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Disease Threatens to Create More Pain for Food Shoppers\n\nJan.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 6</span>:56 pm ET\n\nCHICAGO\u2014A virus that kills young pigs is roiling the U.S. pork industry, boosting prices in <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $9 billion</span> hog-futures market and threatening to create more pain for food shoppers.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The disease, which has spread to farms <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 22 states</span>, is cutting into pork supplies and prompting some traders and investors to wager that hog prices could set records this year.</span> Lean-hog futures rose to a seven-week high a week ago and are <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 6% since</span> mid-December.\n\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or the PED virus, appeared in the U.S. for the first time in April and has killed thousands of piglets since then.

operates computer platforms for trading on the Singapore and other stock exchanges, failed to disclose important information and misstated facts as basic as the age of its controlling shareholder, according to a review of securities filings.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">On Monday, the company disclosed the SEC probe while also reporting material weaknesses in financial

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2012,</span> known as Reg A+.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The rules allow companies with less <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\"

reporting.\n\n</span>The other nine Reg A+ IPOs that have listed on U.S. exchanges or been issued over the counter have lost more than half their value on average, Dealogic data show.\n\nConcerns about Longfin shine a light on the apparent ease with which IPOs are being approved under the Reg A+ regime, lawyers said. \u201cEveryone understood we were rationalizing the disclosures [required] but nothing as flimsy as what appears to have happened here,\u201d said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look back on Reg A+ and think this was an experiment

is \u201cbased out of Dubai\u201d but intends to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spend 15 days</span> a month in the U.S. He said its sole U.S. office space\u2014a small room with three desks and no computers in a shared-office building in downtown Manhattan that was deserted at 9:30 on a recent weekday morning\u2014is temporary. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Longfin plans to open a bigger office in New York and is hiring more U.S. employees, he added.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Meenavalli rejects any suggestion of financial misconduct, saying short sellers, who have borrowed and sold short <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 15% of</span> the shares available to trade, according to FactSet, are motivated by greed.</span> \u201cThey enter into their own fire,\u201d he said.\n\nA tiny portion of Longfin shares were sold in the Dec.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\"

Ms. Altahawi said Monday she is not a company officer, \u201cso that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nHer father, Andy Altahawi, said she was a secretary. He was <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">issued 2 million</span> Longfin shares for advising on its IPO, according to filings. He said he \u201cmanaged the SEC process as a consultant\u201d and didn\u2019t act as a banker or underwriter.

id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">LFIN 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle took advantage of post-financial-crisis rules designed to create jobs and help young companies go public.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But the financial-technology company, which was valued <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $5.4 billion</span> as recently <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 10 days</span> ago, is now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it failed to disclose important information and left a trail of misstatements behind.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Since Longfin\u2019s December initial public offering, which <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $5.7 million</span>, the company\u2019s price first rose 13-fold, then fell <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 80%,</span> all in less than four months.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">In the run-up to the IPO, the company, which says it operates computer platforms for trading on the Singapore and other stock exchanges, failed to disclose important information and misstated facts as basic as the age of its controlling shareholder, according to a review of securities filings.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">On Monday, the company disclosed the SEC probe while also reporting material weaknesses in financial controls.</span> The company, which said it is cooperating with the probe, said it may not be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The shares closed Monday <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 17% at</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $14.31,</span> above its IPO price <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5.</span>\n\nLongfin went public using a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2012,</span> known as Reg A+.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The rules allow companies with less <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 billion</span> in annual sales to bypass some accounting and disclosure requirements imposed on bigger companies, but they do require accurate reporting.\n\n</span>The other nine Reg A+ IPOs that have listed on U.S. exchanges or been issued over the counter have lost more than half their value on average, Dealogic data show.\n\nConcerns about Longfin shine a light on the apparent ease with which IPOs are being approved under the Reg A+ regime, lawyers said. \u201cEveryone understood we were rationalizing the disclosures [required] but nothing as flimsy as what appears to have happened here,\u201d said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look back on Reg A+ and think this was an experiment that didn\u2019t get managed very well.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The SEC gave Longfin the green light to sell shares based on one month\u2019s audited financial statements, which showed <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 96% of</span> the company\u2019s expenses were paid to a company controlled by Longfin\u2019s owner, Venkat Meenavalli, an Indian entrepreneur.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The company also provided two years of audited statements for a Singaporean subsidiary, which generates most of its revenue.\n\n</span>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nMr. Meenavalli, who says he <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">controls 90% of</span> Longfin shares, told The Wall Street Journal he is \u201cbased out of Dubai\u201d but intends to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spend 15 days</span> a month in the U.S. He said its sole U.S. office space\u2014a small room with three desks and no computers in a shared-office building in downtown Manhattan that was deserted at 9:30 on a recent weekday morning\u2014is temporary. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Longfin plans to open a bigger office in New York and is hiring more U.S. employees, he added.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Meenavalli rejects any suggestion of financial misconduct, saying short sellers, who have borrowed and sold short <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost 15% of</span> the shares available to trade, according to FactSet, are motivated by greed.</span> \u201cThey enter into their own fire,\u201d he said.\n\nA tiny portion of Longfin shares were sold in the Dec.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13 IPO</span>. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Two days later, Longfin disclosed that its chief financial officer and chief operating officer had resigned just before the offering.</span> But on the same day, the company said it had acquired a crypto company, Ziddu.com, from a company controlled by Mr. Meenavalli.\n\nLongfin shares rose more <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1,200% over</span> the next two sessions to a peak value <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $72.38.</span>\n\nMr. Meenavalli <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 48 years</span> old, according to records he confirmed in an interview, although in a <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2017 SEC</span> filing he is listed <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 45.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Described in that filing as \u201ca financial wizard,\u201d his biographies for some earlier companies show him having a computer-science degree from Australia\u2019s Suffield University.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">His Longfin biography lists a diploma in international trade finance from Middlesex University in the U.K.\n\nIn SEC filings, Longfin reported it <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">had 20 employees</span> in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2017.</span></span> The number dropped to two the following month, rose <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 in</span> July, fell to three in November and was reported <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 18 on</span> Monday.

Ms. Altahawi said Monday she is not a company officer, \u201cso that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nHer father, Andy Altahawi, said she was a secretary. He was <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">issued 2 million</span> Longfin shares for advising on its IPO, according to filings.

Her government so far has given little indication of its intentions beyond a statement by Ms. Freeland\u2019s spokesman, Adam Austen, who said the priority was that any deal be \u201cgood for the middle class.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Canada\u2019s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement.\n</span>In France, the environment minister quit during a live radio interview on Tuesday, saying the nation wasn\u2019t doing enough on green issues. And last week in Australia, the prime minister was unseated by a challenger with strong coal-industry connections. Canada, much like Australia, has a powerful energy industry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a challenge from politicians aligned with the oil industry there. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, also has vowed to fight Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to put a price on carbon emission in Canada when it takes effect next year.\n</span>For reasons like these, Canadian environmental activists and United States foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government would have to pick and choose its priorities in the tense coming days, and many say climate change most likely will not make the cut. The Trump administration has opposed any mention of the phrase.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen at this point,\u201d said George David Banks, former international energy and environment adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Banks said neither the Trump administration nor Mexico appeared interested in pursuing climate change in Nafta.\nMr. Trump has said if a compromise cannot be negotiated with Canada he will cut the country out of the deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s not at all clear, though, that Congress \u2014 which must sign off on any trade deal before it takes effect \u2014 would accept that.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">For Canada the risks are both economic and political.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, American exports to Canada have <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 165 percent</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1993,</span> the year before Nafta came into force, and imports from Canada <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 150 percent</span>.</span> If Mr. Trudeau is unable to strike a deal with Mr. Trump he could come off looking weak in the eyes of his public. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But if Mr. Trump imposes <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 percent</span> tariff on automobiles it would hit hard the economic powerhouse province of Ontario.\n</span>The absence of climate change language wouldn\u2019t have an immediate effect on the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions projections from Canada, the United States or Mexico. After all, the current agreement also makes no mention of the need to drive down global warming.\nBut environmentalists say that failing to incorporate a mention would be a missed opportunity to make a statement in support of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 Paris</span> Agreement, which calls on <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 200 nations</span> to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and which did not exist when Nafta was drafted.\n\u201cIt violates the norm that the environment belongs at the negotiating table,\u201d said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe seem to be pushing our trading partners to say, \u2018It\u2019s prosperity or the environment.</span> It\u2019s prosperity or human rights,\u2019\u201d he said, arguing that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as an either-or.\nCanada, for its part, has made climate change a centerpiece of its international agenda. It features prominently in the title, for example, of upcoming discussions at the Group <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 energy</span> discussions slated for Nova Scotia in September.\nBut the Canadian government also has sought out ways to avoid isolating the Trump administration by bringing less antagonizing issues, for instance cleaning plastic from the oceans, to the table.\nWhen it comes to Nafta, the Trudeau government has taken a similarly pliable position. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In August, Ms. Freeland outlined Canada\u2019s vision for what it called \u201cprogressive elements\u201d to any new trilateral trade deal.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The priorities: strengthening labor safeguards and incorporating new chapters on gender equality, indigenous rights and climate change.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">On climate, Mr. Trudeau maintained that he wanted to see the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to move to a low-carbon economy to be written into the new Nafta.\n</span>\u201cWe are certainly looking for a better level playing field across North America on environmental protections,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said last year.\nShortly after that remark, the Canadian foreign affairs minister sent the Trump administration a proposed chapter that included those elements but did not require the United States to accept or embrace the Paris Agreement.\nHowever, late last year the Trump administration declined to accept that language, according to Mr. Banks and a Canadian official who asked not to be identified.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request to discuss the role of that agenda in this week\u2019s talks.\n</span>\u201cThe big question will be to what extent Canada will be interested in going to the wall on climate,\u201d said Dale Marshall, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, a Canadian nonprofit group. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen the rubber hits the road and we\u2019re talking about economic trade, does Canada feel strong enough about those issues to be willing to scuttle a deal?</span> I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Joshua C. Zive, a trade lobbyist who works with energy and utility companies for the firm Bracewell in Washington, said he did not think pushing climate change this week would be in Canada\u2019s negotiating interest.</span> Already, he said, the Trump administration is intent on casting Mr. Trudeau as the scapegoat if a deal falls through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,\u201d Mr. Zive said. \u201cIf it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Mr. Zive for his part questioned the need to incorporate climate change into Nafta, and said the trade deal had always been a fairly technical way to deal with specific products like automobiles.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">If negotiators push for a mention of climate change \u201cjust for symbolic purposes, you\u2019re also importing the symbolic controversy,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is no need to force people to resolve this in an already-complicated and high-stakes trade dispute.\u201d\nMr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration.\n</span>\u201cAs the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States\u2019 competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,\u201d he said.\nCatherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto.\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Zive, a trade lobbyist who works with energy and utility companies for the firm Bracewell in Washington, said he did not think pushing climate change this week would be in Canada\u2019s negotiating interest.</span> Already, he said, the Trump administration is intent on casting Mr. Trudeau as the scapegoat if a deal falls through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,\u201d Mr. Zive said. \u201cIf it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Mr. Zive for his part questioned the need to incorporate climate change into Nafta, and said the trade deal had always been a fairly technical way to deal with specific products like automobiles.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">If negotiators push for a mention of climate change \u201cjust for symbolic purposes, you\u2019re also importing the symbolic controversy,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is no need to force people to resolve this in an already-complicated and high-stakes trade dispute.\u201d\nMr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration.\n</span>\u201cAs the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States\u2019 competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,\u201d he said.\nCatherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto.\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year\u2019s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.\nBut despite the Bengals\u2019 relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\nHe said that he and Duke Tobin, the team\u2019s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.\n\u201cThey certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments \u2014 they have proven that over the last two months,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we\u2019ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.\u201d\nNine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.\nWhen Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.\nMiller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\nBlocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals\u2019 offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.\nBurrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams\u2019 pass rush if the Bengals can\u2019t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ticket prices for this year\u2019s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.\nThe Bengals play in one of the league\u2019s smallest markets, but their fans haven\u2019t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>.

buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s team says yes. <span id=\"9\"

the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner\u2019s content, especially the Turner networks\u2014including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV\u2014are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner\u2019s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.\nA season premiere of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 shows at a Moscow metro station last year.\nPhoto:\nVASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn\u2019t be so willing under AT&T. \u201cWith the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,\u201d it says in filings.\nAT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.\nMr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim\u2019s motives and cited a television interview <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn\u2019t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\nThe two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial.

After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn\u2019t comment on the litigation, then added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.\u201d\nAn AT&T store in Newport Beach, Calif.\nPhoto:\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg NEWS\nThere is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump\u2019s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.\nMr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn\u2019t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $4 billion</span>.\n</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the deal.\nThe Justice Department has been riding a decade\u2019s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.", "displayed_text": "<h3>How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business\n</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government\u2019s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, left, is facing off with U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, right.\nPhoto:\nBloomberg News; Associated Press\nWASHINGTON\u2014The government accuses the company\u2019s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film \u201cCasablanca.\u201d The company likens the government\u2019s case to a shaved Persian cat, \u201cpale and thin.\u201d\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.\nIt could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\nGoogle and\nFacebook Inc.\nOr it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t head-to-head competitors. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They want to combine AT&T\u2019s video-distribution network with Time Warner\u2019s content\u2014from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the NCAA basketball tournament\u2014in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.\n</span>\u201cThis will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,\u201d said Wayne State University law professor\nStephen Calkins,\n\u201cand what the court says will be terribly important.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump with AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephenson during a White House event last year.\nPhoto:\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\nThe case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss\nRandall Stephenson\nand U.S. antitrust chief\nMakan Delrahim.\nMr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.\nMr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal\u2014the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc.,\nHulu and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube. Younger customers increasingly watch video on phones, tablets and laptops.\nThe upheaval has left the pay-TV industry scrambling. Mr. Stephenson made <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $49 billion</span> play for video distribution by acquiring DirecTV, the top U.S. pay-TV satellite service, <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span> He\u2019s now trying to make the company\u2019s wireless and video bundles more attractive to viewers and investors by adding Time Warner news, sports and entertainment assets to the package.\nGiven Mr. Delrahim\u2019s objections, the deal has been pending <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 17 months</span>, creating something of an industry chessboard frozen in time, with competitors uncertain of their next play. Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.\u2019s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with\nWalt Disney Co.\ninstead. (Journal parent company News Corp and\n21st Century Fox\nshare common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as\nComcast\nand\nVerizon Communications Inc.\nand clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.\n</span>Industry Standing\nAT&T and Time Warner already compete with different players in various markets.

buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s team says yes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and \u201cAmerican consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.\u201d\n</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner\u2019s content, especially the Turner networks\u2014including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV\u2014are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner\u2019s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.\nA season premiere of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 shows at a Moscow metro station last year.\nPhoto:\nVASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn\u2019t be so willing under AT&T. \u201cWith the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,\u201d it says in filings.\nAT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs.

Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger\u2019s fate.\nThe Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.\nAT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO\nJeff Bewkes,\nabout what they see as the deal\u2019s benefits.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor\nCarl Shapiro,\nwho served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>.\n</span>Judge Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, is expected to rule in the next few months. The companies extended their merger agreement from <span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 22 to</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 21 to</span> give him more time.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments hang over the case. After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn\u2019t comment on the litigation, then added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.\u201d\nAn AT&T store in Newport Beach, Calif.\nPhoto:\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg NEWS\nThere is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump\u2019s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.\nMr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn\u2019t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $4 billion</span>.\n</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the deal.\nThe Justice Department has been riding a decade\u2019s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon."}, "93420": {"id": "93420", "text": "<h3>Fed to Buy Short-Term Treasurys to Avoid Scarcity Issues in Funding Markets</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Purchases of Treasurys will rebuild

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 9,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> print edition."}, "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html": {"id": "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
