water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.\n</span>Four of <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The country\u2019s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2013 and</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade data.\n</span>New Zealand has become an attractive destination for Chinese companies that want to use the country\u2019s environmentally pristine image to sell bottled water. A few years ago, the country\u2019s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country\u2019s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> Nongfu\u2019s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country\u2019s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.\nThe plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community\u2019s own needs.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,\u201d it said.\n</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand\u2019s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean\u2019s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need to protect our water supply for our community,\u201d said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t the potential for such growth in demand\u2026no one would be panicking.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com\u2019s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.\n\u2014Zhou Wei in Shanghai contributed to this article.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Write to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "<h3>China\u2019s Growing Thirst for Bottled Water Stirs Backlash Overseas</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s Growing Thirst for Bottled Water Stirs Backlash Overseas\nBusinesses pump water from aquifers in New Zealand and Australia, prompting protests\nOn the east coast of New Zealand, a Chinese-owned company has been pumping increasing amounts of water from a local aquifer to quench growing demand among consumers for high-end spring water.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Sales of bottled water by OnePure International Group have grown exponentially since it opened for business five years ago, and most of its products are shipped to China and other parts of Asia.</span> Last year it pumped close <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3 million</span> gallons of spring water from below one of New Zealand\u2019s prime wine-growing districts, to the chagrin of some in the local community.\n\u201cWe are worried it could become problematic,\u201d said Leanne Cotter-Arlidge, who runs a nonprofit in Hawke\u2019s Bay, the region where OnePure and six other bottled-water operations have been tapping aquifers.

water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.\n</span>Four of <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The country\u2019s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2013 and</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade

A few years ago, the country\u2019s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country\u2019s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> Nongfu\u2019s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country\u2019s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.\nThe plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community\u2019s own needs.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,\u201d it said.\n</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand\u2019s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean\u2019s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need to protect our water supply for our community,\u201d said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t the potential for such growth in demand\u2026no one would be panicking.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com\u2019s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.\n\u2014Zhou Wei in Shanghai contributed to this article.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Write to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "24581": {"id": "24581", "text": "<h3>Get Ready to Weather the Price of El Ni\u00f1o</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have confirmed El Ni\u00f1o is back\n\nUpdated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 5,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand\u2014Fears that the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.\n\n</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Ni\u00f1o is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Ni\u00f1o will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Yields for Australian wheat\u2014which <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">comprise 14% of</span> the world\u2019s exports\u2014could fall as much <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Ni\u00f1o event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.\n\n</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">El Ni\u00f1o caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996 and</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.\n\n</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be.

Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.\nMs. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One of Ms. Bass\u2019s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.\n</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.\n[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]\nIn many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party\u2019s candidate for vice president. She talks more about conciliation than confrontation and does not have as many detractors as some of her rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ms. Bass\u2019s advocacy of liberal positions on criminal justice, poverty, housing, foster care and welfare could provide a Biden-Bass ticket a lift with progressive and younger voters.</span> She would arguably be the most liberal politician chosen for vice president since Jimmy Carter tapped Walter F. Mondale as his running mate <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976.</span>\nBut her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.\nIn the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that \u201cthe passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.\u201d Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.\nMs. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro \u201cComandante en Jefe,\u201d a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do that again,\u201d she said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cTalked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn\u2019t have been said.\u201d\nShe said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,\u201d she said.\nChapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.\nIn one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, \u201cJust so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.\u201d\nBack in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office \u2014 not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.\nAnd certainly not for vice president.\n\u201cOh God, no!\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.\u201d\nAs Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.\n\u201cWhen a woman is in a role that\u2019s new, people underestimate,\u201d she said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?\u201d\n\u2018I felt like I had failed a generation\u2019\nAs she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.\nAfter graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.\nWhile elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis \u2014 hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.\n\u201cWhat she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people \u2014 she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,\u201d said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.\nWhat made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.\nFor young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don\u2019t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.\nAt the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991.</span>\nMs. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change \u2014 \u201cfinally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,\u201d she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.\n\u201cI felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn\u2019t gotten change,\u201d she said.\nIn the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.\nOne of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.\n\u201cThe crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,\u201d said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass\u2019s. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cShe knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.\u201d\nMs. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city \u2014 drugs, crime, poverty \u2014 in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.\n</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.\nThen, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly. The outside player was ready to move to the inside.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Crafting a way out of fiscal crisis\nCalifornia was sliding into crisis \u2014 <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $41 billion</span> deficit, larger than the entire budget of many states \u2014 when Ms. Bass was elected speaker in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">For the next two years, she and other legislative leaders struggled with Mr. Schwarzenegger over a punishing package of spending cuts and tax increases to rescue California from its worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.\n</span>It also was a time of a tragedy in her life: <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> her only daughter and her son-in-law were killed in a car crash, an echo of the loss Mr. Biden has experienced; his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972.</span>\n\u201cI had a choice as to whether to go back to work or hide,\u201d Ms. Bass said. \u201cI had to embrace the grief and wrap myself in grief. People don\u2019t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don\u2019t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn\u2019t ask to be a part of.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state\u2019s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,\u201d said Michael C. Genest, who was Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s top financial adviser.</span> \u201cThe major dynamic was that Republicans wanted to cut, Democrats wanted to raise taxes. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">And the reality was we could never cut enough to balance the budget.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">And we could never raise taxes enough to balance the budget.\u201d\n</span>Democrats held a substantial majority in the Assembly and the Senate. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">But passing a budget in California at the time required a vote by two-thirds of members of each chamber.</span> As a result, Republican leaders had significant power in the negotiations.\nJohn A. P\u00e9rez, who succeeded Ms. Bass as speaker, said the dynamic of a minority party holding the votes needed to pass legislation greatly complicated her negotiations with the Senate and governor.\n\u201cBut then she had the hard work of delivering the votes in the caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody goes to office to make cuts on programs they hold near and dear.\u201d\nAntonio R. Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.\n\u201cI thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s unabashedly a progressive, but she\u2019s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.\u201d\nIt was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden \u2014 the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.\n\u201cI would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,\u201d said Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. \u201cShe was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.\n\u201cShe used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. \u201c\u2018Gotta go to Gitmo.\u2019\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.\n</span>\u201cShe was unflappable,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cIt was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.\u201d\nMs. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.\n\u201cIt was very devastating personally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.\u201d\nAs Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today\u2019s brutal political environment?\nThe No.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.\nThat said, Ms. Bass\u2019s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.\n\u201cPeople use the word nice about her, if you notice,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cBut I think a better word is \u2014 she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.\u201d\nMs. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice \u201cas opposed to mean\u201d and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, \u201cNice doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>From Outsider to Insider: Karen Bass\u2019s Unexpected Journey to Power</h3>LOS ANGELES \u2014 <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> as California confronted its most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression, the center of power in the state capital was a tent.</span> It was set up in the courtyard outside the office of Gov.

Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California\u2019s most influential players \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.\nBut not Karen Bass.\nNewly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201c\u2018I guess you probably don\u2019t want to be doing business here,\u2019\u201d the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do.

Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn\u2019t ask to be a part of.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state\u2019s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,\u201d said Michael C. Genest, who was Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s top financial adviser.</span> \u201cThe major dynamic was that Republicans wanted to cut, Democrats wanted to raise taxes. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">And the reality was we could never cut enough to balance the budget.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">And we could never raise taxes enough to balance the budget.\u201d\n</span>Democrats held a substantial majority in the Assembly and the Senate. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">But passing a budget in California at the time required a vote by two-thirds of members of each chamber.</span> As a result, Republican leaders had significant power in the negotiations.\nJohn A. P\u00e9rez, who succeeded Ms. Bass as speaker, said the dynamic of a minority party holding the votes needed to pass legislation greatly complicated her negotiations with the Senate and governor.\n\u201cBut then she had the hard work of delivering the votes in the caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody goes to office to make cuts on programs they hold near and dear.\u201d\nAntonio R. Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.\n\u201cI thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s unabashedly a progressive, but she\u2019s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.\u201d\nIt was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden \u2014 the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.\n\u201cI would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,\u201d said Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. \u201cShe was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.\n\u201cShe used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,\u201d said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. \u201c\u2018Gotta go to Gitmo.\u2019\u201d\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.\n</span>\u201cShe was unflappable,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cIt was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.\u201d\nMs. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.\n\u201cIt was very devastating personally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.\u201d\nAs Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today\u2019s brutal political environment?\nThe No.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.\nThat said, Ms. Bass\u2019s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.\n\u201cPeople use the word nice about her, if you notice,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cBut I think a better word is \u2014 she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.\u201d\nMs. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice \u201cas opposed to mean\u201d and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, \u201cNice doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d"}, "87390": {"id": "87390", "text": "<h3>Fixed mortgage rates are back down to February lows after sharp decline in bond yields and removal of unpopular refinance fee</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Freddie Mac, a federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 80 lenders</span> nationwide to come up with weekly national averages.</span> It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with high credit scores and large down payments.

When Twenge spoke to The Post earlier this month, she speculated that inequality is a major reason.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Income inequality was not much of an issue in the early to mid-1970s, when the <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 1 percent</span> of households earned less <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> of total income in the United States.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But the income gap between <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1 percent</span> and the rest is now at the highest level <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 50 years</span>, driven by everything from the decline of union representation among workers \u2014 unions not only bargain for better pay, but also for workplace protections \u2014 to the offshoring of jobs to increasing CEO pay.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The necessities of life didn\u2019t come down in price to make up for the difference.</span> Instead, they went up. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Adjusted for inflation, the cost of attending college \u2014 either public or private \u2014 more than doubled.</span> The same is true for buying a home. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The price of health care soared so high that the typical employer-provided family plan now costs more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $20,000,</span> and comes with a four-figure deductible.</span> (The typical family only pays <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $6,000 of</span> it, but you can think of that <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">other $14,000 as</span> something you might otherwise see in your paycheck, if you are lucky enough to still have one.) <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">And as two-earner families became the norm, there was a new, backbreaking expense that needed to be accounted for: child care, something that has risen in price such that in a majority of states, it costs more than attending public college.\n</span>What we call a \u201cgood life\u201d got harder and harder for many to afford, leaving many to borrow more and more money \u2014 mortgages, student loans, credit cards, you name it. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But it should surprise no one to discover that struggling with debt is correlated with greater levels of depression.</span> One study, published in Social Science & Medicine <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> found those with student loans are more likely to experience \u201cpoorer psychological functioning.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just that, as research shows, using money to buy our way out of tasks we find unpleasant \u2014 like housekeeping or cooking \u2014 increases our happiness level. It\u2019s also that money buys privilege \u2014 the privilege of health (yes, the wealthy are healthier, and, yes, good health increases happiness), or, say, the privilege of working from home during a pandemic.\nIn the United States, we buy books on happiness, and we download apps that claim they will improve our mood. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Yet all too many of us live in denial of the impacts of income and wealth inequality.</span> When asked, we routinely overestimate the middle and lower classes\u2019 share of the money pie, and we are more likely than those in countries with less inequality to tell pollsters that working hard is key to getting ahead in life.\nIn a society that is all but obsessed with the idea of happiness, I suspect it\u2019s simply too painful to admit that our chances of achieving it are greater when our literal fortunes are greater, too.\nRead more:"}, "13006": {"id": "13006", "text": "<h3>Whatever happened to the expanded NFL playoffs?

The race will be part of the ongoing test of the power of former President Trump's endorsement in primary contests. The candidates are vying to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Richard Burr. The nonpartisan Cook Political report rates the seat as leaning Republican.\nThis is likely to give Mr. Trump\u2019s track record a boost early on in the night.

It could be Democrats from Asheville weighing in on the primary, trying to vote against Mr. Cawthorn for a more establishment-type Republican in the deep-red district. State Sen. Chuck Edwards is the candidate backed by Sen. Thom Tillis and other legislators. Mr. Cawthorn <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">needs 30% plus</span> one vote to avoid a runoff in July.\n\"If there's a runoff, Cawthorn loses,\" Mr. Tillis told reporters on Tuesday.\nAnother test for Trump in North Carolina's open district\nIf Mr. Trump's endorsements hold firm, Mr. Cawthorn could be joined by another 26-year-old in Congress. Former college football player Bo Hines is running in a crowded primary and two conservative groups -- the Club for Growth and a super PAC aligned with the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 have spent more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $2 million</span> to help him.\nHe faces seven other candidates.

Once again, she has become a flag-bearer in the campaign by the Democrats\u2019 liberal wing to overtake the party\u2019s centrists.\nThe race, to replace retiring Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat, is one of several on Tuesday that will signal whether Democratic voters are willing to take a left turn. Others include House races in Oregon and North Carolina.\nMs. Lee, who local officials say would be the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress, has endorsements from members of the \u201csquad\u2019\u2019 -- the most liberal members of the House -- including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.\nCentral bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called \u201creserves.\u201d The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.\nThere is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.\nWhat are reserves for?\nThe main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.\nBut that\u2019s not what really happens. In fact, the first person\u2019s bank reduces the amount in the person\u2019s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person\u2019s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don\u2019t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.\n</span>Where do reserves come from?\nOne way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Whether it wants to pay government workers\u2019 wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government\u2019s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.\nWhere does QE come in?\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The whole point of QE\u2014quantitative easing\u2014was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.\n</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks.

There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.\nCentral bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called \u201creserves.\u201d The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.\nThere is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.\nWhat are reserves for?\nThe main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.\nBut that\u2019s not what really happens. In fact, the first person\u2019s bank reduces the amount in the person\u2019s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person\u2019s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don\u2019t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.\n</span>Where do reserves come from?\nOne way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Whether it wants to pay government workers\u2019 wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government\u2019s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.\nWhere does QE come in?\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The whole point of QE\u2014quantitative easing\u2014was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.\n</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.\n</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer\u2019s bank account disappears.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.\n</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?\nThis is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn\u2019t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.\nNewsletter Sign-up\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">If banks don\u2019t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn\u2019t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn\u2019t yet been identified.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Write to Paul J.

The new agreement is widely expected to raise vehicle costs and create more onerous paperwork requirements, especially for the <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 1 and</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 2 suppliers</span> that feed major automakers such as General Motors and Ford.\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The Trump administration aims to return auto industry jobs to the United States.</span> To encourage that, the new deal stipulates that at <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 75 percent</span> of a vehicle \u2014 vs.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62.5 percent</span> today \u2014 must be produced in the NAFTA region to qualify for duty-free treatment. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Another new provision requires at <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 40 percent</span> of each automobile to be made by workers <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">earning $16 an</span> hour, far higher than Mexico\u2019s average factory wage.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe new deal makes it harder to assemble a car in Mexico and export it to the United States and meet the requirements,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n</span>At the same time, he said, \u201ccarmakers are also less able to buy cheaper parts from European or Asian suppliers.\u201d\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan predicts \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of jobs could return out <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 375,000 lost</span> over the past two decades but says American consumers would see sticker prices increase <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by $470 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $2,200 per</span> vehicle.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">But while the agreement may create some additional U.S. and Canadian jobs in the short run, companies over time could look to cut costs by using more robots in their factories.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe do not anticipate an increase in U.S. auto manufacturing employment.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Rather, it will result in an advance in the use of robotics and automation in Mexico,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at audit firm RSM.\n</span>Such judgments are shared by key Democrats. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Rep. Sander M.

pushing up prices for plane tickets.</span> In many other parts of the world, today\u2019s crude rally is more painful\u2014sparking protests, gas lines and emergency subsidies to quell unrest.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">That is because many consumers outside the U.S. face a double whammy when\u2014like now\u2014the dollar gets stronger at the same time that oil prices rise.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While petroleum is produced all over the globe, when it is sold to refiners and other buyers it is almost always priced in dollars.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">It is, in the words of Brazilian Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia, \u201ca challenging external scenario.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">After Brazil\u2019s military brought an end to a crippling strike by truck drivers over high fuel prices, Mr. Guardia called the oil rally \u201cbrutal\u201d for his country.\n</span>Brazil is among the handful of oil-dependent countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia that have turned to costly fuel subsidies. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Across swaths of Africa, higher fuel costs and weakening local currencies have hit prices for food and electronics.\n</span>Fast-rising crude, on its own, has been pressuring global growth for months. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Swiss bank UBS figures that today\u2019s international crude price, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $75 a</span> barrel, would boost global inflation by more than half a percentage point, compared with <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\"

recent 3\u00bd-year high of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $80,</span> on expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will boost output when it meets this week.</span> Before that retreat, oil was up more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20% this</span> year.\nThere are global winners, along

On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach\u2019s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.\n\nMr. Parker denies his company\u2019s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.\n\nMr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker\u2019s Kitchen chain <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family\u2019s assets are frozen. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl\u2019s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n</span>\u201cI\u2019ve <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I\u2019m really, really proud of,\u201d Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won\u2019t settle the case, because to settle would be \u201cto have Parker\u2019s name besmirched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should stand up for what\u2019s right. And I\u2019m standing up for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.\n\nThe litigation so far hasn\u2019t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family\u2019s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.\n\n</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker\u2019s team improperly plied a boat passenger\u2019s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker\u2019s team and a crisis communications firm.\n\nMr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker \u201cfor everything he\u2019s got\u201d because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker\u2019s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.\n\n\u201cI can prove everything he did and I\u2019m going to, and he\u2019s going to write me a big check,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said.\n\nPower in county\n\nThe boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh\u2019s alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\n</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor\u2019s, or district attorney\u2019s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family\u2019s close working relationship with local law enforcement.\n\nBefore he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.\n\nBased on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n\nIn the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 7,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The state\u2019s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides \u201cthe background and the motive\u201d for the double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul\u2019s slight build didn\u2019t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother\u2019s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.\n\n\u201cWhen you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don\u2019t even read the information on the ID, it\u2019s apparent what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren\u2019t rigorously followed at Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.\n\n</span>Night of drinking\n\nThe fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span>\n\nPaul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker\u2019s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III\u2019s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.\n\nVideo footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver\u2019s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $49 on</span> his mother\u2019s credit card.\n\nAfter Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.\n\nThe six young people met at Paul\u2019s grandfather\u2019s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast\u2014a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry\u2014at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.\n\nOn the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn\u2019t have running lights. Just <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.\n\nSeveral passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, \u201cscreaming, cussing and saying horrible things,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn\u2019t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.\n\nIt took a week to find Ms. Beach\u2019s body, which was facedown in the <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.\n\nMr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 29,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker\u2019s company.\n\nThe hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.\n\nAlex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach\u2019s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.\n\nThat left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.\n\nThe wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nQuirk in liability law\n\nMr. Parker,<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and \u201cChewy Ice,\u201d which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.\n\nAs Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh\u2019s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh\u2019s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.\n\nMs. Cohen \u201ctakes the driver\u2019s license,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cShe looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.\u201d Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother\u2019s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach\u2019s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn\u2019t follow other company policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got great written policies,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. \u201cIf they did what they said they were going to do, I don\u2019t think this happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.\n\nMs. Cohen isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.\n\nAlcohol-enforcement authorities haven\u2019t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen \u201cdid her due diligence,\u201d by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">State law doesn\u2019t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.\n\n</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018Well, wait a minute. If I\u2019m one-millionth <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% liable</span>?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. \u201cHow does that work? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.\n\nThe law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.\n\nIn December<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nMr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker\u2019s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.\n\nMr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker\u2019s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.\n\nSuper Bowl party\n\nRhett Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.\n\nWhen asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, \u201cNot that she knows of.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he can\u2019t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said \u201cwe sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have directed anybody to break the law,\u201d including by buying alcohol for someone underage.\n\nMr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker\u2019s investigation wouldn\u2019t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn\u2019t the cause of the boat crash. \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Parker\u2019s side was \u201ccollecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Mr. Parker\u2019s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.\n\nThe suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for \u201cMurdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,\u201d a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.\n\nMs. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that \u201cwhoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules\u201d and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.\n\nMr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn\u2019t seek the family\u2019s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.\n\nIn December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.\n\nEdward Fenno, Ms. Ward\u2019s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward\u2019s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.\n\nThe completed \u201cMurdaugh Murders\u201d documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn\u2019t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker\u2019s legal team but haven\u2019t made public.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to find out who and what we were up against,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMr. Parker said he didn\u2019t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn\u2019t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker\u2019s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.\n\nMr. Roman published <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward\u2019s documentary. Mr. Parker\u2019s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman\u2019s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker\u2019s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.\n\nMr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were \u201cengaged to gather information for news purposes\u201d and not part of a conspiracy.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh\u2019s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer\u2019s double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on this [investigation], do I think \u2018Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn\u2019t have done that?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m proud of the work we did.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. \u201cHere\u2019s a better question,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what?\u2019 Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, \u201cwhich was pretty easy to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThis life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.\n\nThe outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker\u2019s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers say <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.\n\nMr. Donehue\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker\u2019s team in the spring <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,\u201d Ms. Senn said in an email. \u201cI hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.\n\nLayers of connections\n\nSome of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina\u2019s close-knit legal community.\n\nMr. Tinsley,<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden\u2019s ambassador to Slovenia.\n\nMr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group\u2014unrelated to Mr. Parker\u2014including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s team includes some of the state\u2019s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook\u2019s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach\u2019s boyfriend and Mr. Cook\u2019s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.\n\nIn a preview of Mr. Parker\u2019s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj \u201cP.K.\u201d Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker\u2019s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach\u2019s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn\u2019t, according to depositions.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cHe said I\u2019m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of J\u00e4germeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I\u2019m responsible?\u201d\n\nJoe McCulloch, Mr. Cook\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. \u201cMutiny on the Bounty wouldn\u2019t have ended well for anybody,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said.\n\nSouth Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn\u2019t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cVery few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cHis willingness to point the finger isn\u2019t surprising.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.\n\n</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker\u2019s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.\n\n</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was \u201clooking into how the association would fit in\u201d with the coalition\u2019s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn\u2019t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 54 of</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.\n\nState Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn\u2019t benefit the public.\n\nWrite to

On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach\u2019s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.\n\nMr. Parker denies his company\u2019s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.\n\nMr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker\u2019s Kitchen chain <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family\u2019s assets are frozen. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl\u2019s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n</span>\u201cI\u2019ve <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I\u2019m really, really proud of,\u201d Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won\u2019t settle the case, because to settle would be \u201cto have Parker\u2019s name besmirched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should stand up for what\u2019s right. And I\u2019m standing up for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.\n\nThe litigation so far hasn\u2019t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family\u2019s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.\n\n</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker\u2019s team improperly plied a boat passenger\u2019s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker\u2019s team and a crisis communications firm.\n\nMr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker \u201cfor everything he\u2019s got\u201d because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker\u2019s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.\n\n\u201cI can prove everything he did and I\u2019m going to, and he\u2019s going to write me a big check,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said.\n\nPower in county\n\nThe boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh\u2019s alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\n</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor\u2019s, or district attorney\u2019s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family\u2019s close working relationship with local law enforcement.\n\nBefore he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.\n\nBased on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n\nIn the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 7,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The state\u2019s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides \u201cthe background and the motive\u201d for the double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul\u2019s slight build didn\u2019t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother\u2019s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.\n\n\u201cWhen you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don\u2019t even read the information on the ID, it\u2019s apparent what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren\u2019t rigorously followed at Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.\n\n</span>Night of drinking\n\nThe fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span>\n\nPaul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker\u2019s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III\u2019s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.\n\nVideo footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver\u2019s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $49 on</span> his mother\u2019s credit card.\n\nAfter Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.\n\nThe six young people met at Paul\u2019s grandfather\u2019s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast\u2014a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry\u2014at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.\n\nOn the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn\u2019t have running lights. Just <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.\n\nSeveral passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, \u201cscreaming, cussing and saying horrible things,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn\u2019t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.\n\nIt took a week to find Ms. Beach\u2019s body, which was facedown in the <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.\n\nMr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 29,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker\u2019s company.\n\nThe hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.\n\nAlex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach\u2019s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.\n\nThat left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.\n\nThe wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nQuirk in liability law\n\nMr. Parker,<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and \u201cChewy Ice,\u201d which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.\n\nAs Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh\u2019s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh\u2019s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.\n\nMs. Cohen \u201ctakes the driver\u2019s license,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cShe looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.\u201d Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother\u2019s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach\u2019s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn\u2019t follow other company policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got great written policies,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. \u201cIf they did what they said they were going to do, I don\u2019t think this happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.\n\nMs. Cohen isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.\n\nAlcohol-enforcement authorities haven\u2019t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen \u201cdid her due diligence,\u201d by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">State law doesn\u2019t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.\n\n</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018Well, wait a minute. If I\u2019m one-millionth <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% liable</span>?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. \u201cHow does that work? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.\n\nThe law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.\n\nIn December<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nMr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker\u2019s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.\n\nMr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker\u2019s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.\n\nSuper Bowl party\n\nRhett Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.\n\nWhen asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, \u201cNot that she knows of.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he can\u2019t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said \u201cwe sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have directed anybody to break the law,\u201d including by buying alcohol for someone underage.\n\nMr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker\u2019s investigation wouldn\u2019t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn\u2019t the cause of the boat crash. \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Parker\u2019s side was \u201ccollecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Mr. Parker\u2019s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.\n\nThe suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for \u201cMurdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,\u201d a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.\n\nMs. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that \u201cwhoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules\u201d and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.\n\nMr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn\u2019t seek the family\u2019s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.\n\nIn December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.\n\nEdward Fenno, Ms. Ward\u2019s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward\u2019s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.\n\nThe completed \u201cMurdaugh Murders\u201d documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn\u2019t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker\u2019s legal team but haven\u2019t made public.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to find out who and what we were up against,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMr. Parker said he didn\u2019t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn\u2019t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker\u2019s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.\n\nMr. Roman published <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward\u2019s documentary. Mr. Parker\u2019s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman\u2019s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker\u2019s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.\n\nMr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were \u201cengaged to gather information for news purposes\u201d and not part of a conspiracy.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh\u2019s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer\u2019s double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on this [investigation], do I think \u2018Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn\u2019t have done that?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m proud of the work we did.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. \u201cHere\u2019s a better question,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what?\u2019 Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, \u201cwhich was pretty easy to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThis life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.\n\nThe outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker\u2019s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers say <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.\n\nMr. Donehue\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker\u2019s team in the spring <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,\u201d Ms. Senn said in an email. \u201cI hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.\n\nLayers of connections\n\nSome of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina\u2019s close-knit legal community.\n\nMr. Tinsley,<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden\u2019s ambassador to Slovenia.\n\nMr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group\u2014unrelated to Mr. Parker\u2014including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s team includes some of the state\u2019s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook\u2019s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach\u2019s boyfriend and Mr. Cook\u2019s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.\n\nIn a preview of Mr. Parker\u2019s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj \u201cP.K.\u201d Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker\u2019s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach\u2019s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn\u2019t, according to depositions.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cHe said I\u2019m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of J\u00e4germeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I\u2019m responsible?\u201d\n\nJoe McCulloch, Mr. Cook\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive.

His approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">First, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Despite his declaration that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d and his recent boast that he is a \u201cTariff Man,\u201d Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.\n</span>Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his advisers that Mr. Xi is someone with whom he can cut a big deal, according to people who have spoken with the president. On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi to discuss the status of talks, tweeting afterward that good progress was being made. \u201cDeal is moving along very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nThe administration has tried to force China to change its ways with stiff tariffs <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $250 billion</span> worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and threats of additional levies on <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $267 billion</span> worth of goods. China has responded with its own tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods. But over a steak dinner during the Group <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 summit</span> meeting in Argentina, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump agreed to a 90-day truce and to work toward an agreement that Mr. Trump said could lead to \u201cone of the largest deals ever made.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s not some subtle shift; Trump has flipped since September,\u201d said Derek Scissors, who studies China\u2019s economy for the American Enterprise Institute.</span> \u201cHe went from saying how he was going to slap tariffs on everything to all this talk about making the greatest deal ever.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer \u2014 whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February \u2014 has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting \u201cempty promises\u201d like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Lighthizer,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71,</span> is pushing for substantive changes, such as forcing China to end its practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.</span> But <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 40 years</span> of dealing with China and watching it dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs in order to win true concessions.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Lighthizer senses that anyone \u2014 even Mr. Trump \u2014 might be going a little soft on China, he opens a paper-clipped manila folder he totes around and brandishes a single-page, easy-reading chart that lists decades of failed trade negotiations with Beijing, according to administration officials.\n</span>\u201cBob\u2019s attitude toward China is very simple. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">He wants them to surrender,\u201d said William A. Reinsch, a former federal trade official who met him three decades ago when Mr. Lighthizer was a young aide for former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.</span> \u201cHis negotiating strategy is simple too. He basically gives them a list of things he wants them to do and says, \u2018Fix it now.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Lighthizer last month to lead the talks initially spooked markets, which viewed the China skeptic\u2019s appointment as an ominous sign. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">It also annoyed Chinese officials, who had been talking with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a more moderate voice on trade and the primary point of contact for Liu He, China\u2019s top trade negotiator.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Mnuchin has urged the president to avoid a protracted trade war, even if that entails reaching an interim agreement that leaves some issues unresolved.\n</span>Mr. Mnuchin, who attended the G-20 dinner, helped Mr. Trump craft an upbeat assessment declaring the Buenos Aires meeting \u201chighly successful\u201d in the presidential limousine back to the airport, according to a senior administration official.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The disparate views among Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers have prompted sparring \u2014 both publicly and behind the scenes.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2017,</span> when Mr. Lighthizer grew concerned that Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, were wading too far into China matters, he enlisted Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary at the time, to persuade Mr. Trump to draft a document designating Mr. Lighthizer the main trade emissary to China, according to a person who has seen the letter.</span> Mr. Lighthizer has never used the document to defend his position, the person said, but he considers it an insurance policy of sorts.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">During an Oval Office meeting with the trade team the fall <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> Mr. Lighthizer accused Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the former National Economic Council director, of bad-mouthing him to free-trade Republican senators.\n</span>The argument grew so heated that the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, quickly pulled the combatants into the nearby Roosevelt Room and away from the president, where the argument raged on for a few more minutes, according to two witnesses.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, disputed the account.\n</span>Mr. Lighthizer has since worked to increase his own face time with Mr. Trump. He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president\u2019s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">own $2.3 million</span> waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.\nHe used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China\u2019s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing\u2019s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Mr. Scissors said.\nThose who know Mr. Lighthizer say he will try to force concessions through a combination of pressure tactics, like tariffs, and public condemnation. Mr. Lighthizer \u2014 who described his own negotiating style as \u201cknowing where the leverage is\u201d during <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1984 interview</span> \u2014 typically presents few specific demands during initial talks while publicly bashing efforts by the other side.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He used that approach during recent talks with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, criticizing foreign counterparts as intransigent and characterizing complaints by American businesses as pure greed.\n</span>Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s unsparing view of China comes, in part, from his childhood in Ashtabula, Ohio, an industrial and shipping town on the Great Lakes hit by the offshoring of steel and chemical production. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">For much of his career, Mr. Lighthizer was a lonely protectionist voice in a Republican Party dominated by free traders, alternating between jobs in government and a lucrative private law career representing large American corporations like United States Steel in trade cases against China.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Mr. Lighthizer found his way into Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit through his work in the steel industry, where he gained prominence by filing lawsuits accusing Japan and China of dumping metals into the United States, in violation of trade laws.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> Mr. Lighthizer caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with an opinion piece in The Washington Times, in which he defended Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to China as consistent with conservative ideology and compared the future president to Republican icons like Ronald Reagan.\nTaciturn in public and self-deprecating in private, Mr. Lighthizer sees himself as a serious player on the world stage: Two recent guests to Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s Georgetown townhouse were greeted by the stern visage of their host staring down at them from an oil portrait on the wall.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The trade adviser is guarded around Mr. Trump, often waiting until the end of meetings to make his points and quietly nudging the president away from actions he views as counterproductive, current and former officials said.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">That was the case in mid-2017 when he cautioned the president against withdrawing unilaterally from the World Trade Organization, adding for emphasis, \u201cAnd I hate the W.T.O. as much as anybody.\u201d\n</span>He does not always get his way. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In the wake of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this fall, Mr. Lighthizer urged Mr. Trump to consider easing steel and aluminum tariffs on those countries and replacing them with less burdensome quotas.</span> Mr. Trump rejected his plan, according to negotiators from all three countries.\nA poker-faced Mr. Lighthizer broke the news to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts by declaring the proposal was inoperative, one of the officials said.\nThe president also ignored Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s advice in early December when he announced that he intended to begin the six-month process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta in order to pressure House Democrats into passing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">That threat undermined months of quiet negotiations between Mr. Lighthizer, labor groups and Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to try to win their support for the new trade deal.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has yet to follow through on his threat, and Mr. Lighthizer continues trying to work with Democrats to get the new trade deal approved.\n</span>\u201cBob is trying to provide stability and focus in a completely chaotic environment,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Bob, but I am certain he is frustrated. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">How could you not be frustrated as the U.S. trade representative for a president who knows what his gut thinks but hasn\u2019t put much of his brains into trade?\u201d</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>As China Talks Begin, Trump\u2019s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering</h3>WASHINGTON \u2014 <span id=\"0\"
