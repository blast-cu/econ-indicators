WeWorking Class America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful and Miserable The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers’ Rights</span> Why Aren’t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?
What happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents’ home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big — it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job — any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald’s, if it came to that.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon’s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.
Given a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? “It seemed kind of rude,” Hirasuna said. “Like, ‘Hey, here I am!’ ” A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. “It was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,” he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity — to do work he might actually like — in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.
Offices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.
And then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision — hover outside the boss’s office? don’t hover? — poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“When it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,” said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> “It’s moving in the dark without a flashlight.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show “Survivor.”</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as “autistic.” Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as “on the spectrum” or as “a person with autism.” “Just don’t call me late for dinner,” said one who did not have a preference.)
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues’ needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.
</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, “essentially to see if I can break it,” as Hirasuna put it.
<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children’s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, “that they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon’s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist’s start-up.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon’s marketing material names “pattern recognition” and “uncompromised honesty” as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations — even stereotypes — in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon’s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. “I realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don’t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,” he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? “ ‘That’s autism!’ ” Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. “ ‘O.K. — that’s what we expected!’ ”
One morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon’s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. “Oh, it drives my husband crazy, too,” she assured him. “But it helps me concentrate.” <span id=""20"" class=""red"">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)
</span>Musayaf’s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. “O.K.,” he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.
Later, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. “I knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,” she wrote. “We understand and respect each other.”
Musayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague’s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.
Musayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla’s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. “Look,” he said, “there is no correct way, or incorrect.” He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.
A culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam’s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.
</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But before she was put in charge of Auticon’s United States business in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2018,</span> she hadn’t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.
That Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening — they had been told to clear their desks — but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.
Another co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark’s founder), who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair would later prove popular — some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them — but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man’s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam’s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it’s pizza).
“People with my type of disorder, it’s not that we don’t have emotion,” Gadson said. “It’s that we have too much emotion. We can’t push that stuff back.”
Beam, as she started to understand the office’s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees’ boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems — a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum — call in to explain, in great detail, why they won’t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“You know, some employers would say to someone like that, ‘I’m done,’ ”</span> Beam said. “But I’m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.”
Beam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> “It was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious — I could see it — that he wasn’t able to process what it was he was being told,” she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">“I kind of like it here,” Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn’t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: “They accept me as I am.”
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.
</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. “Horus,” said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: “Halberd.” <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett’s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.
</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party — once. “It felt really claustrophobic,” he said. “I was like, O.K., I think I’ve had enough.” He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work — fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world’s worst meeting — interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.
The next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague — the one who had bristled in the meeting — that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: “I prefer this number:<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.87298334621.</span>” The note made her laugh, even though she wasn’t sure what it meant. “It’s the square root <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15,</span>” he told her. She burst out laughing again.
The conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. ”Don’t they look miserable?” Beam said. Kayla was indignant. “You know that at least some of them are introverts,” she said. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">It was almost as if they didn’t think their employees had feelings.

Clinton attacks the GOP on climate change. But her plan has a glaring gap.
HILLARY CLINTON has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago — and it has a glaring gap.
Ms. Clinton’s proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn’t taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy.</span> On this, Ms. Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.
Ms. Clinton’s strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Obama’s greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Mr. Obama’s promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 26 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 28 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> increase renewables <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> of the power grid <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2030.</span> Ms. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2027,</span> with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.
To get there, Ms. Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions, a concept that resembles Mr. Obama’s Race to the Top education initiative. She would invest in more energy research and development. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She would also use the tax code to subsidize investment in or electricity production from renewable energy sources, extending and reforming the renewables tax subsidies already on the books.
</span>Yet it’s curious that Ms. Clinton didn’t offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them. Others could include nuclear power or careful use of natural gas in the medium term. What matters is not how the country slashes its emissions but that it does so — and as cheaply as possible.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country’s complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions.</span> This wouldn’t tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Market behavior would therefore become much more rational: Businesses and consumers would use electricity more carefully; the market appeal of low-carbon energy technologies would reflect their real value; government planners would have less influence over the country’s energy future.
</span>The drawbacks are all political. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The term “carbon tax” doesn’t play well.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Cap and trade” has been smeared.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet Ms. Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.</span> Giving the policy its due would hardly be the most politically unrealistic campaign proposal a candidate has offered. Yet it would be among the most reasonable.
Clinton grandee John Podesta assures that “these proposals are only the first steps in an ambitious climate and energy strategy.” We hope so.",,6,,,,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.
The final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.
The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.
In the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC’s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.
Kickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time — 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there’s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl’s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.
Outside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L’Équipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).
After the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year’s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.
Local sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.
Now, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.
“When you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,” Demoff said.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“You get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.”
Temperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.
It’s been <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.
Across the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.
SoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.
Here are where temperature records were broken in 2021:
A common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, has been that this year’s Super Bowl is “just another game.”
“Obviously it’s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,” Burrow said after Friday’s practice, the last of the season.
Their opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year’s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.
But despite the Bengals’ relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
He said that he and Duke Tobin, the team’s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.
“They certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments — they have proven that over the last two months,” Taylor said. “It’s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we’ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.”
Nine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.
When Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.
Miller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.
Blocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals’ offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.
Burrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams’ pass rush if the Bengals can’t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ticket prices for this year’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.
The Bengals play in one of the league’s smallest markets, but their fans haven’t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).
While the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.
All fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.
Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor “mega” events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.
Away from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.
“You’re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,” Sikka said. “You should test to go to your Super Bowl party.”",,6,,,,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest: Trump confirms NRA meeting appearance Friday, when group will lay out midterm strategyReturn to menu
Former president Donald Trump said Wednesday that he plans to headline a forum at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting this Friday, during which the organization will lay out its strategy for this year’s midterm elections.
The gathering will be held in Houston — about a four-hour drive from Uvalde, Tex., where a gunman killed at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 children</span> and two teachers Tuesday.
In a post shared on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said he will keep his “longtime commitment to speak in Texas at the NRA Convention and deliver an important address to America.”
“America needs real solutions and real leadership in this moment, not politicians and partisanship,” Trump said.
His speech Friday will be preceded by a meeting in which the NRA will lay out its strategy for this year’s midterm elections. The association’s political staff will give an update to members on its plan for “the midterm election fight ahead to protect our rights.”
While the NRA’s influence in Washington has diminished amid a bankruptcy trial — the organization <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $11 million</span> in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 midterm</span> races, far less than what it spent <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 </span>— the association has continued spending to oppose Biden’s gun-control agenda.
The annual forum is also slated to include Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem — both Republicans who face reelection races in November.
Trump’s speech will be open to all NRA members — but they can’t bring firearms or firearm accessories into the room, the organization warned.
Take a look: Walker ad seeks to debunk Warnock claim that he’ll work with both partiesReturn to menu
Hershel Walker, the former football star who is now the Republican Senate nominee in Georgia, is out with his first general-election ad — and it’s all about his Democratic opponent, Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.). The ad, in which Walker does not appear, seeks to debunk a Warnock claim that he’s willing to work with both Democrats and Republicans.
The 30-second spot portends a largely negative general-election campaign. Earlier Wednesday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee distributed background materials to reporters that the organization said demonstrate “outright lies and a long trail of dishonest, fraudulent schemes” from Walker.

Analysis: Just how bad was Perdue’s loss in Georgia?Return to menu
Former U.S. senator David Perdue lost Georgia’s Republican primary for governor to incumbent Brian Kemp by a <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">stunning 52 points</span>.
Just how bad is that? The Post’s Aaron Blake offers an assessment:
The scale of that loss shouldn’t be undersold. This is a recent former statewide officeholder — one <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whose 2014 outsider</span> Senate campaign was viewed as something of a model for the party. … While Perdue’s failed comeback is surely among the worst in recent history, losing such a bid is hardly without precedent.Just earlier this month, former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) attempted one in the state’s open Senate race after losing reelection <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> He lost to Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) by more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 points</span>, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taking 25 percent</span> of the vote.In Nevada, former senator Dean Heller (R), who lost reelection <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span> is running for governor. It looks as though he, too, won’t win his party’s nomination; he trails by double digits in early polls, the most recent of which pegged him at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 percent</span> of the vote. (The primary is in three weeks.)
Aaron notes, though, that it’s difficult to find other comeback candidates who fared so poorly in their party’s primaries in recent years. And it’s more common for comeback candidates to lose general elections rather than primaries.

The latest: Still no call in a tight Texas congressional raceReturn to menu
The congressional primary runoff in South Texas pitting Rep. Henry Cuellar against immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros remains uncalled Wednesday morning with <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 175 votes</span> separating the two Democratic contenders and ballots remaining to be tallied.
The lack of a call by the Associated Press did not deter Cuellar from issuing a statement claiming victory early Wednesday morning.
“The results are in, all the votes have been tallied,” Cuellar said in a statement, even though the AP totals <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">showed 2 percent</span> of the vote still outstanding.
Cuellar congratulated Cisneros on a “hard-fought” race and thanked, among others, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), who traveled to Texas late in the campaign for appearances on the trail with him.
The race has been closely watched in part because of Cuellar’s opposition to abortion rights.
Analysis: What a Trump endorsement is worthReturn to menu
In Tuesday’s primaries in Georgia, David Perdue, the candidate Trump endorsed for governor, netted <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 21 percent</span> of the vote, while Rep.

In assessing how Trump-backed candidates have fared elsewhere, The Post’s Aaron Blake writes:
While Perdue is now the low water mark for Trump-backed candidates, Hice’s showing aligns with the others. Nebraska governor candidate Charles Herbster:<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span>. Idaho gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov.

Take a look: Georgia losses ding Trump’s win rate with non-incumbentsReturn to menu
The large majority of candidates endorsed by former president Donald Trump are incumbents and have won their primaries so far.
His success rate with non-incumbents is not as good, dropping <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 70 percent</span> after several lost on Tuesday in Georgia.
The Post’s Youjin Shin, Courtney Beesch and Anu Narayanswamy have an ongoing tally of Trump’s endorsed candidates and how they are doing. They write:
Overall, Trump’s endorsements for state-level offices such as governor and secretary of state are his most clear effort to punish officials he wrongly believes delivered <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> to Joe Biden. His endorsement of a candidate is most often tied to their efforts to confirm election fraud in states he continues to falsely claim were stolen from him.That was especially so in Georgia. Trump had thrown his support behind former senator David Perdue, who lost, claiming incumbent governor Brian Kemp, “allowed massive Election Fraud to take place.” Trump also failed to back winners in statewide secretary of state, attorney general and insurance commissioner races.

Noted: In Ga., Rep. McBath’s victory celebration turns somberReturn to menu
Instead of delivering a joyous victory speech Tuesday night, Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) found herself reliving the pain of losing her teenage son a decade ago to gun violence and yet again mourning the murder of even more children, while forcefully criticizing senators for refusing to take up gun-control legislation that recently passed in the House.
The Post’s Marianna Sotomayor and Mark Shavin report that for those gathered in a hotel ballroom near Atlanta to celebrate McBath’s decisive primary win over Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.), the upbeat party turned into a vigil of sorts when McBath spoke of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 19 children</span> and two teachers killed earlier in the day at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex. They write:
Combating gun violence is the reason McBath says she got into politics — but in her two terms in Congress, little has been accomplished, and mass shootings continue.“Across the country, from Uvalde to Sandy Hook, from Charleston to Buffalo, the violence that took my son is being replayed with casual callousness and despicable frequency,” she said, naming just a few of the mass shootings that have occurred since her son was killed. “We are better than this. We have to be better than this.”
McBath’s 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was killed <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 after</span> he was confronted by Michael Dunn, a White man, for playing loud music in his parked car at a Jacksonville, Fla., gas station. Dunn, who said he felt threatened, fired several shots into the car, killing Davis. He was convicted of first-degree murder two years later and sentenced to life without parole.
After her son’s death, McBath became a fierce gun-control activist.

On our radar: Trump plans vendetta tour stop against Cheney in WyomingReturn to menu
Former president Donald Trump, who failed Tuesday to knock off several Republican candidates in Georgia, plans to head to Wyoming on Saturday to campaign in another race driven by a vendetta.
Trump is seeking to defeat Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who voted for his impeachment on the charge of incitement of an insurrection and now serves as vice chair of the House select committee investigating what transpired at the Capitol on Jan.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span></span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span>
Trump has planned a fundraiser and a “Save America Rally” on Saturday afternoon in Casper to benefit Harriet Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member who is challenging Cheney.
Cheney has appeared undeterred by the challenge.
She issued a plea Sunday for Americans to stand up in a bipartisan fashion to the actions of Trump, who she said is the only U.S. president who did not live up to a “sacred obligation to defend the peaceful transfer of power.”
Cheney’s comment came after she accepted a Profile In Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation for seeking to hold Trump accountable in the wake of the insurrection, despite retaliatory actions from members of her own party.
Noted: A Trump-backed candidate for attorney general also lost in GeorgiaReturn to menu
Georgia state Attorney General Chris Carr (R) easily prevailed on Tuesday against John Gordon, a GOP primary challenger backed by former president Donald Trump who campaigned on Trump’s baseless allegations of widespread election fraud.
Trump-backed candidates also lost in the state’s GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state, both by sizable margins, as well, and in the race for insurance commissioner.
Carr was <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leading 74 percent</span></span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 26 percent</span>, <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 95 percent</span> of the votes tallied.

Gordon had called for an investigation into <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span>, while Carr said there was no need to investigate the losses of Trump and Georgia’s two GOP Senate candidates.
In November, Carr will face Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan. She also easily prevailed in her Democratic primary on Tuesday.
Analysis: In some ways, Raffensperger’s victory was the biggest surpriseReturn to menu
In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) was expected to prevail over challenger David Perdue, the former U.S. senator who was recruited to run by former president Donald Trump. The race turned into a rout. Kemp was <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leading 74 percent</span></span> <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 22 percent</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 96 percent</span> of the votes tallied.
In some ways, however, Tuesday’s biggest surprise in Georgia was Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who had been left for political dead after more directly repudiating Trump’s false voter-fraud claims, The Post’s Aaron Blake says.
Aaron writes:
Raffensperger, unlike many Republicans who denounce Trump, actually ran for reelection. He got a high-profile, election-truther opponent in Rep. Jody Hice. And it looks like he just might survive after all.Raffensperger led <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Hice 52 percent</span> <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 33 percent</span> with <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 96 percent</span> of the vote in, narrowly avoiding a runoff with Hice.

On our radar: Kemp’s victory sets up rematch with Abrams in NovemberReturn to menu
Tuesday’s GOP primary victory by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) sets up a rematch in November with Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state House minority leader and voting-rights activist who was unopposed on the Democratic side.
Abrams, who narrowly lost to Kemp <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span> is vying to become the first Black female governor in the country.
Kemp won on Tuesday against former U.S. senator David Perdue, who was recruited to challenge Kemp by former president Donald Trump, who was angry that Kemp didn’t do more to overturn <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> election results in the state. Throughout the race, Perdue echoed Trump’s baseless claims of widespread election fraud.
During remarks to supporters on Tuesday night, Kemp didn’t mention Trump by name but instead bragged about his record of reopening Georgia during the pandemic and attacked Abrams.
“Georgia would be just one variant away from lockdowns, government mandates, schools shuttered and businesses closed,” he said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Abrams has campaigned on a pledge to expand Medicaid to all adults in the state and, even before Tuesday’s results, been highly critical of Kemp’s leadership, including his claim that Georgia had become the best state in which to do business.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I am tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live,” Abrams said over the weekend.</span> “Let me contextualize. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">When you’re No.<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48 for</span> mental health, when you’re No.<span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 for</span> maternal mortality, when you have an incarceration rate that’s on the rise and wages that are on the decline, then you are not the No.<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 place</span> to live.”</span>",,6,,,,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,63003,"<h3>Tenants Stay Current on Rent, for Now</h3>Since April, landlords have looked to the first of the month fearing that tenants will stop paying their rent. For the most part, that has not happened. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Despite <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 14.7 percent</span> unemployment rate and millions of new jobless claims each week, collections are only slightly below where they were last year, when the economy was booming.
</span>How can this be? The answer is a little negotiation and a lot of government money. <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2 trillion</span> CARES Act, which backstopped household finances with stimulus checks and extended unemployment benefits, has kept a surprising number of tenants current on their monthly balances.</span> At the same time, many landlords have reduced rents or are forgiving overdue payments in full or in part.
The trend cannot continue without a swift and robust recovery, which is becoming increasingly unlikely, or without another big injection of government money, which Senate Republicans say is not happening anytime soon. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">American households were struggling with rent long before the economy went into free fall, and there are signs — from an increase in partial payments to surveys that show many tenants are putting rent on their credit cards and struggling to pay for essentials like food — that this pressure is building.
</span>There are cracks under the surface.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">When the coronavirus outbreak started shutting down the economy in March, there was widespread fear that millions of tenants would fall behind on their monthly bills.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Renters were already struggling with housing costs, with a quarter of tenant households paying more than half their before-tax income on rent and utilities, and the loss of jobs and hours seemed almost certain to worsen those troubles.
</span>Much of the available data has told a different story. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In April, the National Multifamily Housing Council started releasing weekly rent tallies, and aside from a substantial dip in the first week, the rates have been only slightly below where they were last year.</span> Through <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 20,</span> landlords in the council's survey had <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collected 90.8 percent</span> of rents, compared <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 93 percent</span> a year earlier. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A similar story has played out in state surveys and earnings reports from real estate investment trusts like Mid-America Apartment Company and Equity Residential.
</span>But many of these numbers skew toward higher-end buildings. Other surveys show that buildings with poorer tenants have lower collection rates. Meantime, deferrals and partial payments appear to be increasing: Apartment List, a rental listing service, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">said 31 percent</span> of respondents failed to make the full May payment on time, up from a quarter the month before. Hoping for a swift recovery, many landlords are telling tenants they can pay later, knowing this often won’t happen.
“Landlords and renters will share in the pain,” said John Pawlowski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We just don’t know what the sharing balance will look like.”
New Story, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization that builds and finances affordable housing, recently <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $2 million</span> to help renters struggling to make their bills because of coronavirus-related job losses.</span> Alexandria Lafci, a founder of the organization and its chief operating officer, has spent the last few weeks calling landlords to haggle on behalf of tenants.
“I <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 21 properties</span> and got eight yeses with an average <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 percent</span> off,” she said. Only three landlords rejected any accommodation, with the rest agreeing to arrangements like lower payments for the next three months or shaving down past-due balances to give tenants a break without lowering their advertised rents.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Smaller landlords and affordable housing are in trouble.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Rental housing is a fragmented business, with purveyors ranging from publicly traded corporations that own tens of thousands of units to operators of only one or two.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">And falling rent collections are more likely to affect smaller landlords, who tend to have a limited financial cushion and less capacity to borrow.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">These landlords play an important role in the housing system — especially for lower-income tenants.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Individual investors own about half the supply of low-cost units, and many are what housing advocates call “naturally occurring affordable housing,” or homes and apartments that carry below-market rents even without a subsidy, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.</span> These units, which overwhelmingly consist of small apartment buildings and single-family homes, are also more likely to have tenants affected by the coronavirus, with more than half of renters in the hardest-hit occupations living in single-family homes and duplexes, according to the center.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Naturally occurring affordable housing is often overlooked, but these units are crucial.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Government housing programs like <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 rental</span> vouchers and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit do not come close to satisfying the demand for lower-cost housing.</span> This is why cities have yearslong lists for vouchers and lotteries for the tiny number of newly built subsidized units.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Getting such housing is laborious and invasive, and it leaves out workers like undocumented immigrants and families whose incomes put them just beyond the threshold to qualify.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Naturally occurring affordable housing is in a sense more valuable, because it represents units that anyone — someone switching jobs or fleeing an abusive spouse, for instance — can find on Craigslist.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">This housing can also be easily lost, not because it disappears, but because it is purchased by a homeowner or investor who renovates in hopes of increasing rents.</span> This is what has happened over the last two decades: <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2014,</span> according to Harvard’s Joint Center, the nation has lost <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2.7 million</span> affordable units, defined as those carrying rents less <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600.</span>
Carline Chery,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> owns three Boston duplexes. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Two-bedroom units go <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1,800,</span> more than what the lowest-income renters can pay but <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $900 less</span> than the typical rent in the metropolitan area, according to Zillow.</span> Compared with a public company, Ms. Chery runs a shoestring operation, with no reserves and little capacity to absorb a missed month.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">So when tenants in one of her buildings recently stopped paying, she borrowed from family members to make the mortgage payment, then put the building up for sale.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The strongest interest has come not from another landlord, but a first-time home buyer.
</span>“I cannot afford it anymore,” Ms. Chery said.
Landlords and tenants both want more money.
Fearing a surge in homelessness, state and local governments spent March and April instituting triage measures, like bans on evictions and utility shutoffs, along with limited subsidies for struggling renters. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The CARES Act also offered aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Since then, tenant activists have unified around a cry of #CancelRent, staging car rallies and roadside protests to demand that the government halt rent and mortgage payments — without the accrual of back payments — as long as the economy is battered by the coronavirus.</span> Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a bill that roughly mirrors that desire.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Although the bill has little chance of passing, housing advocates and landlords’ groups have pressed for more direct help to renters.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The CARES Act <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allotted $12 billion</span> in housing grants to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states, but the money was largely directed to renters and landlords in public or subsidized housing.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That leaves out most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, and small landlords like Ms. Chery, whose loans are held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The House of Representatives recently passed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 trillion</span> HEROES Act, which in addition to more financial stimulus to households <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included $100 billion</span> in rental subsidies for tenants affected by coronavirus-related job loss.</span> That bill has no prospect of Senate approval, but landlord and tenant groups continue to push for expanded aid for tenants.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">“Small landlords and renters depend on each other, and both need emergency assistance to stay afloat during this time,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">“Without it, we will end this crisis having saddled low-income renters with more debt, and having lost more of our country’s critical housing stock.”</span>",,,,,,,0,,,1,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflation continued to slow on an annual basis in December, welcome relief for American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Consumer Price Index <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government’s official inflation measure over time.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They worry that services inflation — which is unusually rapid — could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank’s target.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed aims <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February — adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span>
“I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,” Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. “In my view, hikes <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">That was up <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">“What we’ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,” Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“Service inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.”
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">“The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“We’re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,” James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.

Lower gas prices helped to pull inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index’s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes — even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Here’s what to know about the December inflation report:
Overall inflation cooled <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Energy prices overall were <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down<span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">Food prices <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=""39"" class=""red"">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly — or decline outright — as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers — like hotels and day-care centers — to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">December’s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Food prices rose <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">Food prices overall were <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">The price of oranges dipped<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.
</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">President Biden celebrated Thursday’s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is “coming down in America month after month” even as it remains high in major economies around the world.
</span><span id=""56"" class=""red"">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.
</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“It all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,” Mr. Biden said.
</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession — with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=""60"" class=""red"">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.
</span><span id=""61"" class=""red"">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.
<span id=""62"" class=""red"">“Out-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> “Congress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.”
<span id=""63"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax — which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.
</span><span id=""64"" class=""red"">S&<span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500
The</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.
</span><span id=""65"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.
<span id=""66"" class=""red"">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=""67"" class=""red"">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.
</span><span id=""68"" class=""red"">That’s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed’s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=""69"" class=""red"">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.
</span><span id=""70"" class=""red"">“The risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,” said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> “What we see today is that may be the case. <span id=""71"" class=""red"">The Fed will be worried about that.”
</span><span id=""72"" class=""red"">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed’s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.
</span><span id=""73"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""74"" class=""red"">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=""75"" class=""red"">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.
</span><span id=""76"" class=""red"">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors’ expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed’s next increase in interest rates, <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=""77"" class=""red"">The Fed’s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.25 to</span><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""78"" class=""red"">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.72 percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.
<span id=""79"" class=""red"">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated to slow inflation; the longer interest rates stay high, the more pressure they put on company costs, and the higher the risk that the economy slips into recession.
</span>“We think any rally here based on the C.P.I. report will be temporary,” said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. <span id=""80"" class=""red"">“We have months if not quarters ahead of us where we need to see much lower levels of inflation, and we think we will get there</span> but it’s going to take time.”

60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,45383,"<h3>Tech billionaires have turned Halloween into a circus</h3>PALO ALTO, Calif. — There are certain predictable outcomes when you live in a neighborhood with a bunch of billionaires. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The real estate prices have gone up, of course.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Prices in nice restaurants have doubled, too.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">But Palo Alto resident Bill Glazier did not expect to lose trick-or-treaters to the annual Halloween production staged outside the home of his neighbor, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The Jobs used to give out this organic chocolate that nobody really likes.</span> It’s not like they’re handing out iPhones,” Glazier says. “People go because they want to see the show.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The show on Thursday night, put on by Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs, who was married to Steve Jobs, was a series of professional-grade set pieces featuring a lighthouse, a metal shop and a lunch counter.</span> It involved actors and props and lighting and stagehands, some of whom handed out bags of gourmet candy at the end of the display. The zombie cheerleader, zombie gym teacher, zombie lunch person and zombie friends zombie-danced to pop hits like Beyoncé and “Whip It.”
The show required permits from the city of Palo Alto for noise exemption, special events and road closure to shut down traffic for six blocks. In recent years, the show attracted <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 3,000 people</span>, according to a spokesperson for the Palo Alto police.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The tradition started with the former Apple CEO, a Halloween aficionado, who famously dressed up as Jesus Christ for Apple’s first Halloween party <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1979,</span> “an act of semi-ironic self-awareness that he considered funny but that caused a lot of eye rolling,” Walter Isaacson wrote in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 biography</span> “Steve Jobs.”</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">In addition to the organic chocolate, the Jobs house also used to hand out boxes of carrot juice, a favorite beverage of Steve Jobs, the inveterate health nut and vegetarian, according to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2005 book</span> “iCon Steve Jobs.”
</span>But more recently, much like the tech industry itself, the Halloween festivities have rapidly scaled from an organic attempt at connection into something unrecognizable. In Palo Alto, the suburban home to some of the richest billionaires on the planet, lines form hours before the show starts and curve around two blocks.
At times, the setup felt like a suburban Burning Man, the annual “commerce-free” desert festival where Bay Area techies, who might otherwise not interact with people outside their social circle, build elaborate stages and structures and delight in the communal ritual of gifting other Burners with free things — reveling in the freedom and safety of bounded generosity. Like Burning Man, the Palo Alto displays are ephemeral, often going up Halloween morning and <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vanishing 24 hours</span> later.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">[The Quest of Laurene Powell Jobs]
In recent years, flashy new entrants have joined the race.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo and employee No.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 at</span> Google, waged her own competing Halloween bonanza in nearby Professorville on Thursday night.</span> Trick-or-treaters lined up for a stupefying selection of movie-size candy: bags of Haribo Goldbears and Sour Patch Kids, full bars of Nestle Crunch, and boxes of Hot Tamales, Jujyfruits, Goobers, Milk Duds and Nerds. Plush stuffed animals — swans, zebras, sloths, elephants, pink giraffes, narwhals with sequins — were constantly restocked by a handful of adults behind the scenes. Kids were allowed to grab one candy and one toy, according to the adult restocking bars of Toblerone. The density and decadence were dizzying, at any age.
“Palo Alto is so spirited at Halloween — I just love it!” Mayer said in a statement. “Trick-or-treating in Professorville is a fun activity that really brings the neighborhood together.”
One of Mayer’s neighbors, Kim Blanding, who works in product marketing at Facebook and who brought her three boys to trick-or-treat at Mayer’s house, was dressed in all black with red lipstick as disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, a costume she chose because Theranos was “the epitome of Silicon Valley and VC demise,” Blanding said. “It’s such a chauvinistic world and yet this woman was able to capture it, but she was a fraud.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">A mile away in Old Palo Alto, in the empty lot across the street from the Jobs house, Yasmin Lukatz, the stepdaughter of billionaire casino magnate and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, threw a carnival-themed show.</span> Circus performers took turns on a makeshift stage near a blowup funhouse maze, while a witch perched on a tall bendy pole and bobbed in the air.
“It feels like because of where it is, you have to be part of the party,” said Lukatz, who bought the property that was listed <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $11.4 million</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
An invite-only section of Lukatz’s carnival had banners for ICON, or the Israel Collaboration Network, a group founded by Lukatz to connect tech communities in Silicon Valley and Israel.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">In past years, the show outside Google co-founder Larry Page’s house,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 500 feet</span> away from Powell Jobs’s Tudor mansion, has been epic, as repeat visitors will attest.</span> There was the UFO theme and the carnival theme. Dennis, a Palo Alto resident who works in fire protection and who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used, said the best year was the Gotham show a few years ago. “It looked like some Disney Hollywood people came up and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1 million</span>,” he said.
But this year, there was only a table with Christmas lights and plastic cauldrons filled with normal fun-size candy. Andy, who also spoke on the condition that only his first name be used and who works in logistics for one of the families on Page’s private cul-de-sac, said the families were “calming things down” this year and have been very busy, so decided to keep it low-key.
Some regular visitors were disappointed, peering past the rotating cast of women in costume handing out candy to make sure they didn’t miss anything. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But across the street, the party went on, with a nine-person band blasting Motown classics and the fog machine next door at the Jobs house beckoning.
</span>Meghan Horrigan-Taylor, chief communications officer for the city of Palo Alto, said the “neighbors reimburse the city for city-related costs.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But Old Palo Alto resident Lynn Brown, who lives down the block from Jobs, told The Washington Post she doesn’t have to chip in because the “nice neighbors” foot the bill, which she believes means it’s taken care of by Powell Jobs and Page.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Powell Jobs declined to answer questions through a spokesperson for Emerson Collective.</span> Page did not respond to questions.
Longtime residents may miss the old days, but the event has expanded far beyond them, judging by the crowds Thursday night. Particularly in the early hours, they were mostly multigenerational East Asian families who came from Mountain View, San Jose, Fremont, Milpitas or just a few blocks away in other Palo Alto neighborhoods to see the show and to let their kids trick-or-treat safely on closed-off streets. They spoke Mandarin and Hindi and Japanese and Turkish, code-switching to English to answer questions from The Post.
According <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2017 estimates</span> from the American Community Survey, Palo Alto <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 75.8 percent</span> white,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.3 percent</span> Asian, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.2 percent</span> black, a similar demographic breakdown to most tech companies.
Practical information about the Old Palo Alto Halloween event spreads by word of mouth, social media and private messaging apps. Kiki Wei, a Taiwanese event planner from Newark, Calif., organized a group by sending messages on the Korean messaging app Line and WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg owns four homes a five-minute drive away. Wei first heard about the event years ago from a friend’s Facebook, which did not specify the exact location. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“You need to Google ‘Steven Jobs address,’ ” she said.

The minutes suggested a rate increase is a possibility as early as September
WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials, playing a waiting game on the economy, sought to keep their options open at a July policy meeting as they tried to reconcile differences over whether it was time to raise short-term interest rates again.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed’s Wednesday release of minutes from its July 26-27 meeting suggested a rate increase is a possibility as early as September, but that the Fed won’t commit to moving until a stronger consensus can be reached about the outlook for growth, hiring and inflation.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Several officials, still not yet confident that inflation will rise to the Fed’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% objective</span> after running below target for four years, weren’t prepared to consider a rate increase.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Others, believing the U.S. is close to a fully recovered job market, thought a rate increase would soon be warranted, according to the minutes.
</span>“Members judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information,” the minutes said.

Stocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar could all be jolted when the Fed does actually push rates up again, since borrowing costs affect so much in the economy—including how much it takes to buy a home or car or finance a big corporate project.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed next meets Sept. 20-21.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since its last meeting, economic data have been mixed.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Jobs data for July were strong—payrolls <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 255,000</span>—but retail sales and inflation indicators for the month were soft, leaving open the possibility of a prolonged Fed divide that could further delay the next rate move.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Despite the mixed economic backdrop, some notable officials this week have sought to remind investors that the time for another rate increase was drawing near.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“I think we’re getting closer to the day where we’re going to have to snug up interest rates a little bit.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And that’s good news,” New York Fed President William Dudley, a close adviser to Chairwoman Janet Yellen, said on the Fox Business Network on Tuesday.</span> Dennis Lockhart, a middle-of-the-road official whose views often reflect the committee consensus, said Tuesday he wouldn’t rule out a September move.
“Most of the fundamentals underpinning growth of consumption are pretty solid,” Mr. Lockhart said. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">“Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound,” he added.</span> “I don’t believe momentum has stalled.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Some of the Fed’s worries have receded in recent weeks, including whether markets would convulse after Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Participants generally agreed that the prompt recovery of financial markets following the Brexit vote and the pickup in job gains in June had alleviated two key uncertainties about the outlook,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year, but several still harbor doubt, especially because inflation has run below the Fed’s target for so long.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in July and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.9% from</span> a year earlier.</span> The previous three months it was <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.1% from</span> a year earlier.
The central bank divided into three camps at its July meeting, the minutes show: those who aren’t ready to move rates up, those who are ready, and those who say the moment is getting closer.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Several officials “preferred to defer another rate increase in the federal-funds rate until they were more confident that inflation was moving closer <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2 percent</span> on a sustained basis,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Others believed the U.S. was “at or close” to full employment, meaning a state where unemployment was low, fully recovered from recession and at a point where if it falls much more it could cause more inflation.</span> These people believed a rate increase “was or would soon be warranted.”
“By far the most significant part of the minutes was the point, repeated at least twice, that (official) forecasts had changed little during the intermeeting period,” Roberto Perli, an analyst with Cornerstone Macro Advisers, said in a note to clients.
Back in June they all expected to raise rates this year. If none of them changed their forecast in a material way, it must mean they still see a rate hike this year as appropriate, he said. “A move by December was and remains a good base case,” he said.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials also worried that a prolonged period of very low rates could cause investors to misallocate investments or misprice risk, possibly leading to a destabilizing financial bubble and bust.

60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,22778,"<h3>Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming</h3>HOUSTON — A surge of oil production is coming, whether the world needs it or not.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The flood of crude will arrive even as concerns about climate change are growing and worldwide oil demand is slowing.</span> And it is not coming from the usual producers, but from Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana — countries that are either not known for oil or whose production has been lackluster in recent years.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">This looming new supply may be a key reason Saudi Arabia’s giant oil producer, Aramco, pushed ahead on Sunday with plans for what could be the world’s largest initial stock offering ever.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Together, the four countries stand to add nearly a million barrels a day to the market <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 and</span> nearly a million more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> on top of the current world crude output <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 80 million</span> barrels a day.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">That boost in production, along with global efforts to lower emissions, will almost certainly push oil prices down.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Lower prices could prove damaging for Aramco and many other oil companies, reducing profits and limiting new exploration and drilling, while also reshaping the politics of the nations that rely on oil income.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new rise in production is likely to bring economic relief to consumers at the gas pump and to importing nations like China, India and Japan.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But cheaper oil may complicate efforts to combat global warming and wean consumers and industries off their dependence on fossil fuels, because lower gasoline prices could, for example, slow the adoption of electric vehicles.
</span>Canada, Norway, Brazil and Guyana are all relatively stable at a time of turbulence for traditional producers like Venezuela and Libya and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their oil riches should undercut efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to support prices with cuts in production and give American and other Western policymakers an added cushion in case there are renewed attacks on oil tankers or processing facilities in the Persian Gulf.

Daniel Yergin, the energy historian who wrote “The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Power and Money,” compared the impact of the new production to the advent of the shale oil boom in Texas and North Dakota a decade ago.
“Since all four of these countries are largely insulated from traditional geopolitical turmoil, they will add to global energy security,” Mr. Yergin said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But he also predicted that as with shale, the incremental supply gain, combined with a sluggish world economy, could drive prices lower.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">There is already a glut on the world market, even with exports from Venezuela and Iran sharply curtailed by American sanctions.</span> Should their production come back, that glut would only expand.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Years of moderate gasoline prices have already increased the popularity of bigger cars and sports utility vehicles in the United States, and the probability of more oil on the market is bound to weigh on prices at the pump over the next few years.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The oil-supply outlook is a sharp departure from the early 2000s, when prices soared as producers strained to keep up with ballooning demand in China and some analysts warned that the world was running out of oil.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Then came the rise of hydraulic fracturing and drilling through tight shale fields, which converted the United States from a needy importer into a powerful exporter.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The increase in American production, along with a choppy global economy, shaved oil prices from well <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $100 a</span> barrel before the 2007-9 recession to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $56 on</span> Friday for the American benchmark crude.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Those low prices have forced OPEC and Russia to lower production in recent years, and this year many financially struggling American oil companies have slashed their exploration and production investments to pay down their debts and protect their dividends.

The new oil will accelerate those trends, energy experts say, even if only for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.
</span>“This could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,” said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics.</span> Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.
Production of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.
“Legacy decisions keep going,” said John Browne, BP’s former chief executive. “Things happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.”
The added production in Norway comes despite the country’s embrace of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Paris</span> climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.
Equinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, “The Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.”
Norway’s rebound <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 19 years</span> of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produce 440,000 barrels</span> a day, increasing the country’s output <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1.3 million</span> barrels a day <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.6 million</span> next year <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.8 million</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021.</span></span>
In Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 300,000 barrels</span> a day, and the country is expected to add as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 460,000 more</span> barrels a day by the end <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span> In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 15 billion</span> barrels of reserves.
In Canada, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,000</span>-mile <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Line 3 pipeline</span> that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span>.
And the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 120,000 barrels</span> a day early next year, rising to at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 750,000 barrels</span> <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025,</span> and more is expected after that.
Guyana potentially has the most complicated future of the four countries. Its ethnically divided politics are sometimes turbulent, and Venezuela claims a large portion of its territory. But with the oil fields miles offshore, drilling is largely protected. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">In addition, Venezuela is mired in a political and economic crisis and unlikely to challenge a Chinese state company which has an oil investment in Guyana, along with Exxon Mobil and Hess.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Energy experts say the new production from the four nations will more than satisfy all the growth in global demand expected over the next two years, which is well below the growth rates of recent years before economic expansion in China, Europe and Latin America slowed.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">At the same time, new pipelines in Texas are expected to increase United States exports <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3.3 million</span> barrels a day next year, from the <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 2.8 million</span>.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">That adds up to a vast surplus unless there is a resurgence of global economic growth to stimulate demand, or a prolonged conflict in the Middle East or other disruption to supply.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“To support prices, OPEC is going to have to extend and probably deepen their production cuts for a while,” said David L. Goldwyn, a top State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Getting the prices up to the point where Aramco can launch its I.P.O. is a big Saudi priority.”
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">The new barrels on the world market will also put pressure on companies producing in the United States, where profit margins for shale production are slim at current price levels and stock prices are falling.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“If I was in the business I would be scared to death,” said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.</span> “The industry is going to face capital starvation.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">American oil executives express concern that drilling will fade in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado as oil prices drop to as low <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $50 a</span> barrel in the next few years.</span> Small companies are expected to merge, while others go bankrupt.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">‘This Is the Most Lonesome Job’: Ride With a ‘Hot Shot’ Oilfield Trucker in Texas
As the United States has become the world’s largest producer of oil, demand in the fields has soared for pipes or drums in a hurry.</span> That’s where Mike Wilkinson fits in.
Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of the Texas-based producer Pioneer Natural Resources, said he expected the growth of United States oil production to ease <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1.2 million</span> barrels a day this year <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 500,000 barrels</span> next year and <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perhaps 400,000 barrels</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021.</span></span> Those increases are modest compared with the average increase of a million barrels a day every year <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2010 to</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018.</span>
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">But Mr. Sheffield said he was optimistic, in part because new supplies coming to market could be offset by production declines in older fields in Mexico and elsewhere <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2021.</span>
</span>“There are no more big, giant new projects except Guyana,” he said. “We just have to be patient for a couple of more years.”",,,,,,,0,,,,2,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plunge in Lira, Turkey’s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion
Turkey’s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.
Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes.</span> A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Turkey’s central bank insisted over the weekend that it would “take all necessary measures” to preserve the country’s financial stability.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But it has so far refused to raise interest rates, and the changes it has pushed through thus far have been limited in scope.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After the Turkish lira fell even further — one dollar <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">bought 3.8 liras</span> at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 7.2 liras</span> — investors dumped other emerging-market currencies.</span> The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 2 percent</span> after falling <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 6 percent</span> last week.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 percent</span></span> during the day.</span> European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In early trading on Wall Street, the S.&P.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 500 stock</span>-index <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 0.7 percent</span>, but quickly recovered and turned positive.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Turkey’s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,” Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.
</span>Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country — in this case, Turkey — can quickly spread to other regions.
</span>Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country’s prospects. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank’s independence.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Normally, a country in Turkey’s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency’s slide.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But Mr. Erdogan’s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“In the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as ‘risk off’ toward emerging markets,” said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.
</span>But “Turkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren’t,” he added. “I don’t think it’s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">On Monday, Turkey’s central bank relaxed some of its rules on the money that commercial banks must keep on reserve, freeing up cash to deal with the currency crisis.</span> The central bank also said that it would provide “all the liquidity the banks need.”
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 17.75 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.
</span>In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Do not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,” he said.</span> “You would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists’ and merchants’ responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C.”
Yet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey’s interior ministry had opened investigations <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 346 social</span> media accounts officials said had helped “manipulate perceptions” about the lira.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Compounding the fear in financial markets, there is a lack of information about which foreign banks may own Turkish government bonds or have lent money to Turkish companies.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 90 percent</span> of Turkey’s public and private sector debt with foreign lenders is in foreign currencies, according to the International Monetary Fund.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.
</span>A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">President Trump pledged on Friday to double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The comment, which was made in a Twitter post, spooked markets concerned that Mr. Trump could take a similar approach with other trading partners.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">“The catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade,” said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING.</span> “This is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it’s a pretty toxic environment.”
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">China’s currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump’s trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.34 percent</span> against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 15 months</span>.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">China’s main stock index lost <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 percent</span></span> at one point on Monday, but it closed <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 0.3 percent</span>.</span> The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percent</span>. Stocks in Seoul <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.5 percent</span>. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">A broad index of Europe’s biggest companies was <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 0.4 percent</span> in afternoon trading.
</span>A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Turkey’s economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“I’m a little concerned, but I wouldn’t be pressing the panic button,” the economist, Xu Sitao, said.

A Flying Elephant, a Teacher’s Hugs:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience
The virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.
As much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience — of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.
BRAZIL
“I am yearning for your hug. . .”
. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.
They had <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.
Students with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.
But the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.
Ms. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.
Her first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves — but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.
Then she came up with the idea of a pandemic “hugging kit” — disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.
The response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?
She rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.
“Distance can’t destroy what we have built,” Ms. Silva,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. “I needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I’m not able to hold them every morning.”
The kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon’s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.
Yasmim Vitória de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.
“She’s playful and she lets us have fun,” the 9-year-old said.
Ms. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.
“In a moment of tragedy, we’ve been able to share moments of love,” Ms. Silva said. “That is very powerful — Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni
INDIA
When India’s lockdown hit . . .
. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.
For years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India’s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.
When all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.
So Mr. Sahu,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn’t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.
“My mental condition was one of a mad person,” Mr. Sahu said. “When I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, ‘We have not eaten in days.’ It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.”
A spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.
When asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.
“Who else would take care of them?” he said. — Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj
ITALY
When an Italian bookstore appealed . . .
. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.
“We wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,” said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.
The idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers — and with luck a few volunteers — would read to people for <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. “We were thinking small,” she said.
But the response was overwhelming.
After the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.
Ms. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.
Ms. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she’d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.
In France, Paméla Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. “We managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,” Ms. Boittiaux said.
Ms. Romanese’s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.
“In a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,” she said. — Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden
BELARUS
When I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .
. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.
How he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country’s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk’s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.
</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. “All in all, I’m healthy and I’m free, which by today’s standards is quite something,” he said.
The doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.
Their authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.
But even as the president wouldn’t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing — a “people’s quarantine,” some called it.
One tech company, on Dr. Vitushka’s advice, bought <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.
After the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.
“All these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,” Dr. Vitushka told me. “And here we all came together in the face of a threat.”
For now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year’s pain — both for him and for his country — has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.
“We’re living through an intense coming-of-age period,” he said. “If I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.” — Anton Troianovski
CHINA
He has fostered more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .
. . . <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua’s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.
On Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.
Earlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week’s worth of food and water for their cats at home.
Please, they begged, could he help?
It was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city’s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.
But Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or “Old Cat,” did not hesitate.
“I just knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything,” he recalled. “It’s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.”
Almost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.
He wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.
<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats — and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.
“It was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,” Mr. Shuai said. “Looking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.”

Iran
The teacher had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .
. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.
For good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">children<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.
Some of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.
But Mr. Asadi,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> has <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.
“They told me, ‘You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher’s salary,’” Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. “But for me seeing the sweet smile on the children’s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.”
Overnight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.
He has also inspired others to act.
State-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.
</span>“Creating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,” Mr. Asadi said. — Farnaz Fassihi
BOLIVIA
The women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .
. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.
For months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women’s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn’t have to. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.
</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.
Sometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.
The death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.
“I wasn’t afraid to die,” she said. “Dying for me is a blessing, because I’m on the Lord’s path.” — Julie Turkewitz
CAMBODIA
When an elephant has to travel by plane. . .
. . . a lot of preparation is required.
It is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don’t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.
Now try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.
But on Nov.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.
Sent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.
Elephants are social creatures, and Kavaan’s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.
The trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.
Days before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.
Luckily, Kavaan’s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.
“2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,” said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, “and releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.” — Hannah Beech
KENYA
The calls and messages just kept coming . . .
. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi’s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food — or much of anything, really.
For many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.
Since it began, the project has raised more <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.
Ms. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.
“It changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,” Ms. Jaffar,<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. “There was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.”
But some parts of the story have been slower to change.
In April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.
“They didn’t stop until I said we were actually giving out food — ‘I am a community worker,’” she recalled.
Ms. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.
“We learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,” she said. — Abdi Latif Dahir
CHINA
She moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .
. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.
In late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.
Thousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hands 20 to</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.
Then, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor’s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor’s door.
That gave Ms. Guo an idea.
With friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.
She named her fledgling campaign “little vaccines against domestic violence,” and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.
Within hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag “little vaccines against domestic violence” has been viewed more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.
People across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.
The outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.
“Many people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,” Ms. Guo said, “but also because we’re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.”
Wuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.
</span>“It’s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,” she said. “So the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?” — Vivian Wang
<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">MEXICO
2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .
. . . for Lucía Riojas Martínez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.
An outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.
But then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. “Remember what you have to do tomorrow,” she told herself.
At the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.
But lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country’s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.
And so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.
Ms. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn’t enough, that there was a “mental and emotional health crisis in the community,” she said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.
“More than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,” Ms. Riojas said.
Run largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
“Every day we know that the road gets harder, but we can’t take a step backward,” she said. “It’s forward — and it’s together.” — Oscar Lopez
BRITAIN
At <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .
. . . but now comes the reward.
In recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.
Then, the coronavirus came to Britain.
With older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard’s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.
For a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.
“It is frustrating because I live alone,” he said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“And you get fed up with your own company.”
</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.
Then, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.
“I was most surprised,” he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">day 1 of</span> Britain’s mass inoculation program. “I’ve never given it any thought really. All I thought was that I would like to not get Covid.”
Mr. Pollard’s daughter Lynda Hayden drove him to a hospital for the shot. “Honestly, he’s my hero, nobody believes he’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 90,</span>” she said. “He’s just genuinely so kindhearted.”
Now, for Mr. Pollard, there is finally some hope of a return to normalcy — to his bus trips to the beach and celebrations surrounded by family
“The worst thing was wondering when it was ever going to end,” Mr. Pollard said.
Now, at least for him, it has. — Megan Specia

60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,14981,"<h3>The Crypto Party Is Over</h3>On Super Bowl Sunday, a Crypto.com ad featuring billionaire NBA star LeBron James lit up millions of Americans’ TVs. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“If you want to make history, you gotta call your own shots,” Mr. James said in the 30-second spot for the popular cryptocurrency-trading platform.</span> The words that splashed across the screen as the commercial ended read “Fortune favors the brave.”
Last week, Crypto.com laid <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">off 5% of</span> its workforce as its chief executive officer said on Twitter that the company was making “difficult and necessary decisions.”
The cryptocurrency industry was built in part on swagger, enthusiasm and optimism. Bitcoin backers’ rallying cry to rebuff skeptics was, “Have fun staying poor.” Those who didn’t buy in were letting the future pass them by.
At times, crypto has looked like a combination of Beanie Babies, dot-com stocks and the Velvet Underground: It is manic, it is money, and all the cool people are into it. It has also shared characteristics with other bubbles throughout history, marked by speculation bordering on delusion, disregard and disrespect for risk, and greed.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now, with markets sliding and inflation plaguing the global economy, cryptocurrencies have been among the first assets sold.</span> Since bitcoin hit an all-time high in November, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $2 trillion</span> of cryptocurrency value—more than two-thirds of all the crypto that existed—has been erased. Bitcoin itself has plunged <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $21,206,</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 69% off</span> its all-time high <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $67,802.30.</span> Crypto exchanges are bleeding users, crypto companies are laying off workers with at least one contemplating restructuring.
The crypto world is no stranger to booms and busts, which many in the industry refer to as “winters.” But many investors and workers are feeling this crypto crash more acutely than previous ones. When the dust settles, some crypto products and companies may no longer exist.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The reality is that like stock, with crypto, everyone is a genius in a bull market,” said Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire during the dot-com boom in the ’90s and has more recently invested in a number of crypto projects.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Now that prices are falling for both, those companies that were unnaturally sustained by easy money will go away.”
</span>The fever pitch
Bitcoin was launched as a form of electronic money <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 by</span> an anonymous creator who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Its price rose—unsteadily, haphazardly, often violently and with big crashes sprinkled throughout—as more people jumped in.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Numerous factors drove the rise, but crypto investors often shared a belief that the existing financial system had failed and crypto was the future.
</span>In <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2021,</span> the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., went public with <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an $85 billion</span> valuation, becoming the first major bitcoin-focused public company. It was viewed as a watershed moment for the crypto world.
In August, the city of Miami debuted MiamiCoin, a city-branded cryptocurrency.
The cryptocurrency complex pushed individual investors hard to join in. Crypto.com’s spot featuring Mr. James was one of several crypto ads that ran during this year’s Super Bowl. Ads for crypto companies are now splashed across Major League Baseball umpires’ uniforms and several major-league and college-sports venues. Coinbase ran an ad during the NBA Finals.
In <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2020,</span> well-known hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones revealed that he had a small portion of his assets in bitcoin, and called it a “great speculation.” <span id=""6"" class=""red"">At the time, bitcoin was trading <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $9,000.</span></span> Other professional investors followed. Bill Miller. Alan Howard. Stanley Druckenmiller. Suddenly, crypto was OK for the mainstream, it appeared.
Last December, the red letters spelling out “Staples Center” were pulled down from the famed Los Angeles venue, replaced by new signs reading “Crypto.com Arena,” after <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $700 million</span> naming-rights deal, believed to be the biggest in history.
Earlier this year, more <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 25,000 people</span> showed up for a Miami crypto conference, a slew of events across the city and the endless parties. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez presided over the unveiling of an 11-foot long,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,000</span>-pound, black, techno-styled bull, to rival New York’s famous one on Wall Street. The centerpiece at the conference’s expo hall was a giant, smoking, papier-mâché volcano. A party at the Versace mansion featured live music and synchronized swimmers.
The panels and speakers raved about bitcoin and its future. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor, who leveraged his business-software company and put more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100,000 bitcoins</span>, worth more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $6 billion</span> at the peak, on its balance sheet, said: “I am more bullish than ever on bitcoin.”</span> ARK Investment CEO Cathie Wood said bitcoin would rise to more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 million</span>. PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel suggested bitcoiners should make an “enemies list” of people opposed to the cryptocurrency.
At that conference and others, “you could see this certain amount of euphoria and sense of invincibility,” said Dan Gunsberg, who started investing in bitcoin <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span> today is the chief executive at crypto-based Hxro Network. Mr. Gunsberg said he knew the ebullience was a sign of trouble: “Nothing that moves that fast, that parabolic, can stay high. Gravity pulls it back to earth.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The crash
As fear of inflation rages, traders and investors are dumping assets in their portfolio that they deem risky.</span> Shares of unprofitable companies have dropped swiftly, with many newly public technology companies losing more than half their value in the first half of the year. Also high on the sell list: crypto.
So far this year, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value and currently trades at its lowest level since <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2020.</span> Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, has fallen <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 68% so</span> far this year.
“There was absolutely a lot of hubris across a lot of asset classes. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That led to a lot of greed and unsustainable business models and a lot of leverage in crypto.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That’s collapsing now,” said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, a crypto-focused financial-services firm.</span> “A large number of crypto funds will not survive this.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Many don’t appreciate the degree to which the sector’s growth has been aided by a long-running bull market in stocks and the market-juicing policies of the world’s central banks, said Joel Kruger, a strategist at asset exchange LMAX Digital.</span> It was the very system crypto sought to replace.
“The irony of it all is the easy-money conditions since <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 crisis</span> have lent themselves to the greatest period of risk-taking we’ve ever seen,” Mr. Kruger said. “That benefited cryptocurrencies.”
The fallout
In retrospect, Mr. Jones’s “great speculation” remark may end up being the most prescient comment on bitcoin. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The braggadocio that marked so much of the crypto world is fading as those easy-money policies have been reversed and the bull market in stocks has disappeared.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The carnage has spread from the cryptocurrencies themselves to companies that provide services in the market.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">For exchanges, trading activity drives the majority of their business, and with the selloff, revenues have fallen.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Coinbase reported <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $429.7 million</span> first-quarter loss in May and said its users were fleeing the platform, even as its executives sold stock and pocketed profits.</span> In June, for the first time since its founding <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span></span></span> it laid off staff—nearly one-fifth of its workforce. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Its stock now trades <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $51,</span> compared with its high <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $429.54 on</span> its first day of trading on <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 14,</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span></span> Gemini, BlockFi, and big-spending Crypto.com have also let staffers go.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">In early May, persistent downward pressure in the crypto market broke something big: the stablecoin terraUSD, a cryptocurrency meant to hold a <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">steady $1 value</span>, collapsed due to what was essentially a run on the bank, taking along with it its sister coin, Luna.</span> Almost overnight,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $40 billion</span> worth of the two cryptocurrencies were gone. That collapse has had downstream effects. Earlier in June, a large crypto-lending service called Celsius Network LLC, which had <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $12 billion</span> in user assets, froze withdrawals. The money is currently still locked up and the company has hired a law firm to try to work through its obligations and debts. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Another lender, Babel Finance, on Friday suspended withdrawals and redemptions.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital Ltd. has been considering strategic options, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, including asset sales or a rescue by another firm, after it suffered major losses.
</span>Despite the losses, some investors remain optimistic. Marshall Johnson Jr., a 54-year-old education-television producer in Maryland, started buying bitcoin <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> when it was <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $38,000.</span> His plan at the time was to slowly put in enough money to own one full bitcoin. He still believes in bitcoin’s future, and hasn’t changed his plan despite the selloff and despite the fact that on paper he has lost money. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">In fact, given the drop in price, he figures he’ll reach his goal sooner.
</span>“I’m closer than I was a year ago,” he said, laughing.
C.J. Wilson first heard of bitcoin <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> At the time, he was a Major League Baseball pitcher who lived in California and had spent his downtime buying and selling silver bars and gold coins. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">He said he viewed the digital currency with skepticism because he wasn’t sure how currency could be created on a computer.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> after he retired from MLB, however, he read the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on bitcoin and was intrigued.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">A self-described insomniac, Mr. Wilson said he began trading bitcoin in the middle of the night, and soon started dabbling in other cryptocurrencies.</span> “Sometimes you just look at them and think that’s a cool name,” he said. He attended crypto conferences all over the world, from San Francisco to London to Las Vegas.
Mr. Wilson eventually refocused his attention on bitcoin. This past year, though, he said he started noticing signs of froth. When Crypto.com sponsored the Lakers’ arena, he started wondering, “Where are they getting all this money from?” He said he received invitations to yacht parties from people who had made it big in crypto. He noticed Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, bought a home in California <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $133 million</span>. At the bitcoin conference in Miami this spring, he attended a glitzy party hosted by Gemini at a mansion.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">“To me, it makes you realize that was probably the top of the market,” he said.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Mr. Wilson said he still believes in bitcoin, but this spring he started trading bitcoin more than simply holding it.
</span>The current flushing-out of the crypto world strikes some investors as similar to the late-1990s and internet companies. On the one hand, investors were correct during that bubble: The internet was the future. But that didn’t stop many of them from losing boatloads of money as hundreds of internet companies failed.
“Long-term, we’re huge believers in crypto,” said Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who invests in crypto. “But short-term, watch out.”
Before the pandemic, Kelly Miller,<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35,</span> was a professional musician in San Francisco. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">He watched his income go to zero as the world shut down, and started investing in stocks through Robinhood Markets Inc.</span> In <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2021 he</span> decided to try buying some crypto coins, and purchased some dogecoin. He watched his small purchase soar in value before swiftly falling back. Despite the roller coaster, Mr. Kelly, who now lives in Istanbul, said he was hooked. Over the past year and a half, he’s bought bitcoin, Ethereum and solana, among others, with the most of his money in solana, he said. The latest downturn, which has hurt his portfolio, drove home to him the need for changes in the crypto world.
“This space needs to be regulated, it needs to be safe for consumers,” he said. He said he believes there’s a lot of value in the underlying technology, and in NFTs in particular, but he said he’s worried selloffs like this current crypto winter will erode trust among investors.

Mr. Held has been proselytizing bitcoin for years, and has a sizable Twitter following, but he was surprised earlier this year when he started getting recognized, both on the street and in an elevator in a Texas hotel. It was a sign to him of just how widespread the phenomenon had gotten. “I get recognized on the street? Walking around Austin?” he said. “That was really surprising.”
His fervor is driven by the idea that bitcoin solves fundamental problems with the existing system. None of the crashes—not even the current one—has shaken that belief.

Updated</span> Nov.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 2</span>:00 pm ET

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced Monday that its leader William Dudley is planning to step down early and retire in the middle of next year.

In a press release, the bank said Mr. Dudley is planning to leave ahead of the end of his current term’s conclusion in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2019 </span>“to ensure that a successor is in place well before the end of his term.”

Mr. Dudley’s impending retirement had been a matter of speculation for central bank observers for a while, but many were caught off guard by the accelerated timetable. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley will be leaving the Fed at a time of considerable change for the institution.

</span>President Donald Trump has nominated central bank governorJerome Powell to replace current Chairwoman Janet Yellen early next year when her leadership term ends. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last month, Fed vice-chair Stanley Fischer resigned from the bank.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a statement, Ms. Yellen said of Mr. Dudley that “the American economy is stronger and the financial system safer because of his many thoughtful contributions.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley was a close ally of Ms. Yellen, and she acknowledged as much, saying she appreciated his “wise counsel and warm friendship throughout the years of the financial crisis and its aftermath.”

News of Mr. Dudley’s impending retirement first broke over the weekend.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Speculation now moves to who will take over a key leadership role, running the part of the central bank that deals directly with Wall Street and implements monetary policy.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“I am extremely proud of the work we have done in New York, and as a System, from our efforts to help the nation navigate the financial crisis to beginning the process of normalizing the balance sheet to our work on reforming the culture of the financial services industry,” Mr. Dudley said in a statement.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">At an appearance later Monday before the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Dudley joked about why he moved up his exit date.</span> “Gee, retiring to play golf in January? That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He added that he was “sad” to leave the Fed.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists have generally been praiseworthy of Mr. Dudley’s role on the monetary policy front, but the outgoing official has long faced criticism over his bank’s oversight over the financial industry, where it is a major regulator.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In his appearance Monday, Mr. Dudley addressed central bank leadership flux and the fact that Mr. Powell breaks with recent decades’ practice in not being a Fed chairman who is also an economist.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley described himself as a “big fan” of Mr. Powell and new Fed vice chairman for supervision Randall Quarles.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The Fed will do just fine” with what’s certain to be a “smooth transition,” Mr. Dudley said.</span> While a lot may be going on, he added “if you are going to have a transition, this is a heck of a lot better of a time to have a transition than <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007.</span>”

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley sought to downplay the importance of any one person in determining Fed policy.</span> He noted officials right now are very much on one page in terms of the outlook. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He added that the Fed’s staff is also very important to the functioning of the institution, and pointed to them as a bulwark of stability during the leadership change.

The government's bank stress tests deserve a B-minus.

To give a sustained boost to investor confidence, the tests needed demonstrable rigor. They achieved that up to a point. While worst-case loss rates look tough, certain loan portfolios -- in particular commercial real estate -- at some banks seem to have gotten off lightly. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the tests' numbers for underlying earnings -- which are needed to offset soaring credit losses -- could turn out to be optimistic in some cases.

</span>It is hard to quibble with most of the government's worst-case loss rates, which are calculated for this year and next. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">For example, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.8% loss</span> rate for first-lien mortgages seems suitably tough, even when taking into account the aggressive underwriting during the housing bubble.</span> The government'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 13.8% worst</span>-case loss-rate for second-lien mortgages seems fair. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But it is a stretch to think Wells Fargo <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">WFC 1.79</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle, with its large home-equity book focused on stressed housing markets, will have a lower-than-sector loss rate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 13.2%.</span>

</span>The government may have been too optimistic in positing <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.5% commercial</span>-real-estate loss rate. This sector is just starting to fall apart, and defaults may move sharply higher as borrowers struggle to refinance loans. BB&T's commercial-real-estate worst case is higher <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 12.6%,</span> but its portfolio may arguably show higher losses.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The government's earnings projections also need to be taken with a pinch of salt.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It is optimistic to assume banks can repeat their first-quarter revenue generation, for instance.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Given the Fed has unleashed a tidal wave of liquidity into the system, interest rates are going to be extremely volatile for several quarters, making bank revenue very hard to predict.

</span>Another reason to be skeptical is few banks have to substantially increase overall levels of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 1 capital</span>, which includes common and preferred shares, by raising new money. The government is effectively saying most large banks were solidly capitalized even when investors fled earlier this year.

Instead of immediately raising overall capital levels, some banks are just shifting the mix toward common equity -- the highest-quality capital. Lenders that need to raise fresh money include GMAC, General Motors' lending arm. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Also, Wells Fargo's offering of common stock, announced Thursday, suggests its overall capital will increase.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Finally, the government has effectively said it wants banks to have <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 1 common</span> stock equivalent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4% of</span> risk-weighted assets.</span> First, investors have to decide whether they have confidence in the risk weightings.

Second, Tier-1 measures of capital leave out certain unrealized losses on securities that could become real later -- something captured by tangible-common-equity ratios.

Then they must decide <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whether 4% </span>-- which still translates into 25-to-1 leverage -- is safe for the unpredictable environment we are in.

As Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers
A wide-ranging presidential order helped block a railroad merger and tackle supply-chain problems, and it is planting the seeds for bigger actions.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — As rising inflation threatens his presidency, President Biden is turning to the federal government’s antitrust authorities to try to tame red-hot price increases that his administration believes are partly driven by a lack of corporate competition.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has prodded the Agriculture Department to investigate large meatpackers that control a significant share of poultry and pork markets, accusing them of raising prices, underpaying farmers — and tripling their profit margins during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As gas prices surged, he publicly encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate accusations that large oil companies had artificially inflated prices, behavior that the administration says continued even after global oil prices began to fall in recent weeks.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The push has extended to little-known agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission, which the president has urged to search for price gouging by large shipping companies at the heart of the supply chain.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The turn to antitrust levers stems from Mr. Biden’s belief that rising levels of corporate concentration in the U.S. economy have empowered a few large players in each industry to raise prices higher than a more competitive market would allow.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Corporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.
</span>White House officials concede that their antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately. The efforts, they say, will be more effective down the road. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the rise of inflation has given the White House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that Mr. Biden made an early focus of his tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In July, before the recent run-up in prices, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included 72 directives</span> for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair their own products.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">He has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department.</span> Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special White House adviser to Mr. Biden on competition issues.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">White House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden’s competition agenda.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But, they say, the push has given the president some of his most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and it will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">That role could grow even more prominent if Democrats lose control of the House or Senate in next year’s midterm elections and Mr. Biden is forced to rely on executive actions to advance his economic agenda.

-</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Psychology of Inflation: Americans are flush with cash and jobs, but they also think the economy is awful.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The administration’s focus on increasing competition “will spawn more innovation, more disruption, more start-up businesses in the U.S.,” said Brian Deese, who heads the White House’s National Economic Council.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And, he added, it “will deliver lower prices for Americans right away.”
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The president’s efforts to promote competition and potentially break up large players have rattled big companies and angered prominent industry groups in Washington, at a time when businesses are already grappling with supply chain problems, higher input costs and labor shortages.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has accused the Biden administration of interfering with the work of independent agencies even as it threatened litigation against the Federal Trade Commission, an independent consumer protection agency.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an interview that the measures would do little to blunt inflation.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of inflation and frankly a poorly dressed-up political argument,” Mr. Bradley said, adding that inflation had been very low in the last decade during a period of corporate consolidation.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">“Did they get soft concentration all of a sudden and in nine months it produced rampant inflation?</span> Of course not.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Much of the business community concern is aimed at the F.T.C., which, empowered by Mr. Biden’s executive order, has targeted companies without looping in the White House.
</span>An F.T.C. official said that the agency was pursuing its own agenda under Ms. Khan.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Late last month, the commission ordered nine large retailers, including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger, to turn over detailed information to help root out the sources of supply chain disruptions that were “harming competition in the U.S. economy.”
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The demand for documents was news to the White House, which had arranged for Mr. Biden to meet that same day with a group of retailers to discuss the administration’s efforts to relieve backlogs at the nation’s ports and to highlight the companies’ promises that their shelves would be well stocked for the holiday season.</span> Among the top executives attending the White House event were officials from Kroger and Walmart.
Overall, though, White House officials say they are pleased with the zeal federal agencies have shown for Mr. Biden’s antitrust efforts. Administration officials say the biggest successes so far include blocking the merger of a large American railroad, Kansas City Southern, with a Canadian counterpart and the merger of two large insurance companies, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which officials say could both have resulted in higher costs for consumers. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">They also cite a regulation allowing hearing aids to be sold without prescriptions and the auctioning of some gate slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to low-cost airlines.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">More dramatic results could emerge from a Justice Department fight against consolidation in the sugar industry and new efforts by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to require that future federal regulations be evaluated, in part, based on how they might affect competition in regulated industries.
</span>The Agriculture Department has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $500 million</span> to help seed new entrants in the meatpacking industries to challenge the small group of corporate giants that dominate it.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">Inflation F.A.Q.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">What is inflation?</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation costs and toys.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The Federal Maritime Commission has investigated the handful of corporate shipping alliances that effectively control the flow of goods across the world’s oceans and that have raised prices as much as ninefold during the pandemic, according to data from the freight-tracking firm Freightos.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">The commission’s analysis determined that market forces — particularly the rising demand for furniture and other items by consumers who have cut down on travel and dining out — are driving the increases, said Daniel B. Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> “I think it has upped our credibility” with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.
Perhaps the administration’s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">“We’re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,” the report said.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">“Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.”
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“The White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,” said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute’s president.
</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and “Big Meat” has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack’s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.
Mr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden’s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.
“These markets have been concentrated for a long time,” said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. “He didn’t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he’s going to fix it now?”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency’s new “Food Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program” that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.
</span>“The Biden administration understands this and knows this,” said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, “I would like to see more.”",,,,,,,0,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 3</span>:11 pm ET

HOUSTON—Lillian Godfrey has been sleeping on an air mattress on the floor of her friend’s shuttered night club, alongside her daughter and two pool tables, ever since floodwaters swept into her home here last month.

Ms. Godfrey,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 years</span> old, has a federal voucher for a hotel, but hasn’t had any luck finding a room nearby. Her daughter’s cars were lost in the flooding.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “The Lord closes some doors and opens others. He’s going to pull me through this sooner or later.”

As the floodwaters finally retreat across Texas, federal and local officials are now grappling with another vexing problem wrought by Hurricane Harvey: where to house one of the largest populations displaced by a natural disaster in recent years.

Tens of thousands of Texans are still unable to return to their flood-affected homes. Hotel occupancy in the Houston area has surged. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">And disaster recovery officials are scrambling to figure out short-term and permanent housing for those left homeless by the storm—a daunting and costly mission that could take months.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“While the final scope and scale of the housing challenge is still being realized, it is already apparent that this will be one of the largest, most complex efforts ever undertaken,” said Michael Byrne, who is heading up relief efforts in Texas for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

</span>As of Saturday night, more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 66,000 people</span> who fled the storm were staying in hotels paid for with FEMA vouchers, the agency said. <span id=""2"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 46,120 homeowners</span> and renters who were forced to relocate have also gotten approved by FEMA for financial assistance to help them with housing payments.

</span>More <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,700 people</span> remained in Red Cross shelters across Texas on Saturday night, according to the relief group.

Others, uneasy with the prospect of living elsewhere, have remained in their waterlogged homes. Still others were staying with friends, family or even strangers.

It is still unclear how many people in Texas will lose their homes because of the storm or how many eventually will be able to move back.

According to data culled by the state from cities and counties, an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 50,712 homes</span> suffered major damage in the storm,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,952 were</span> destroyed <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 76,364 saw</span> minor damage.

According to local officials, at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 130,000 single</span>-family homes in Harris County, which includes Houston, were estimated to have been affected by the rampant flooding here in some way. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2,000 and</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,000 large</span> apartment buildings likely sustained damage, and up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5,000 smaller</span> apartment buildings may have been damaged as well, according to officials.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“In terms of the sheer destruction due to the flooding, this is unprecedented in modern times for Houston,” said Tom McCasland, Houston’s director of housing and community development.

</span>Mr. McCasland said a sweeping effort is under way—involving city workers, volunteers and FEMA—to figure out which homes were still livable and repair them swiftly. The city is also working to locate any available apartment units that could house evacuees. Similar efforts were under way in flood-ravaged communities throughout Texas.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Cities in particular face significant challenges in the wake of disasters such as hurricanes Harvey and Irma because the housing costs in metropolitan areas are higher, there is little empty space for setting up temporary homes such as trailers, and hotel rooms can be scarce, experts said.

</span>For the first full week of September, hotel occupancy in Houston grew <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80.5%,</span> more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 44% higher</span> than the occupancy rate during the same week a year earlier, according to STR Inc., a data company that tracks the hotel industry.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">In Port Arthur, a coastal city of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 55,000,</span> Mayor Derrick Freeman called the housing situation “dire” in the wake of heavy flooding damage.

</span>This past week, one shelter at a middle school was full after the city’s main shelter had flooded weeks earlier, and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 250 people</span> had been evicted from their homes by landlords because of flood damage, according to Mr. Freeman.

Another several hundred were being housed at shelters around the state, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4,000 and</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5,000 people</span> were still living in flood-damaged homes, Mr. Freeman said.

He had initially hoped to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 600 people</span> temporarily housed on two barges that a private company was going to transport from nearby Louisiana.

But, by Friday, the plans had shifted, and large air-conditioned tents were brought in by FEMA and the state to house the evacuees who had been sheltering at the school, he said.

“There are folks here who are really in survival mode,” said Mr. Freeman, whose own home was swamped with water and has been living with his wife and four children at his mother’s home.

Debby Valsin, a 54-year-old retiree, had been living at the middle school shelter in Port Arthur with her nine-year-old grandson. She said her landlord terminated her lease after the floods because her apartment was uninhabitable, giving her five days to haul out her belongings.

Ms. Valsin qualifies for a FEMA hotel voucher but said all the nearby hotels she called are full. For now, with the start of school Monday, Ms. Valsin expected to be moved from the shelter into the tents.

“Your life is upside down,” she said. “I don’t have anything to start over.”

60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,37452,"<h3>Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters</h3>Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel is Meeting on Moderna Boosters
A recommendation is expected at Thursday’s meeting, which you can watch below, on whether to authorize a third dose for many recipients of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday, the panel will consider boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.
A key federal advisory committee is beginning two days of meetings that are expected to strongly influence decisions on whether at least some recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines will soon be eligible for booster shots.
After hearing from Moderna officials, Food and Drug Administration scientists, members of the public and others, the panel of outside experts advising the F.D.A. is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend emergency authorization of a third shot for recipients of Moderna’s vaccine. (You can watch the meeting here.)
The panel will vote Friday on Johnson & Johnson’s request for emergency authorization of a second dose. While regulators are not obligated to follow the panel's recommendations, they typically do.
The panel may be more skeptical of a booster shot for Moderna recipients than for Johnson & Johnson. Some vaccine experts have long argued that Johnson & Johnson should be a two-dose vaccine since its effectiveness is lower than those of the shots produced by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.
Pfizer-BioNTech won authorization for a booster shot for many recipients last month after arguing that its vaccine, while highly protective in the early months, lost some potency against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization over time.
But Moderna’s potency against hospitalization has held up better over time than Pfizer’s, according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In documents released Tuesday, Moderna did not argue that its vaccine requires a booster to prevent severe disease or hospitalization. Instead, it concentrated its arguments on preventing infection and mild to moderate disease.
Moderna said the mean antibody level of participants in its study <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.8 times</span> higher after the booster than it was after the second shot. In another measurement, the booster raised neutralizing antibodies at least fourfold <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 87.9 percent</span> of people compared to after the second dose, narrowly failing to meet the agency’s requirement <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 88.4 percent</span>.
Given that Moderna’s vaccine appears to still strongly protect against severe disease, at least some committee members are expected to balk at recommending a third dose. “Maybe it won’t be a slam dunk,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, of the panel’s vote. “Maybe we should wait a little bit longer on Moderna, let it drop off more first before we boost.”
One of the first presentations Thursday will come from Israeli health officials, who will discuss results of their booster campaign using Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine.
The Biden administration has been closely watching Israel’s experience because the country has a nationalized health care system that allows it to closely track recipients. The Israeli officials are expected to say that rates of infection and serious disease are significantly lower among those who got a booster shot than among those who did not. Israel’s definition of severe disease is significantly broader than the one used in the United States.
Since Israel’s data deal only with Pfizer’s vaccine, it is not clear how much weight committee members will give it. But it will provide them with more information than they had last month before voting to recommend a booster for a broad swath of Pfizer recipients.
Israeli scientists analyzed rates of infection and severe illness <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">among 4.6 million</span> people from <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 30,</span> when the country first began offering booster shots, to Oct.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span> They found that infection rates at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 days</span> after a third injection were five- to 11-fold lower among the boosted population than among those who did not receive an extra injection.
Rates of severe illness were<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.</span>5-fold lower for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">those 60 years</span> or older and threefold lower for those <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">aged 40 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60,</span> the researchers said. Death rates were nearly fivefold lower for those <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">aged 60 and</span> up.
The Israeli results have been published by a preprint service but have not been peer-reviewed.

An independent panel of experts advising the Food and Drug Administration is meeting regarding Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine booster shot on Thursday, and on Johnson & Johnson’s on Friday. Each day will culminate in a vote by the panel on whether to recommend emergency authorization for that booster for recipients of that vaccine.
So what happens after the panel votes? There are further steps at the F.D.A., then steps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the process ends with the states. Here’s how it breaks down:

The F.D.A., a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services that controls and supervises medications and other elements related to public health, takes up the advisory panel’s recommendation, which includes the question of who should be eligible. The advisory panel’s votes are not binding, but the F.D.A. typically follows them.
The F.D.A.’s top official — its acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock — issues the agency’s final determination on whether to authorize the boosters and for whom. Such decisions are typically issued within a few days of advisory committee meetings.
The C.D.C.
An advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States’ public health agency, reviews the F.D.A.’s decision. On Thursday and Friday of next week, that panel is scheduled to meet and vote on its recommendations regarding boosters.
The C.D.C. takes up that panel’s recommendations, and the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, issues the agency’s guidance on whether boosters should be used and who should be eligible. That guidance is deeply influential for states, doctors, pharmacies and other health care institutions and the general public. As with the process at the F.D.A., the panel’s recommendations are not binding, but the C.D.C. usually follows them.
However, there was a rare exception last month: When a C.D.C. advisory panel rejected the F.D.A.’s recommendation that frontline workers be included among those eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, Dr. Walensky overrode her own agency’s advisers and sided with the F.D.A.
The states
State health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C. In the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, the shots began being administered widely immediately after Dr. Walensky announced the C.D.C.’s guidance to allow them for people <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 65,</span> patients in nursing homes and other institutional settings, those with underlying medical conditions, and frontline workers.
Kyrie Irving, the N.B.A. star who has been indefinitely barred from practicing or playing with the Brooklyn Nets because of his refusal to get the Covid-19 vaccine, spoke out publicly on Wednesday night for the first time since the team decided to keep him off the court, saying his refusal was a matter of personal freedom.
“You think I really want to lose money?” Irving, who is set to earn <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $40 million</span> in salary this season, said on his Instagram feed in a meandering monologue that included incorrect medical information. More <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 90 percent</span> of players in the league are vaccinated, a proportion much higher than in the general population of the United States.
“You think I really want to give up on my dream to go after a championship?” Irving,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29,</span> said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“You think I really just want to give up my job?</span> You think I really want to sit at home?”
On Tuesday, the Nets said they had barred Irving from playing until he becomes “eligible to be a full participant.” New York City requires most teenagers and adults to have at least one vaccination shot to enter facilities such as sports arenas, and Irving has not practiced with the Nets in Brooklyn. Irving joined the Nets <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 as</span> they built a team of superstars that includes Kevin Durant and James Harden.
Irving asked that his decision to remain unvaccinated be respected and said that he has no plans to retire. He couched his refusal to get vaccinated in his opposition to mandates, saying nobody should be “forced” to do it.
Irving falsely claimed his decision to remain unvaccinated does not harm other people. The highly contagious Delta variant has quickly spread in areas with low vaccination rates. And hospitals in those areas have been overrun with unvaccinated patients, leaving few beds and staff members to treat other patients.
By the time vaccines for the coronavirus were introduced late last year, the pandemic had taken two of Lucenia Williams Dunn’s close friends. Still, Ms. Dunn, the former mayor of Tuskegee, contemplated for months whether to be inoculated.
It was a complicated consideration, framed by the government’s botched response to the pandemic, its disproportionate toll on Black communities and an infamous 40-year government experiment for which her hometown is often associated.
“I thought about the vaccine most every day,” said Ms. Dunn,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 78,</span> who finally walked into a pharmacy this summer and rolled up her sleeve for a shot, convinced after weighing with her family and doctor the possible consequences of remaining unvaccinated.
“What people need to understand is some of the hesitancy is rooted in a horrible history, and for some, it’s truly a process of asking the right questions to get to a place of getting the vaccine.”
In the first months after the vaccine rollout, Black Americans were far less likely than white Americans to be vaccinated. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining shots in their communities, their hesitancy was fueled by a powerful combination of general mistrust of the government and medical institutions, and misinformation over the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.
But a wave of pro-vaccine campaigns and a surge of virus hospitalizations and deaths this summer, mostly among the unvaccinated and caused by the highly contagious Delta variant, have narrowed the gap, experts say. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">So, too, have the Food and Drug Administration’s full approval of a vaccine and new employer mandates.</span> A steadfast resistance to vaccines in some white communities may also have contributed to the lessening disparity.
South Korea plans to ship <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 1.6 million</span> doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine to Vietnam and Thailand this week, the foreign ministry announced Tuesday, as the Southeast Asian nations struggle to contain the spread of the virus.
The donation comes as South Korea’s vaccination program has accelerated rapidly, <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 70 percent</span> of the population expected to be inoculated by the end of the month.
<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 62 percent</span> of South Korea’s total population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the nation is expected to ease the most severe restrictions by next month. Thailand has fully <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vaccinated 33 percent</span> of its population and Vietnam <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 17 percent</span>.
<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 1.1 million</span> doses will go Vietnam <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 470,000 to</span> Thailand, South Korea’s government said.
South Korea was among the last of the world’s wealthiest nations to start a vaccination program, leading to frustration among citizens who had already spent a year living under restrictions to control the spread of the virus. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eight months later, the country has inoculated more people per capita than the United States, which has secured the largest supply of vaccines in the world.
</span>The U.S. government invested <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1.2 billion</span> in the development of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, hoping that it would be one of many in an arsenal. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Instead, federal officials have yet to approve the use of the shot and million of doses are sitting unused, likely destined to be exported.</span> President Biden promised to donate up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 60 million</span> doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa.
AstraZeneca’s vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, but it has been dogged by production mishaps, questions about its efficacy and reports of very rare blood clots. Amid the concerns, South Korea temporarily suspended use of the vaccine in April, but cleared it for use again several days later.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Fall has traditionally been a fat time for businesses in New York’s North Country, as Canadian visitors flood into the region to celebrate holidays like Canadian Thanksgiving, taking in dazzling displays of foliage and feasting on big sales at local retailers.
</span>That influx has been stymied at the border for much of the last two years by strict controls implemented because of the coronavirus. On Wednesday, however, businesses all along the state’s northern border were celebrating the news that in November, fully vaccinated Canadians would again be allowed into the United States via the two nations’ heavily trafficked land crossings.
“A simple ‘Yahoo!’ seems to be the right answer,” said Kristy Kennedy, the vice president of marketing and tourism for the North Country Chamber of Commerce, in Plattsburgh, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 25 miles</span> south of Quebec. “We could not be happier.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">That sentiment spread across the state to Niagara Falls and other western New York towns and cities, where the border restrictions — and burdensome rules for American travel to Canada — had crippled usually robust business relationships as well as personal ones, separating some extended families for a year or longer.</span>",1,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the world of corporate borrowing, it rarely gets better than this.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Amid soaring investor demand for high-yielding debt, companies have been able to borrow at some of the lowest rates in history and with some of the fewest restrictions.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">In the leveraged-loan market, in which ""junk""-rated companies borrow from groups of banks and other lenders, companies are taking advantage of low yields to cut the interest rates they pay on debt.</span> This year alone, more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 below</span>-investment-grade companies, including Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Weather Channel, have successfully demanded to renegotiate the rates, and sometimes other terms, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $75.3 billion</span> of loans, the fastest pace <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2007,</span> according to S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">""It's literally been an unprecedented repricing wave in the loan market,"" said Trey Parker, portfolio manager <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">overseeing $13 billion</span> of leveraged-loan investments at Highland Capital Management.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Repricing allows borrowers to attempt to quickly take advantage of improving market conditions by reducing the payments lenders receive.</span> Investors can agree to amended terms or be replaced by others willing to accept less-favorable rates.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Repricings are cheaper and faster than the more traditional way for borrowers to lower interest rates on a loan: repaying the original investors and issuing new debt.

</span>Changing the pricing of a loan is well within a borrower's rights, thanks to a quirk of loan agreements. And, with so many lenders and investors willing to hand over their money, borrowers have seen little pushback.

Until now.

In recent days, a few companies have met resistance when trying to change the terms of their loans. Lenders' reluctance to cut rates may be a sign that the tide of repricings is reaching its peak, analysts and investors said.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">DuPont Performance Coatings, which was bought by Carlyle Group LP on Feb.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> this week failed in its efforts to reduce the interest on <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2.3 billion</span> loan.</span> Part of the reason investors balked: They had just agreed to the original loans less than a month ago, said investors who saw the deal. A DuPont spokesman declined to comment.

Vitamin maker NBTY Inc. aborted plans to reprice <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.5 billion</span> loan Monday. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Michael Collins, chief financial officer at NBTY, said the company ""didn't get a rate that was attractive enough to make it make sense.</span>""

Some investors have balked at the more aggressive repricings, telling investment bankers who propose them they won't participate. ""Our No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 issue</span> is trying to stem this repricing wave, and I think [investors have] slowed it down a bit,"" said Jeff Bakalar, who <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $10 billion</span> of leveraged-loan investments at ING Investment Management.

Still, many investors have had little choice, as there has been a deep pool of rivals clamoring to participate in leveraged-loan deals. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">These loans offer attractive returns, especially when compared with other types of debt, including Treasurys and corporate bonds, that are yielding near record lows.</span> Yields on junk bonds recently fell <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 6% for</span> the first time ever.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, leveraged-loan mutual funds and exchange-traded funds had inflows <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.2 billion</span> in the week ended Feb.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span> the biggest ever, according to fund tracker Lipper, whose records go back <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1992.</span>

Issuance from pools of leveraged loans that sell securities backed by the debt, called collateralized loan obligations, is expected to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach $80 billion</span> this year, according to estimates from Royal Bank of Scotland.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Neiman Marcus successfully renegotiated <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2.56 billion</span> loan on Feb.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">saving $19 million</span> a year, said Eric Artho, a vice president in finance for the retailer in Dallas.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""I think we got in at the sweet spot of the market,"" he said, referring to appetite cooling off this week.

</span>Sage Products LLC, a health-care products manufacturer, expects to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">save $3.8 million</span> a year from <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.75</span>-percentage-point rate cut on <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $380 million</span> loan. In recent weeks, companies have saved on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 1.13 percentage</span> points. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Sage was ""responding to increased investor demand [for loans] that has been prevalent in the debt capital markets over the past few months"" when it repriced its loan on Feb.<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span> said Chief Financial Officer Richard Naponelli.</span> Revlon Inc. and MGM Resorts International both are seeking <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5</span>-percentage-point rate cut. A Revlon representative didn't respond to a request for comment. An MGM spokesman said the casino operator was ""looking to lower pricing on a term loan.<span id=""12"" class=""red"">""

Companies that negotiated lower borrowing costs mostly could point to strong financial performance since they took out the original loan, said Jason Rosiak, head of portfolio management at Pacific Asset Management, an affiliate of</span> Pacific Life Insurance Co. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $3.2 billion</span> of fixed-income assets.

</span>Mr. Rosiak said it was an encouraging sign for investors that other firms with a less-sound case for repricing are being rebuffed. ""The dealers are finally finding out they are pushing too hard,"" Mr. Rosiak said. ""It's nice to see calmer minds prevailing.""

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET

U.S. stocks’</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.

Assets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $50.3 billion</span> in September. The ETF has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">advanced 5.1% over</span> the past month.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Value stocks, often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth, saw the largest divergence in performance from their growth-focused counterparts this decade, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study that looked at the first half of September.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors have pared positions in technology stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns in recent years.

</span>Funds tracking momentum stocks, those that investors are purchasing because they have been rising, recorded last week their first significant outflows since March of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And one of the biggest momentum-focused ETFs has edged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.4% over</span> the past month, underperforming the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> which has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 4.2%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves are the latest sign of how a jumble of contradictory data has investors grappling with two divergent paths for the U.S. economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A recovery from a soft patch in growth would, in theory, boost companies such as financials and energy companies, whose shares have underperformed broader markets over the years.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But an economy weakened by protracted trade conflicts and slowing growth abroad would likely push the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy, providing a tailwind for Treasurys and growth stocks.

</span>Many investors are opting for a nuanced approach. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Hugo Rogers, who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $5 billion</span> as chief investment strategist at Deltec International Group, said his fund this month trimmed positions in Treasurys and gold and picked up shares of oil drillers, including Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. Shares of the S&P 500’s energy sector have zipped past the broader index in the past month, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 8.5%.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We are trading what we think are the early stages of a reversal, and watching out for a bigger reversal that can last for many years,” he said.

</span>A confluence of factors is driving the most recent shift. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many are worried that the world’s biggest central banks are unlikely to loosen monetary policy much further.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Rates in Europe and Japan are already at or near historic lows, while the Fed has signaled that its latest rate cuts are unlikely to be followed by a long easing cycle.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That could spell bad news for the big, momentum-driven technology stocks, which have been a key engine for the market’s gains in recent years.</span> Some of the largest tech stocks have lost steam. Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2016.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 shed</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.8%.</span>

</span>Momentum stocks haven’t been as widely held as they are now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.

</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.

</span>Momentum trades “worked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,” Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span>

Still, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.

</span>“It’s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. “It’s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.”

Yet many say the shift is only getting started. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Diane Jaffee, a senior portfolio manager <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">running $3.7 billion</span> in value-focused funds at TCW Group Inc., notes the spread between the trailing price/earnings ratios of growth and value stocks on the <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 1000 index</span> hasn’t been this wide since the dot-com crash <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2001.</span>

</span>Her fund has received more inquiries from pension funds and endowments in the past several weeks than it has in years, Ms. Jaffee said. “A lot of people don’t understand that value cannot die,” she said.

60b964cbdd0817815f7c3d32,77623,"<h3>Four nursing home residents have died at an evacuation facility, Louisiana officials say.</h3>Extreme Weather and Climate UpdatesSept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> 8:13 p.m. ET
Four Louisiana nursing home residents who were evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ida have died at facility where state inspectors were prevented from conducting a full assessment this week, state officials said on Thursday.
Three of the fatalities have been classified as storm-related by the coroner, though definitive causes of death have not yet been confirmed, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
The deaths occurred at a facility in Tangipahoa Parish, north of New Orleans. Inspectors “promptly visited the site but were expelled from the property,” state officials said in a written statement. “We have significant concerns about conditions in this facility.”
More <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 800 residents</span> from seven different nursing homes had been moved to the Tangipahoa Parish facility, and state officials said they are working to find safe placements for them, beginning with the most vulnerable.
As of Thursday morning,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 721 had</span> been moved. A dozen of those required hospitalization.
“We will be taking action against these nursing facilities, and will be making appropriate referrals to law enforcement,” the State Department of Health said.
“It’s very disheartening,” said Robby Miller, the Tangipahoa Parish president.
Mr. Miller called the incident is a cautionary tale for others with family members in nursing homes in Louisiana: The conditions and quality of care at an evacuation facility may not be as good as in a typical nursing home.
Some of the nursing home residents have now been moved to a state facility run by Louisiana State University in Alexandria, Mr. Miller said.
The news came as officials in New Orleans announced on Thursday that they were organizing a voluntary evacuation option for residents hoping to get out of the city, which remains largely without electricity.
Details of that plan are still in the works, but it would allow residents to be taken to a state-run shelter outside the city, said Collin Arnold, the New Orleans director of homeland security.
The city would give priority to elderly and disabled residents and then make the option available to the general public, he said.
Across Louisiana, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 594,000 customers</span> remained without power on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the electric utility Entergy. By early afternoon,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,000 power</span> customers in New Orleans had their electricity restored, said Ramsey Green, the city’s deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Entergy hoped to restore full power to the French Quarter and central business district by late Thursday, he said.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Of 27 electric</span> substations in New Orleans, Mr. Green said,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 are</span> back online.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell, speaking at an afternoon briefing, noted that in addition to electricity, access to fuel continues to be a challenge for city residents. “We just have not received adequate fueling sources to the general public.” Ms. Cantrell promised that “when we get more we shall share more.”
The storm that ripped through southeastern Louisiana on Sunday left a still-untold number of people without homes and wreaked havoc on other essential services. Hundreds of thousands of people found themselves in places where water infrastructure was badly damaged by the storm and pumps and treatment plants were left without power.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, who is expected to visit the state on Friday, said the flash floods that inundated New York City and the powerful winds that knocked out power in Louisiana were a sign that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here” and that the storms and fires creating life-or-death situations across the country constituted “one of the great challenges of our time.”
“Hurricane Ida didn’t care if you were a Democrat or Republican, rural or urban,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, urging Congress to pass his economic agenda when it returned from its recess later this month, in order to provide critical investments in electrical infrastructure.</span> “This destruction is everywhere. And it’s a matter of life and death, and we’re all in this together.”
In the New Orleans area, carbon monoxide poisoning, from the misuse of generators, has sent at least a dozen people to hospitals and was linked to two deaths, the authorities said.
In Jefferson Parish, more populous than the city of New Orleans and right next door, virtually all residents were either experiencing water outages or under advisories to boil their water. Even as the heat was suffocating and air-conditioning almost nonexistent, drinking water in most of the parish was limited to whatever one had stocked before the storm or could get after waiting in lines for hours.
“This has become basic-level subsistence,” said Steve Robinson, the senior pastor of Church of the King, which has a site in Kenner, where a line of cars rolled through as volunteers from his congregation handed out pallets of water and buckets packed with toiletries, flashlights, first-aid kits and nonperishable foods. They eventually ran out of warm meals.
This was life, upended, in much of the region — an oil state in dire need of fuel, with places devastated by flooding left desperate for water. More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.
At a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was “a broken community” that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.
“I had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,” she said. “It looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.”
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — There were several flare-ups during a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.
It was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.
“I feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what’s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,” said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.
She added, “I’m just worried sick.”
On Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.
Conditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.
“This is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it’s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire’s edge now,” he said.
Other firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.
Firefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.
After the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.
“The weather has been working in our favor,” said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. “Look at the Dixie fire.”
Firefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake’s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.
The blaze, which <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and “squirrelly winds” in the Kirkwood area.
But so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.

The Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.
More <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews — sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain — build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.
“It becomes ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing — Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.
By Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.
Southeast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties — the town of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.
“The fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,” said David Hammond,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.
Mr. Hammond’s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, “in case we’ve got to go.”
In other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire’s wrath in challenging terrain.
More <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.
Several towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.
“We would hope that we’re on the downhill slide,” Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. “But after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,” he added, “it’s just hard to venture a guess.”
PHILADELPHIA — As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 87,</span> was in his <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.
By late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back. Still, it could be worse.
“I feel so bad for the people who lost property,” he said.
Those people were all over the region on Thursday, as residents of Mid-Atlantic States awoke to a trail of destruction left behind by remnants of Ida, which struck Louisiana as a hurricane days before. Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns — and were still rising.
Officials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.
Tens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.
“Al Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,” said Frank Feingold,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.
The Schuylkill had reached the “major” flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.
“We are still doing water rescues across the city; we’ve done that for the <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 15 hours</span> now continually,” Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. “We know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 100 years</span>,” he added. “And potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.”
The mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. “Extreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,” he said. “They are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.”
In Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L’angolo. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.
“It was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,” he said. “It came halfway up the windows.”
Some of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that “the size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,” with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.
“After last night’s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,” said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. “Both waterways have already surpassed all-time records.”
In Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.
The Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">got 10 inches</span> of rain. “I don’t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,” Mr. DiGirolamo said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.
One of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.
</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.
“For me it was just like a flash,” said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. “We tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.”
When he came outside, he found his neighbor’s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink. It wasn’t his.

In the aftermath of a ferocious storm caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida that killed more than three dozen people in four states, national and local leaders acknowledged Thursday that extreme weather events posed an urgent and ongoing threat.
The storm killed at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 people</span> in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut and left more <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150,000 homes</span> without power. States of emergency remained in effect across the region by midday Thursday, as officials sought to get a handle on the damage.
Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm
More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 people</span> were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred.
Speaking from the White House, President Biden said the damage indicated that “extreme storms and the climate crisis are here,” constituting what he called “one of the great challenges of our time.”
At a news conference in Queens on Thursday morning, Gov. Kathy C. Hochul of New York said she had received a call from Mr. Biden, who she said “offered any assistance” as the state assessed the damage from Ida, a storm that she said represented a new normal.
“We need to foresee these in advance, and be prepared,” she said.
The deluge of rain on Wednesday — more than half a foot fell in just a few hours — turned streets and subway platforms into rivers. Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 150 miles</span> per hour. Some rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were still rising.
Ida’s remnants brought historic hourly rainfall to New York and New Jersey.
Each bar represents one recorded hour of precipitation in Newark.
The rain broke records set <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 days</span> before by Tropical Storm Henri, underscoring warnings from climate scientists of a new normal on a warmed planet: Hotter air holds more water and allows storms to gather strength more quickly and grow ever larger.
Many of New York City’s subway lines remained suspended into the evening on Thursday. Airports were open but hundreds of flights had been canceled.
In New York City, the dead ranged in age from a 2-year-old boy to an 86-year-old woman, the police said. Some drowned in basement apartments in Queens, where a system of makeshift and mostly illegally converted living spaces has sprung up.
On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that at <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 23 people</span> in the state had died. They included four people found dead in an apartment complex in Elizabeth and two people were killed in Hillsborough, N.J. after they became trapped in their vehicles, a spokeswoman for the town said. Another death occurred in Passaic, N.J., where the Passaic River breached its banks and fish flopped in the streets.
Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced that the state would lower flags to half-staff to honor Brian Mohl, a state police sergeant whose car was swept away by the floodwaters.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 3.15 inches</span> of rain that fell in Central Park in one hour on Wednesday eclipsed the record-breaking one-hour rainfall <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.94 inches</span> on Aug.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span> The National Weather Service, struggling to depict the level of danger, declared a flash flood emergency in New York City for the first time.
In Bergen County, New Jersey’s most populous county, County Executive James Tedesco, a former firefighter, said on Thursday: “We have not complete devastation but close to it. This is as bad as I’ve ever seen it.”

Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue, feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by Hurricane Ida and its aftermath. Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.
Before you give, do your research.
Natural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.
</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.
Donations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.
If you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.
Here are some local organizations in the storm area.
All Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.
The Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.
Culture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin’ Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.
AirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.
SBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.
A number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana’s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.
Bayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.
Louisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.
National organizations are lending a hand.
AmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.
Mercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida’s wake and is accepting donations.
GoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.
Project HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.
The Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 90999.</span>
The Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.
United Way of Southeast Louisiana is collecting donations for a relief fund to rebuild and provide long-term assistance, including community grants.",,6,,,,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A woman visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. ""You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,"" she said.

Mr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.

</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience—in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah—is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.

</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.

Crude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha—groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.

</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad—but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.

Mr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.

""If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,"" he said.

Ayman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.

In normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.

Inside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.

Most of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are ""temporarily"" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.

</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.

Mr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, ""Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>""

Although the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.

For nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.

Mr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said—showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.

With Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.

The nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.

Mr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.

""We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,"" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.

Mr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.

Mr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.

""We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,"" he said.

Lately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.

Mr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. ""They are mere riffraff,"" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.

Last July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.

Mr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 24 hours</span> to ""apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms"" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.

</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.

Mr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called ""threats against his personal safety in Syria."" In <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.

Mr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.

Mr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same ""conspiracy"" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.

As for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. ""If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,"" he said.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,95609,"<h3>ECB Signals Rate Cut, Possible Stimulus Relaunch</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Central bank is examining a return to asset purchases, a major policy shift

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:30 pm ET

FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it is preparing to cut short-term interest rates for the first time <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016 and</span> restart a giant bond-buying program, in a significant policy shift that aims to insulate the wobbling eurozone economy from global headwinds ranging from trade tensions to Brexit.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The move underscores the ECB’s activism under its departing President Mario Draghi, whose aggressive stimulus policies recently caught the attention of President Trump.</span> Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Draghi in a series of tweets last month, complaining that the Italian official had weakened the euro at the expense of U.S. firms, but later suggested he might like to hire Mr. Draghi for the Federal Reserve.

The ECB’s decisions over the coming weeks will be felt long after Mr. Draghi steps down in October.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">While it stopped short of immediate action, the ECB’s clear signal of intent raises the pressure on other major central banks, including the Fed, to follow suit with interest-rate cuts.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Fed is widely expected to lower interest rates for the first time in over a decade when it meets next week.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">In a statement, the ECB said it was “determined to act” to prop up inflation rates that have persistently undershot the central bank’s target of just <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 2%,</span> which the economic slowdown puts further out of reach.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It said it was expecting to keep its key interest rate at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.4% or</span> lower through the first half <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economic outlook “is getting worse and worse,” especially in manufacturing, Mr. Draghi said at a press conference on Thursday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Basically we don’t like what we see on the inflation front.”

</span>The ECB said it had asked staff committees to examine policy options including the possible design of a new bond-buying program. It has previously used such language to signal that fresh action is imminent.

The ECB’s next policy meeting is on Sept.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12.</span> “It now increasingly looks as if the September meeting will not only bring a single measure but rather a package of several measures,” ING Bank analysts said.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Investors initially cheered the news, sending bond prices up and some yields to fresh lows, while also lifting European bank stocks and selling the euro.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But those moves all reversed as it became clear that Mr. Draghi would present no details of the stimulus package for now.

</span>Germany’s 10-year government bond yield hit a record low of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.461% but</span> later rose again as some investors sold bonds, settling at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.406% in</span> the afternoon. Similarly, the euro also fell to its lowest level in more than two years, but bounced back to be <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.24% on</span> the day <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.117.</span>

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Major central banks, from Asia to Europe, have signaled a return to ultralow interest rates in recent months amid mounting threats in the global economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Central bankers are eager to act early to safeguard the long economic expansion because they appear to have limited policy space to counteract any recession with interest rates already low.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The eurozone economy is still expanding and its inflation rate is <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 1%,</span> not far from the ECB’s target.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That is a marked change from the ECB’s last major round of stimulus in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016,</span> when the currency union was flirting with deflation, or a cycle of falling prices.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Still, economic indicators have started to flash red in recent months as the region’s export-focused firms emerged as victims of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

</span>The ECB’s early signal could help to reassure investors that the central bank still has the firepower to cope with fresh turbulence.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">A move in September would simplify the early part of the term of Mr. Draghi’s likely successor, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, by not confronting her with immediate decisions about how to handle the slowdown.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A former lawyer and French finance minister, Ms. Lagarde has no experience in central banking, although Mr. Draghi called her an outstanding choice on Thursday, pointing to her work at the IMF.

</span>But it also raises legal and practical questions about how much more the ECB can accomplish with its current toolbox. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The bank’s key interest rate is already below zero and its balance sheet has swollen to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 40% of</span> eurozone economic output, double that of the Federal Reserve.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,76641,"<h3>Mexico’s president says he wants to avoid a clash with Trump</h3>MEXICO CITY — President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday that he would defend the interests of Mexicans but wanted to avoid a clash with Washington, after the Trump administration announced it would slap punitive tariffs on its southern neighbor unless it did more to stop irregular migration.
“There is no need for confrontation,” the leftist president said at his daily morning news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mexico is heavily dependent on cross-border commerce and this year has become the United States’ No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 trading</span> partner, eclipsing Canada and China.</span> The Mexican peso slid <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 percent</span> on the news, to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 20 pesos</span> to the dollar.
López Obrador said he believes that Trump will not follow through on his announcement late Thursday of a plan to impose a series <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 percent</span> tariff increases on all goods from Mexico unless it stops the migration flow.
“I think that President Trump will understand that this isn’t the way in which these things can be resolved,” López Obrador said. “I think that there will be a correction, perhaps not immediately, but it will happen, because these measures aren’t good for either the Mexicans nor the Americans.”
[U.S. lawmakers express alarm as Trump forges ahead with Mexico tariffs]
He added that conflicts in the bilateral relationship needed to be “resolved with dialogue.” López Obrador dispatched his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, to Washington on Friday for urgent talks.
But Trump doubled down on his threat Friday morning. Mexico “can easily fix this problem,” he tweeted. “Time for them to finally do what must be done!”
López Obrador took office in December promising a change in Mexico’s treatment of Central American migrants, who have often been abused and extorted by corrupt Mexican police. His government subsequently issued thousands of “humanitarian visas” allowing migrants to work and travel in Mexico, and authorities tried to provide food and shelter for the large caravans of migrants seeking to cross the country to reach the border with the United States.
But Mexico has toughened its policies in recent months, as the numbers of migrants have soared and the Trump administration has berated López Obrador’s government for not doing more to stop them.
Mexico <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">deported 9,120 foreigners</span> in March, up <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5,585 in</span> January. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">It canceled the “humanitarian visa” program after experiencing overwhelming demand.</span> And it has agreed to a Trump administration request to host migrants seeking U.S. asylum while they go through the application procedures — a process that can take months.
“We haven’t just been sitting around with our arms crossed,” said López Obrador.
[Trump and Mexico’s new president got off to a good start]
The Mexican president has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump despite significant policy differences on immigration and other issues.
He said Friday that Mexico would enforce its immigration laws but would not take actions that violate human rights. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He noted that people were flowing out of Central America “not by choice, but necessity” because of violence and a lack of jobs.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">López Obrador has sought to enlist the United States and other countries in supporting a “Marshall Plan” for Central America, aimed at improving infrastructure and job opportunities in a way that would discourage migration.</span> But while Washington has offered loan guarantees, so far it has not committed substantial funding to the plan.
Some Mexicans called Friday for a sterner response to the United States.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The Mexican government must be firm and not flinch when faced with Trump’s threats,” said Enrique Campos Suárez, a columnist for El Economista newspaper.</span> “We are in the worst moment in decades in our bilateral relationship.”

Howard Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global brand with more <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 25,000 shops</span>, said last week that he was planning to step down as chief executive to work on a project within Starbucks to build high-end coffee shops charging as much <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as<span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $12 for</span></span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 ounces</span> of coffee.

Starbucks plans to <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">open 20 to</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 giant</span> Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room outlets—where rare, exotic coffee grown in small batches will be roasted on site and prepared using a variety of brewing methods—as well as up <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1,000 smaller</span> stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand.

“We’ve seen so-called ‘indies’ selling cups of coffee for a lot more than we’re charging and creating an interesting buzz,” Mr. Schultz said last week in an interview.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Some experts say the company’s plan to create a subbrand of luxury coffee shops aimed at the affluent is a good strategic move, given consumers’ growing interest in better-quality coffee.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They also point to a shrinking middle class with less discretionary spending power, which threatens demand for traditional Starbucks coffee.

</span>In addition to coffee, the new stores will offer craft cocktails, informed by a new generation of high-end “mixology” bars and trendy watering holes that strive for a speakeasy atmosphere. Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Starbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market—the U.S.—for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5%.</span>

</span>Mr. Schultz said the company’s plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries.</span> “They never protected themselves on the high end,” he said of beer companies. “I think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.”

It isn’t just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.

Millennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2008 and</span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span> the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 36% from</span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13%,</span> while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 41% from</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19%,</span> according to the National Coffee Association.

Consumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers’ names was an average <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $9.95 higher</span> per pound than those that didn’t, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Andrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 7% to</span><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8% annually</span>, compared <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 1% to</span><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2% for</span> all coffee.

</span>Starbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald’s Corp., Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.’s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee and espresso drinks on the cheap.

</span>“In coffee you have to pick a path,” said Credit Suisse analyst Jason West.

Still, the only proof of the new Starbucks concept is the Seattle Roastery, a store it opened two years ago. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Sales there are <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 24% from</span> a year ago and the average check is four times that of a traditional Starbucks.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Brooke de Boutray, managing director and portfolio manager at Seattle investment firm Zevenbergen Capital, said the questions being asked now—whether the Roastery model can be replicated and whether people will really shell <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">out $6 to</span><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $12 for</span> coffee—are the same ones people asked when Starbucks went public <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992 and</span> its coffees ranged in price <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 65 cents</span> for drip coffee <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $2.85 for</span> espresso beverages.</span> “We talked to our clients in pension funds and they said ‘Who in their right mind would <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $2 on</span> a cup of coffee?’ "" she said.

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 28,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 2</span>:40 pm ET

GlaxoSmithKline PLC <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">GSK 0.20</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle is pinning the future of its HIV business on an audacious bet: upending the decades-old treatment strategy that has turned a fatal illness into a chronic condition.

</span>The treatment of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has changed little since the mid-1990s, when the introduction of a new class of drug dramatically improved HIV therapy. Doctors found that combining the newer type of antiretroviral drug with two drugs from an earlier class hindered the virus from developing resistance.

A three-drug regimen has remained the standard approach since then, with drug development efforts focused on making ever more powerful triple combinations.

Glaxo executives want to change that. They hope the U.K.-based drug company’s latest HIV pill is powerful enough to suppress the virus with the help of just one other drug. That, according to Chief Executive Andrew Witty, would be a “game-changer,” because taking fewer drugs would produce fewer side effects.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now, Glaxo’s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare, in which Pfizer Inc. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">PFE 2.30</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle of the U.S. and <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Shionogi 4507 </span>-1.46%decrease; red down pointing triangle & Co. of Japan hold minority stakes, is getting down to the long process of proving it.

</span>The drug in question, dolutegravir, is one of a class of HIV drugs known as integrase inhibitors that rapidly reduce the level of virus in the blood. It is already approved for use as part of traditional triple therapy and so far, there are no reported cases of the virus developing resistance to dolutegravir in patients who are new to treatment. That makes it unique among integrase inhibitors, according to David Hardy, an HIV doctor and a spokesman for the HIV Medicines Association, an advocacy group.

While dolutegravir’s profile suggests it could potentially suppress HIV without the help of any other drug, Glaxo is taking a precautionary stepwise approach to investigating its promise, said a company spokeswoman.

The most important benefit of a two-drug regimen is that it would come with fewer side effects. Such effects, including nausea, diarrhea, kidney problems and bone-thinning, are one of the most common reasons for patients to change an HIV regimen. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It could also lighten the financial burden of HIV.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rochelle Walensky, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, estimated that switching just a quarter of patients currently on triple therapy to dolutegravir plus 3TC—an older, generic HIV drug—would knock more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3 billion</span> off the cost of treating HIV over a five-year period.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The cost saving is less clear if both drugs in the regimen are still under patent protection.

</span>Glaxo is putting “tremendous focus and priority” on the development of two-drug regimens, Mr. Witty said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">According to analysis by UBS, the opportunity is significant: If dual therapy becomes the strategy that doctors prefer, Glaxo could grab a much bigger slice of the market and overtake Gilead Sciences Inc. to become the biggest player in HIV treatment within three years.

</span>Over the past year, Glaxo has started several large clinical trials that aim to show that combining dolutegravir with just one other HIV medicine works as well as traditional triple therapy at suppressing the virus.

In one set of trials, it is testing dolutegravir alongside rilpivirine, a brand-name HIV drug made by Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals. In another, it is combining dolutegravir with 3TC, the generic drug used in Dr. Walensky’s analysis.

It also plans to start a late-stage trial combining an injectable version of dolutegravir with rilpivirine. An earlier trial showed this combination was as effective as a three-drug regimen when the virus had already been suppressed by an initial period of triple therapy.

The trials won’t start yielding results until next year, but a small study led by Pedro Cahn, a doctor in Argentina, offers some reason for optimism. In that 48-week trial, dolutegravir plus 3TC suppressed HIV levels <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 18 out</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 previously</span> untreated patients.

Even if Glaxo’s large clinical trials succeed, it could face another challenge: inertia.

In the past year, Gilead has launched a series of triple therapies using a new HIV drug called TAF that can be administered at a much lower dose than its predecessor, causing less harm to the kidneys.

Christoph Wyen, an HIV specialist at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, said the advent of these less-toxic triple therapies reduces the incentive for doctors to switch patients to simpler regimens. He said dual therapy might take off more quickly in older patients, who are more likely to have age-related health complications.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Gilead and Glaxo both have strong positions in the HIV market with TAF- and dolutegravir-based triple regimens, respectively.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But Gilead is developing a new integrase inhibitor that, if proven equal to dolutegravir, could give it an important advantage in the triple-therapy market.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The worst-case scenario for Glaxo would be for its dual therapies to fail and for Gilead’s integrase inhibitor—which, if successful, is expected to launch in 2018—to steal market share from dolutegravir.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That could send Glaxo’s HIV business into decline <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2018,</span> according to UBS, though Mr. Witty says that the downside is limited because dolutegravir will be well-established by the time Gilead’s competitor comes along.

</span>“It’s not a foregone conclusion that [dual therapy] is going to work,” said Dr. Hardy. But “I’ve watched the development of dolutegravir enough to understand why they are trying to do this.”

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,5923,"<h3>From Outsider to Insider: Karen Bass’s Unexpected Journey to Power</h3>LOS ANGELES — <span id=""0"" class=""red""><span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> as California confronted its most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression, the center of power in the state capital was a tent.</span> It was set up in the courtyard outside the office of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California’s most influential players — mostly white men — went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.
But not Karen Bass.
Newly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“‘I guess you probably don’t want to be doing business here,’” the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> “He didn’t know what to do. And that was right. I didn’t want to be in the tent.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation’s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.
</span>“They didn’t know what to make of me,” she said.
Today Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-’em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who — like the men in that tent in Sacramento — are now trying to figure out what to make of her.
And of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden — in the story of her life and the story of her politics — as the Democratic congresswoman from California.
Ms. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.
Ms. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of Ms. Bass’s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.
</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.
[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]
In many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party’s candidate for vice president. She talks more about conciliation than confrontation and does not have as many detractors as some of her rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ms. Bass’s advocacy of liberal positions on criminal justice, poverty, housing, foster care and welfare could provide a Biden-Bass ticket a lift with progressive and younger voters.</span> She would arguably be the most liberal politician chosen for vice president since Jimmy Carter tapped Walter F. Mondale as his running mate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1976.</span>
But her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.
In the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro’s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that “the passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.” Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.
Ms. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro “Comandante en Jefe,” a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. “Wouldn’t do that again,” she said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Talked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn’t have been said.”
She said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. “Now, that doesn’t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,” she said.
Chapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.
In one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, “Just so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.”
Back in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office — not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.
And certainly not for vice president.
“Oh God, no!” she said. “There isn’t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.”
As Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.
“When a woman is in a role that’s new, people underestimate,” she said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“You need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?”
‘I felt like I had failed a generation’
As she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.
After graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.
While elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis — hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.
“What she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people — she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.
What made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.
For young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don’t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.
At the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1991.</span>
Ms. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change — “finally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,” she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.
“I felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn’t gotten change,” she said.
In the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.
<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.
One of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.
“The crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,” said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass’s. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“She knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.”
Ms. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city — drugs, crime, poverty — in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.
</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.
Then, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly. The outside player was ready to move to the inside.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Crafting a way out of fiscal crisis
California was sliding into crisis — <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $41 billion</span> deficit, larger than the entire budget of many states — when Ms. Bass was elected speaker in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2008.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">For the next two years, she and other legislative leaders struggled with Mr. Schwarzenegger over a punishing package of spending cuts and tax increases to rescue California from its worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.
</span>It also was a time of a tragedy in her life: <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2006,</span> her only daughter and her son-in-law were killed in a car crash, an echo of the loss Mr. Biden has experienced; his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1972.</span>
“I had a choice as to whether to go back to work or hide,” Ms. Bass said. “I had to embrace the grief and wrap myself in grief. People don’t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don’t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn’t ask to be a part of.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state’s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“It was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,” said Michael C. Genest, who was Mr. Schwarzenegger’s top financial adviser.</span> “The major dynamic was that Republicans wanted to cut, Democrats wanted to raise taxes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And the reality was we could never cut enough to balance the budget.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">And we could never raise taxes enough to balance the budget.”
</span>Democrats held a substantial majority in the Assembly and the Senate. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But passing a budget in California at the time required a vote by two-thirds of members of each chamber.</span> As a result, Republican leaders had significant power in the negotiations.
John A. Pérez, who succeeded Ms. Bass as speaker, said the dynamic of a minority party holding the votes needed to pass legislation greatly complicated her negotiations with the Senate and governor.
“But then she had the hard work of delivering the votes in the caucus,” he said. “And nobody goes to office to make cuts on programs they hold near and dear.”
Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.
“I thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,” he said. “She’s unabashedly a progressive, but she’s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.”
It was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden — the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.
“I would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,” said Fabian Núñez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. “She was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger’s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.
“She used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,” said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. “‘Gotta go to Gitmo.’”
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.
</span>“She was unflappable,” Mr. Steinberg said. “It was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.”
Ms. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.
“It was very devastating personally,” she said. “The whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.”
As Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today’s brutal political environment?
The No.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden’s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.
That said, Ms. Bass’s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.
“People use the word nice about her, if you notice,” Mr. Villaraigosa said. “But I think a better word is — she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.”
Ms. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice “as opposed to mean” and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, “Nice doesn’t mean I wouldn’t fight.”",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

</span>The administration will probably confront a tough fight for congressional approval next year, when the House of Representatives may be controlled by Democrats. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Touting large potential gains from a new trade deal — as President Bill Clinton did <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 when</span> he was promoting the North American Free Trade Agreement — will be a central part of the White House campaign.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“We all tend to overstate the impact of trade agreements,” said Mickey Kantor, who led the Clinton administration’s sales pitch for NAFTA, which Trump’s new deal would replace.</span> “You do that for political reasons. But all we do is open ourselves up to criticism and make ourselves look bad.”
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As economists and trade analysts sorted through <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,800</span>-plus pages of the new accord, they saw few signs of major change.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Lorenzo Caliendo, an economics professor at Yale University’s School of Management who co-authored a NAFTA study published <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 that</span> concluded each American had gained <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $45 a</span> year from that treaty, said the new agreement would “clearly not” return significant numbers of manufacturing jobs to the United States.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The limited differences between the new and old treaties, coupled with changes in the U.S. labor force over the past quarter-century, would minimize the economic benefits, Caliendo said.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Much of the work that has moved to Mexico <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> when the original deal took effect, would be ill-suited for the higher-skilled contemporary U.S. labor force, according to Caliendo.
</span>“I expect very small aggregate effects,” he wrote in an email.

Some of the gains may be important for individual industries or farmers but may not make much of a difference in the overall economy.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">The president has been especially critical of Canada’s dairy management system, which limits imports to protect domestic farmers’ incomes and has been a particular irritant for U.S. producers in states such as Wisconsin.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">As one of the final issues to be resolved, Canada agreed to open <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 3.5 percent</span> of its dairy market to U.S. farmers.
</span>The auto industry would face some of the biggest adjustments, illustrating how the deal would create winners and losers. The new agreement is widely expected to raise vehicle costs and create more onerous paperwork requirements, especially for the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 1 and</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 2 suppliers</span> that feed major automakers such as General Motors and Ford.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The Trump administration aims to return auto industry jobs to the United States.</span> To encourage that, the new deal stipulates that at <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 75 percent</span> of a vehicle — vs.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 62.5 percent</span> today — must be produced in the NAFTA region to qualify for duty-free treatment. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Another new provision requires at <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 40 percent</span> of each automobile to be made by workers <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $16 an</span> hour, far higher than Mexico’s average factory wage.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">“The new deal makes it harder to assemble a car in Mexico and export it to the United States and meet the requirements,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
</span>At the same time, he said, “carmakers are also less able to buy cheaper parts from European or Asian suppliers.”
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan predicts “tens of thousands” of jobs could return out <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 375,000 lost</span> over the past two decades but says American consumers would see sticker prices increase <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $470 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,200 per</span> vehicle.

</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">“We do not anticipate an increase in U.S. auto manufacturing employment.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Rather, it will result in an advance in the use of robotics and automation in Mexico,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at audit firm RSM.
</span>Such judgments are shared by key Democrats. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Rep. Sander M.

</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“If there’s a major change here, and I think there will be, it will be very difficult to try to push through this trade agreement,” Levin said.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,91360,"<h3>Fed Adopts Dodd-Frank Bailout Limits</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Rule required under financial overhaul restricts unchecked ability to lend to banks during crisis

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 4</span>:12 pm ET

The Federal Reserve on Monday adopted a rule curtailing its flexibility to rescue struggling firms during a crisis, seeking to assuage Capitol Hill concerns about the central bank’s broad and largely unchecked powers to pump money into the financial system.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The rule was required by <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Dodd</span>-Frank financial overhaul law, which directed the Fed to limit emergency lending to “broad-based” programs rather than to a select few institutions.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Many lawmakers had said the Fed operated with too few restrictions as it tried to keep big banks and other firms afloat during <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis, when the central bank used its emergency lending powers for the first time since the Great Depression.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Under the rule, the Fed would be able to use its emergency lending authority only to provide assistance to an entire market or sector of the economy, rather than to specific firms or other recipients.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That means the Fed wouldn’t be able to lend money to prop up a single failing firm or to keep one out of bankruptcy, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said, “such as was done with loans to Bear Stearns and AIG.”

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">In <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2008,</span> the Fed approved loan guarantees to allow J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to take over Bear Stearns, a Wall Street powerhouse that was on the verge of collapse.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">In September, a Fed loan bailed out American International Group Inc., a large insurance company that was also at risk of going under and dragging much of the financial system down with it.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Monday’s rule would, among other things, require that every new Fed lending program be designed broadly enough that at least five potential recipients could be eligible to participate.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That contrasts with several of the Fed’s rescue efforts during the crisis that were tailored for individual firms.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Fed officials said they copied the new requirement from legislation proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and David Vitter (R., La.), two of the most vocal critics of the Fed’s big bank bailouts.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed also would have to exclude insolvent institutions or entities from the loans and demand enough collateral to protect taxpayers.</span> Emergency lending programs would expire after one year, although the rule spells out provisions for extending them.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed had proposed an earlier version of the rule that several lawmakers deemed inadequate.</span> The tougher version approved Monday was aimed at addressing those concerns.

“We have received helpful and constructive comments from many sources on a rule to implement these Dodd-Frank Act provisions,” Ms. Yellen said in a statement. “In response to these comments, we have made significant changes to the proposed rule to ensure that our rule will be applied in a manner that aligns with the intent of the Congress and the Dodd-Frank Act.”

Responses from Congress were mixed. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Vitter called Monday’s announcement “the first real acknowledgment from the Fed that it needed to do more to curtail its own bailout authority.”

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">And Ms. Warren said she was glad the Fed adopted changes.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“These changes will help promote market discipline and make the financial system safer—but there are still loopholes that the Fed could exploit to provide another back-door bailout to giant financial institutions,” she said.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">But Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the central bank didn’t go far enough.</span> “By leaving the door wide open to future taxpayer-funded bailouts, this final rule compounds the moral hazard problem that lies at the core of ‘too big to fail,’” he said.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen, in her statement, defended the Fed’s emergency lending authority, calling it “a critical tool for responding to broad and unusual market stresses.”

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,40013,"<h3>Steep Oil and Strong Dollar Make Toxic Brew for Global Economies</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">For Americans, rising oil prices are threatening $3-a-gallon gasoline and pushing up prices for plane tickets.</span> In many other parts of the world, today’s crude rally is more painful—sparking protests, gas lines and emergency subsidies to quell unrest.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">That is because many consumers outside the U.S. face a double whammy when—like now—the dollar gets stronger at the same time that oil prices rise.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While petroleum is produced all over the globe, when it is sold to refiners and other buyers it is almost always priced in dollars.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">It is, in the words of Brazilian Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia, “a challenging external scenario.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">After Brazil’s military brought an end to a crippling strike by truck drivers over high fuel prices, Mr. Guardia called the oil rally “brutal” for his country.
</span>Brazil is among the handful of oil-dependent countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia that have turned to costly fuel subsidies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Across swaths of Africa, higher fuel costs and weakening local currencies have hit prices for food and electronics.
</span>Fast-rising crude, on its own, has been pressuring global growth for months. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Swiss bank UBS figures that today’s international crude price, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $75 a</span> barrel, would boost global inflation by more than half a percentage point, compared with <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $50 barrels</span> the world enjoyed as recently as last year.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Brent crude, the international benchmark, has eased off a recent 3½-year high of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $80,</span> on expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will boost output when it meets this week.</span> Before that retreat, oil was up more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20% this</span> year.
There are global winners, along with losers. The U.S., squeezed over the decades in past oil rallies, is looking pretty comfortable this time. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">In recent years, America has boosted production significantly, making it much less dependent on imports.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Overall economic growth in big crude producers like the U.S. and Canada could rise by almost a third of a percentage point with today’s prices, says UBS.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In import-heavy economies like China and the eurozone, however, growth could slip a tenth of a percentage point, UBS figures.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That may not sound like a significant hit overall, but fuel prices can be particularly painful for specific swaths of any economy.</span> This month, Chinese truckers refused to move goods and blocked roads in a handful of cities, protesting higher fuel costs.
Exacerbating the pain in many countries is a strengthening dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar compared with a basket <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 16 major</span> currencies, has <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">strengthened 6% since</span> February.
In Europe, dollar strength against the euro has helped make crude today <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30% more</span> expensive than when oil was at a low in February.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">For European consumers, gasoline-price shocks are often dampened by the continent’s generally steep taxes on the fuel.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That makes the cost of oil a smaller percentage of the overall price of a liter of gas.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">This year’s price increase, though, has been so steep that many drivers are feeling the squeeze.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices in Britain rose faster in May than in any month on record, according to RAC, a drivers’ lobby group, which called it a “hellish month.”</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A lower pound against the dollar and higher oil prices were a “toxic combination,” an RAC spokesman said.
</span>“I fill up two or three times a week. I feel it,” said Cristinel Bulai, an Uber driver in London. “When, in one year, every month you see a little bit more, you say, ‘whoa, whoa.’<span id=""17"" class=""red"">”
Brent crude is still well below the $100-plus a barrel it fetched <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 through</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> and prices probably aren’t high enough to knock the European economy from its recent upward trajectory.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Still, the oil and dollar rally act like a tax, limiting consumers’ discretionary spending.</span> That threatens a pullback in consumption that can eventually hit growth. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">It can also feed into inflation and pressure central banks to boost borrowing rates.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Inflation in Spain jumped to an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">annualized 2.2% last</span> year from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.2% in</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> largely due to higher energy prices.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The pain has been greatest in economies where dollar strength has been even more pronounced.</span> In Brazil, gasoline is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 28% and</span> diesel fuel for trucks more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 27% over</span> the past year. The Brazilian real has <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 11% this</span> year against the dollar.
The two-week strike by Brazilian truckers stranded goods across the country, triggering warnings about possible shortages from grocery stores, hospitals and McDonald’s outlets. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">To end the walkout, President Michel Temer rolled out the military and promised <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">truckers $3 billion</span> in diesel-fuel subsides and tax cuts.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Brazil’s government has restricted how often fuel suppliers can raise prices, at once a month.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">As energy prices rose, economists polled by the central bank slashed a full percentage point of growth off Brazil’s forecast output this year, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%.</span>
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In Indonesia, where the rupiah has fallen to its weakest level against the dollar in more than two years, fuel prices are an election issue.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">President Joko Widodo has promised not to raise prices of subsidized fuels and electricity <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2019,</span> when he is expected to run for a second term.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In April, he required fuel retailers, including foreign firms Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA, to seek government approval before raising prices they charge at the pump.
</span>Jakarta also said it would dramatically increase diesel subsidies. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Thailand and Malaysia—where newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed made it a campaign pledge—have both ramped up spending to stabilize pump prices.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">“Governments are promising to cap fuel prices to win votes and elections,” said Hak Bin Chua, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng in Singapore.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">While Africa is a big oil producer, much of the continent is energy-poor and dependent on imports—and several governments are also contending with pressure on their currencies.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">In Nigeria, the continent’s biggest crude exporter, a government cap on what drivers pay at the pump has led to gasoline shortages as retailers struggle to pay for refined fuel imports.

HAMPTON, S.C.—The saga of disgraced South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh includes five deaths, millions of dollars allegedly absconded from clients and, in July, indictments accusing him of murdering his wife and son, to which he pleaded not guilty.

It also spawned a pair of explosive and potentially groundbreaking lawsuits, with one tentatively set to go to trial this fall.

On one side sits the family of Mallory Beach, a 19-year-old killed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 when</span> a boat driven by Mr. Murdaugh’s late son, Paul, crashed into a bridge to Parris Island. On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach’s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.

Mr. Parker denies his company’s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.

Mr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker’s Kitchen chain <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family’s assets are frozen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl’s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.

</span>“I’ve <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I’m really, really proud of,” Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won’t settle the case, because to settle would be “to have Parker’s name besmirched.”

“That’s what’s wrong with America now,” he said. “People should stand up for what’s right. And I’m standing up for the truth.”

The wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.

The litigation so far hasn’t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family’s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.

</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker’s team improperly plied a boat passenger’s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker’s team and a crisis communications firm.

Mr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker “for everything he’s got” because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker’s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.

“I can prove everything he did and I’m going to, and he’s going to write me a big check,” Mr. Tinsley said.

Power in county

The boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing.

</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor’s, or district attorney’s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family’s close working relationship with local law enforcement.

Before he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.

Based on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh’s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span>

In the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 7,</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh’s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The state’s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides “the background and the motive” for the double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. “It’s an incredible tragedy,” he said. “But we’re not responsible.”

Mr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul’s slight build didn’t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother’s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.

“When you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don’t even read the information on the ID, it’s apparent what’s going to happen,” Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren’t rigorously followed at Parker’s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.

</span>Night of drinking

The fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span>

Paul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker’s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III’s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.

Video footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver’s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander “Buster” Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $49 on</span> his mother’s credit card.

After Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.

The six young people met at Paul’s grandfather’s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast—a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry—at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.

On the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn’t have running lights. Just <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.

Several passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, “screaming, cussing and saying horrible things,” according to court documents.

At 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn’t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.

It took a week to find Ms. Beach’s body, which was facedown in the <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.

Paul’s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.

Mr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory’s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker’s company.

The hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.

Alex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach’s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.

That left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.

The wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.

Quirk in liability law

Mr. Parker,<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and “Chewy Ice,” which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.

As Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh’s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh’s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.

Ms. Cohen “takes the driver’s license,” Mr. Parker said. “She looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.” Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother’s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach’s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn’t follow other company policies.

“They’ve got great written policies,” Mr. Tinsley said. “If they did what they said they were going to do, I don’t think this happens.”

Mr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.

Ms. Cohen isn’t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.

Alcohol-enforcement authorities haven’t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen “did her due diligence,” by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">State law doesn’t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.

</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.

“You say ‘Well, wait a minute. If I’m one-millionth <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% liable</span>?’ ” said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. “How does that work? That’s not fair.” He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.

The law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.

In December<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Mr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker’s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.

Mr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker’s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.

Super Bowl party

Rhett Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.

When asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, “Not that she knows of.” He added, “They had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.”

Mr. Parker said he can’t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said “we sure as heck wouldn’t have directed anybody to break the law,” including by buying alcohol for someone underage.

Mr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker’s investigation wouldn’t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn’t the cause of the boat crash. “There’s only one conclusion,” he said in an interview. Mr. Parker’s side was “collecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.”

A lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.

The suit also alleges that Mr. Parker’s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach’s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.

Mr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker’s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.

The suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for “Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,” a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.

Ms. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that “whoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules” and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.

Mr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn’t seek the family’s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.

In December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.

Edward Fenno, Ms. Ward’s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward’s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.

The completed “Murdaugh Murders” documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn’t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach’s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker’s legal team but haven’t made public.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.

“We were trying to find out who and what we were up against,” Mr. Parker said.

Mr. Parker said he didn’t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn’t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach’s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker’s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.

Mr. Roman published <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward’s documentary. Mr. Parker’s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman’s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker’s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.

Mr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were “engaged to gather information for news purposes” and not part of a conspiracy.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh’s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer’s double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family’s influence.

“When I look back on this [investigation], do I think ‘Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn’t have done that?’ ” Mr. Parker said. “Absolutely not. I’m proud of the work we did.”

When asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. “Here’s a better question,” he said. “ ‘So what?’ Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.”

As to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, “which was pretty easy to do.” He added: “This life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.”

Mr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.

The outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker’s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker’s lawyers say <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.

Mr. Donehue’s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker’s team in the spring <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span> “Mr. Parker’s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,” Ms. Senn said in an email. “I hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.”

Mr. Parker’s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.

Mr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker’s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.

Layers of connections

Some of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina’s close-knit legal community.

Mr. Tinsley,<span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden’s ambassador to Slovenia.

Mr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group—unrelated to Mr. Parker—including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.

Mr. Parker’s team includes some of the state’s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump’s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.

Mr. Parker’s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook’s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach’s boyfriend and Mr. Cook’s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.

In a preview of Mr. Parker’s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj “P.K.” Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker’s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach’s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn’t, according to depositions.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.

</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook’s lawsuit. “He said I’m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of Jägermeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I’m responsible?”

Joe McCulloch, Mr. Cook’s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. “Mutiny on the Bounty wouldn’t have ended well for anybody,” Mr. McCulloch said.

South Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn’t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. “Very few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,” Mr. McCulloch said. “His willingness to point the finger isn’t surprising.”

Mr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker’s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.

</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker’s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.

</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was “looking into how the association would fit in” with the coalition’s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn’t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 54 of</span><span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.

State Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn’t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn’t benefit the public.

There was a time, not all that long ago, when the NFL seemed on the verge of expanding its playoff field <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 12 to</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14 teams</span>.
Then it didn’t happen. Not then. Not now.
Or at least not yet.
So what’s the deal? Will it ever happen?
That’s a very definite maybe.
In <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2014,</span> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the expanded playoffs to take effect in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>.
“I do believe it will be approved for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>[season],” Goodell said then.
[From May 2014: Roger Goodell expects the NFL to expand its playoffs beginning in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 </span>season</span>]
He also said at that point: “I think we want to see one more year of, ‘Will it impact the regular season in a positive way from a competitive standpoint? Will it create more excitement, more races towards the end about who’s going to qualify for the playoffs?’ And we also want to absorb the additional inventory into the marketplace from an advertising standpoint. We’ll be able to do that. … So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that’s how we’re going to approach it.”
But then it didn’t happen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest.</span> And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.
[From February 2015: Support erodes for expanded NFL playoffs]
That doesn’t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It’s been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league’s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 CBA</span>.</span> The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players’ approval.
But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.
Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.
But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allowing 44 percent</span> of the league into the postseason rather than the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 38 percent</span>. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.
Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn’t mean that.
At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">either 17 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 games</span>, could be reconsidered, although the players’ approval remains the obvious obstacle there. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the expanded postseason could be reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The current labor deal runs <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2020,</span> and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.
… AND TEN<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
1.</span></span> Seahawks say no to Kaepernick … The Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They’d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.
[Kaepernick-to-the-Seahawks made a lot of sense]<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
2.</span> Next for Kaepernick?… It now becomes a waiting game for Kaepernick. Teams are into their offseason programs and there is no catalyst, it seems, to prompt a signing sooner rather than later. It now appears likely that it will be at least into training camp before a team reconsiders its quarterback options and Kaepernick becomes an alternative somewhere.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
3.</span></span> What about RGIII?<span id=""4"" class=""red"">… If Kaepernick can’t get a job, are there any prospects for Robert Griffin III?</span> Could a team justify passing up Kaepernick, coming off a 16-touchdown, four-interception season in San Francisco, in favor of Griffin, coming off a two-touchdown, three-interception season in Cleveland?
Of course, teams justified signing quarterbacks such as Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Fitzpatrick instead of Kaepernick. So perhaps signing Griffin wouldn’t be too much of a stretch.<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
4.</span> Seahawks’ strife … The Seahawks have done their best to try to dismiss the report by ESPN The Magazine about internal strife stemming from cornerback Richard Sherman’s inability to let go of the ill-fated play call on the goal line that led to Wilson’s Super Bowl-losing interception against the New England Patriots. Fine. It probably won’t be an issue if the Seahawks have a successful season. But if things don’t go so well, it won’t be as easy for them to put this aside.
[Yes, it was the worst play call in Super Bowl history]<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
5.</span> Ravens’ OTA injuries … Injuries obviously are part of football. But nothing is worse than injuries occurring in offseason practices. The Baltimore Ravens have been particularly hard hit this offseason with the torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered by cornerback Tavon Young and the hip injury, reportedly career threatening, suffered by tight end Dennis Pitta. Little to nothing is won in the NFL during the offseason. But plenty can be lost.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">6. Offseason restrictions … Keep such injuries in mind the next time NFL coaches talk about the need to roll back some of the restrictions on offseason practices put in place in the last labor deal.</span> The NFL Players Association is very, very unlikely to agree to any rollbacks of those restrictions.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
7.</span> On Norman … Josh Norman’s recent comments to Bleacher Report about Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr. were relatively tame, by his standards. Norman can say what he wants. But, really, has he played well enough since moving from the Carolina Panthers to the Washington Redskins to justify such inflammatory remarks? Not really taking a stand on that. Just wondering.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">
8.</span> On Cruz … Norman’s comments came nowhere close to those made recently by Victor Cruz, however, after the veteran wide receiver signed with the Chicago Bears. Does Cruz really believe that the New York Giants purposefully suppressed his pass-catching numbers to make it easier to release him? This was a team that was starved for offensive production after a successful remake of its defense. If Cruz really believes that, he is deluding himself badly.
[Victor Cruz felt Giants intentionally kept <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2016 production</span> down. Former coach disagrees.]<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 5,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET

WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Fears that the El Niño weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.

</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Niño is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Niño will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yields for Australian wheat—which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">comprise 14% of</span> the world’s exports—could fall as much <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.

El Niño occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Niño event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.

</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">El Niño caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.

</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be. Of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 26 El</span> Niño weather patterns observed <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1900,</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 17 resulted</span> in widespread droughts in Australia, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology.

“Every El Niño is different, including its duration and intensity, as is its impact on agricultural production,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They said the price impact could be deepest for robusta coffee—used in instant coffee—raw sugar and wheat, crops grown in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil that are likely to be affected by El Niño.

</span>Garry Hansen, a farmer who grows wheat as well as raises cattle and sheep on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8,000</span>-hectare farm in Coomandook in southern Australia, is already concerned about the area’s dryness. The region has had little rain over the last two years.

“We don’t have a lot of moisture in the bank and we are a little bit worried about the forecast. We could do with the rain,” said Mr. Hansen, who added June’s rainfall was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20% of</span> its normal level. He said making sure there were no weeds taking water away from the wheat crop was one of the few things he could do to combat El Niño.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“You have to manage the business like it is going to rain but you also have to maximize water efficiency,” said Mr. Hansen.

Wheat exported from Brisbane on Australia’s eastern coast, near to farmland that could be most affected by El Niño, is already trading at a premium of more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% to</span> wheat shipped from Adelaide in South Australia, said Rob Imray, managing director at commodity marketing firm Farmarco Australia.

</span>It may take a few months before El Niño’s impact is felt in other agricultural commodities. Palm-oil harvests will be affected by drier weather, but the extent won’t be visible until six months after El Niño occurs, Singapore-based Golden Agri-Resources, the second-largest producer of the commodity, said in an email.

“As El Niño has just started, it is currently too early to estimate production output <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2016,</span>” the company said. It said palm-oil farmers could apply fertilizer to their land earlier than normal to help counter any worsening of weather conditions.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">El Niño could boost trading firms that act as middlemen between buyers and sellers of food.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such firms tend to profit more when commodity prices are volatile—provided they read weather and market conditions correctly.

</span>“We are watching [the situation] like a hawk and we will see what happens,” Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Singapore-based trader Olam, said earlier this year. He said El Niño could lead to shortages of wheat, corn and sugar in some Southern Hemisphere countries, although higher rainfall could help crops elsewhere.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Market fears about the impact of El Niño have eased due to a good start to the monsoon season in India and Bangladesh, said Aurelia Britsch, senior commodities analyst at BMI Research.</span> The monsoon season has brought more rain than normal despite earlier forecasts that India’s rainfall would be down <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 12%,</span> while the weather in northern parts of Asia has been broadly in line with historical averages.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Any upward pressure on food prices from El Niño could also be offset by ample stocks of several commodities, particularly of rice, palm oil and sugar, some analysts say.

</span>And while dry conditions could weigh on crop yields in Asia, wetter weather caused by El Niño in South America could boost crops of soybeans, corn and sugar there.

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 11</span>:29 am ET

The meal-kit market keeps getting bigger: Consumers can now opt for organic meal kits (Sun Basket), Southern meal kits (Peach Dish) and even Tom Brady-inspired vegan meal kits (TB12).</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This summer, Amazon got into the $5-billion-a-year business, offering kits that include all the ingredients you need to make, say, a veggie burger with harissa aioli and smoked eggplant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 30 minutes</span>.</span> So far, the kits are available only in Seattle and only to subscribers to Amazon Fresh, the company’s grocery service. Its slogan: “We do the prep. You be the chef.”

There’s only one problem: Americans don’t want to cook and never really have. Despite the nostalgic halo around home cooking, we have always seen mealtime mostly as a hurdle to clear, not as a cherished tradition. “Americans know the value of time too well to waste it at the table,” noted a visitor from England in a travel journal—<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1794.</span>

One invention after another has been designed to make feeding ourselves faster and easier, from the automated mill to frozen food, the drive-through to the microwave. And once women—who used to do all the cooking—had the opportunity (and the need) to work outside the home, the home-cooked meal was finished, at least as the daily anchor of domestic life.

In surveys, Americans say that they enjoy cooking, but they clearly don’t want to do too much of it. <span id=""2"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 2016,</span> the amount of time that women spent cooking had fallen to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 37 minutes</span> a day, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span> The Hartman Group, a food consulting firm, found that more than half of dinners in the U.S. are planned less than an hour before they are eaten. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst of the market-research firm NPD Group, predicts that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2026 less</span> than half the main dishes served for dinner at home will be made from scratch.

</span>The promise of meal kits was to finally make cooking easy enough that Americans would actually do it. Proponents hoped that a cooking revival also could ease the nation’s obesity crisis—a way to reclaim control of what we eat from the big food manufacturers and restaurant chains.

Early meal-kit entrepreneurs chased affluent, urban consumers who love farmers markets and fantasize about having a backyard chicken coop. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">These customers have disposable time and income and believe that they need to cook—both to be healthy and to distinguish themselves as engaged consumers.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Market leader Blue Apron, for instance, touts its sustainable sourcing and showcases exotic ingredients, like fairy-tale eggplants, in dishes such as quinoa tabbouleh with toasted pine nuts and yogurt sauce.

</span>Still, the amount of cooking required has apparently been too much, even for the farm-to-table crowd. (So much chopping!) <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Industry analysts believe that meal-kit purveyors are having trouble retaining customers, and Blue Apron has seen its stock price slide since its IPO in late June.

</span>The companies are only now starting to acknowledge the truth about the American home cook. Blue Apron recently introduced recipes that are faster to prepare. Amazon and other more recent entrants such as FreshRealm, Gobble and Terra’s Kitchen are going further, dialing back the prep work to almost zero. An Amazon recipe for catfish includes pre-made guacamole, already shucked corn and pre-sliced jalapeños. Tovala, launched in July, requires no cooking at all: The meals arrive prepared in aluminum trays. All you do is scan the bar code on the package, and the custom-made “smart oven” (yours for just $399) will bake, broil or steam it to perfection.

Americans talk a good game about the importance of home cooking and family meals, but we still want convenience above all. To succeed, meal kits won’t just have to be easier than starting from scratch; they will have to be as easy as takeout. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">For Amazon, that might mean tweaking that clever slogan for its meal-kit business: “We do the prep.</span> You pretend to be the chef.”

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 4</span>:09 pm ET

The Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates in mid-December so long as the U.S. economy remains on track, Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed expects that “the economy will continue to grow at a pace that is sufficient to generate further improvements in the labor market and to return inflation to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">our 2% target</span> over the medium term, and if the incoming information supports that expectation, then...</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">December would be a live possibility,” Ms. Yellen said while testifying before the House Financial Services Committee.</span> “But importantly, we’ve made no decision about it.”

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Her remarks were echoed later Wednesday by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley, who serves as vice chairman of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.</span> Mr. Dudley, too, described December as a “live possibility” for a rate increase and added, “but let’s see what the data shows.”

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed has kept its benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal-funds rate, pinned near zero since <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2008.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Fed’s policy committee decided to hold rates near zero in mid-September but signaled in a statement last week that a rate increase was possible “at its next meeting” on Dec. 15-16.

</span>On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen reinforced that message. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">She described the U.S. economy as “pretty strong and growing at a solid pace” despite some weakness “spilling over to us from the global economy.”</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">She repeated that raising rates soon would allow the Fed to tighten monetary policy at a gradual pace; in a speech in late September, she warned delay could force the Fed to raise rates more quickly and possibly push the economy into recession.

</span>“Moving in a timely fashion, if the data and the outlook justify such a move, is a prudent thing to do because we will be able to move at a more gradual and measured pace,” Ms. Yellen told lawmakers. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We fully expect that the economy will evolve in such a way that we can move at a very gradual pace, and of course, after we do so, we will be watching very carefully whether our expectations are realized.”

Fed governor Lael Brainard last month called for caution on raising rates, citing weakness overseas and persistently low domestic inflation.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">As measured by the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index, U.S. inflation has undershot the central bank’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% annual</span> target for more than three years.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen, referring Wednesday to Ms. Brainard’s remarks, told lawmakers that “if we were to move, say in December, it would be based on an expectation—which I believe is justified—that with an improving labor market and transitory factors fading, that inflation will move up <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%.</span></span> But of course if we were to move, we would need to verify over time that expectation was being realized, and if not, adjust policy appropriately.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">In projections released in September, one unnamed Fed policy maker recommended lowering the benchmark fed-funds rate into negative territory.</span> Ms. Yellen said at the time that the idea wasn’t under serious consideration and on Wednesday reiterated that she doesn’t see the need for such a move. But she did leave the door open to considering it in the future.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">If the economic outlook “were to deteriorate in a significant way so that we thought we needed to provide more support to the economy, then potentially anything—including negative interest rates—would be on the table,” she said.</span> “But we would have to study carefully how they would work here in the U.S.”

Businesses pump water from aquifers in New Zealand and Australia, prompting protests
On the east coast of New Zealand, a Chinese-owned company has been pumping increasing amounts of water from a local aquifer to quench growing demand among consumers for high-end spring water.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Sales of bottled water by OnePure International Group have grown exponentially since it opened for business five years ago, and most of its products are shipped to China and other parts of Asia.</span> Last year it pumped close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3 million</span> gallons of spring water from below one of New Zealand’s prime wine-growing districts, to the chagrin of some in the local community.
“We are worried it could become problematic,” said Leanne Cotter-Arlidge, who runs a nonprofit in Hawke’s Bay, the region where OnePure and six other bottled-water operations have been tapping aquifers. The concern, she said, is that the companies will extract too much water and deprive cities and farms in the area of a valuable resource. Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.
OnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China’s growing market.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">China currently consumes <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world’s supply of the product, according to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 20 gallons</span>—or <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles—a year, and analysts expect the country’s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.
</span>Water resources within China are limited. The country <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 20% of</span> the world’s population and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 7% of</span> the world’s fresh water. Around one-quarter of that is polluted—in part because of industrial production and intensive farming practices—according to a January report from China National Environmental Monitoring Center.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">As people care more about the quality of tap water, they are more likely to turn to bottled water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.
</span>Four of <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The country’s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2013 and</span><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade data.
</span>New Zealand has become an attractive destination for Chinese companies that want to use the country’s environmentally pristine image to sell bottled water. A few years ago, the country’s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country’s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.
<span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> Nongfu’s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country’s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.
The plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community’s own needs.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“This is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,” it said.
</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand’s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean’s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We need to protect our water supply for our community,” said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“If there wasn’t the potential for such growth in demand…no one would be panicking.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">“It’s a very competitive market,” Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com’s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,66212,"<h3>Primary Elections Results Live: Latest News from PA, NC, OR, KY, and ID</h3>Latest Developments
Republican Rep. Ted Budd on Tuesday won his party’s nomination for North Carolina’s open seat in the U.S. Senate as voters in five states cast ballots in primary elections that will provide the latest test of former President Donald Trump’s influence within the Republican Party.
Here are some of the key races to watch:
Kentucky (Polls closed <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6 p</span>.m. ET): The Associated Press made some early calls. Incumbents Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie were declared the winners in their GOP primaries.
Pennsylvania (Polls closed <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8 p</span>.m. ET): In the Republican Senate primary, little-funded Kathy Barnette has pulled within reach of two leading contenders, celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormick, who spent tens of millions of dollars. On the Democratic side, John Fetterman is the front-runner but suffered a stroke last week and is now recovering.
North Carolina (Polls closed at 7:30 p.m. ET): Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who has Mr. Trump’s backing, is in a challenging race to stay in Congress after a series of blunders.
Oregon (Polls close <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 p</span>.m. ET): Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the centrist group known as Blue Dog Democrats, is running for an eighth term. His challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, is running to his political left.
Idaho (Polls close <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. ET): The state’s Republican governor is defending his seat against a challenge from the state’s Trump-backed lieutenant governor.
Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has jumped out to an early lead in the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania.
With under a quarter of the vote counted, Mr. Fetterman <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 52.8% of</span> the vote, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 31.7% for</span> U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 11.1% for</span> state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
The race was shaken on Sunday when Mr. Fetterman, said that he was recovering from a stroke that would keep him in the hospital at least through Election Day. His campaign said he cast his vote from the hospital using an emergency absentee ballot on Tuesday, and underwent a procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. The campaign said late Tuesday that it was successful, and Mr. Fetterman was recovering well.
In a closely watched GOP primary, North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn is trailing State Sen. Chuck Edwards but the race remains too close to call. Mr. Cawthorn, whose political future was in peril after he lost support from grassroots groups in his district and many prominent Republican lawmakers, got a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump on Monday.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Cawthorn had made “foolish mistakes, which I don’t believe he’ll make again.” He added: “Let’s give Madison a second chance!”
Mr. Edwards has the backing of the state’s Republican establishment, including Sen. Thom Tillis, as well as many prominent state lawmakers.
With about half of the votes counted in the crowded field, Mr. Edwards <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 36.9%,</span> while Mr. Cawthorn <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 28.8%.</span>
Rep. Ted Budd will become the Republican nominee for Senate in North Carolina, according to an Associated Press projection.
Mr. Budd, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 50,</span> had the backing of former President Trump and Club for Growth in the 11-way primary, which boosted him in the primary that included former Rep. Mark Walker and former Gov. Pat McCrory.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The North Carolina native grew up working on his family's cattle and chicken farm and for their janitorial and landscaping business.</span> He was a businessman before being elected to the House of Representatives <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> He was one <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 147 Republicans</span> who opposed certifying the election results after the Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span> at the Capitol.
With about a quarter of the total votes counted, Mr. Budd had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 56% of</span> the vote.
In the general election, Mr. Budd will face off against Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. She easily won her primary.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as competitive, though leaning Republican. The winning candidate will fill the seat vacated by Sen. Richard Burr, who is retiring.
Correction: Ted Budd won the GOP Senate primary in North Carolina. The initial headline incorrectly said he won the GOP governor primary.
Polls are starting close, and the Associated Press made some early calls in races with little competition. Kentucky incumbent Sen. Rand Paul was declared the winner in his GOP primary. With <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> votes counted, he led with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 86% of</span> the vote.
Next up in races to watch: Polls close at 7:30 in North Carolina <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8 p</span>.m. in Pennsylvania.
Polls close in Idaho <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. ET.
Republican Gov. Brad Little is facing off against his lieutenant governor, fellow Republican Janice McGeachin, in an unusually bitter intraparty battle.
Mr. Little is one of several mainstream conservative Republicans in Idaho who are facing challenges from the right-wing faction of the party in this solidly conservative state. Whoever wins the GOP primary is expected to easily win the governor’s seat in November.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">At stake is the future direction of the Idaho Republican Party, which has been riven by divisions between those who support former president Donald Trump and those with more traditionally conservative views on social and fiscal issues.
</span>It will also provide a test of the power of an endorsement from Mr. Trump, who is backing Ms. McGeachin over the incumbent.
A poll published last month by the Idaho Dispatch showed Mr. Little with the support <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 60% of</span> likely GOP primary voters, compared <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 29% for</span> Ms. McGeachin.
Mr. Little and Ms. McGeachin have clashed publicly since he was elected <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> She used her temporary powers as acting governor when he was out-of-state to issue executive orders that barred local governments from applying Covid-19 mask and vaccine mandates. Mr. Little reversed those orders upon his return.
Ms. McGeachin campaigned on promises to prohibit the “medical tyranny” of vaccine requirements and has urged state legislators to remove exceptions for reasons such as rape, incest and the mother’s health from the state’s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which Mr. Little signed in March. Last month, Idaho Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law as legal challenges continue.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Little touted the fact that he has presided over record budget surpluses, cut taxes, and increased funding for schools.
</span>The Senate campaign of Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he underwent a procedure Tuesday to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. The campaign said Mr. Fetterman ""has been given the all-clear that it was successful"" and he was recovering well.
Earlier, his campaign released a photo of Mr. Fetterman casting his vote from Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital using an emergency absentee ballot.
Mr. Fetterman’s wife had urged him to go to the hospital on Friday after he wasn’t feeling well, according to a statement released Sunday. He said that his stroke was caused by a clot stemming from atrial fibrillation, or afib, an irregular or often rapid heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications.
Democrats in Oregon’s new 6th Congressional District will choose their nominee from a packed field that has seen more <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $13 million</span> in outside spending.
More <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $12 million</span> has been spent in support of first time candidate Carrick Flynn, who most recently advised the government on pandemic response. Most of that money,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10 million</span>, has come from a PAC backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old billionaire who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The group’s association with Mr. Bankman-Fried was first reported by Politico.
The PAC aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) also spent <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $1 million</span> to boost Mr. Flynn, arguing he was the strongest candidate in a general election.
The heavy spending has caused frustration with some Democrats who believe state Rep. Andrea Salinas is better qualified and more representative of what the Democratic party stands for. The state’s Democratic governor has endorsed Ms. Salinas.
More <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.5 million</span> has been spent on behalf of Ms. Salinas, <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $1 million</span> from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Bold PAC.

</span>A handful of Republican voters in the former steel town of Aliquippa, Pa., said that former President Donald Trump’s endorsements in the Senate and gubernatorial races played a major role in helping them choose which candidate to back in crowded fields.
In the governor’s race, Jon Keirs,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 36,</span> who voted at the St. George Byzantine Catholic Church in Aliquippa, said Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Mastriano, along with critical words the former president had for another candidate, pushed him to back Mr. Mastriano.
Mr. Keirs, who described himself as a stay-at-home-dad, said that listening to a video of Mr. Mastriano outlining his policies sealed his decision.
At the same time, Mr. Keirs said he wasn’t swayed by state GOP leaders who said Mr. Mastriano is too far right to beat Democrat Josh Shapiro in November.
“They say he’s the least electable, but I’m not sure I buy that,” Mr. Keirs said. “I get the argument that he’s so MAGA and right-wing that he’s unelectable. I think a lot of Pennsylvanian voters like that. Not because it’s radical but because it hits the values closest to home.”
In the Senate race, Mr. Keirs said he ultimately chose Republican Dave McCormick over Mehmet Oz, Mr. Trump’s chosen candidate. In this case, Mr. Keirs said the former president’s endorsement was blunted by that of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others who backed Mr. McCormick.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Do I think the celebrity is going to bring positive cultural change, or do I think the business guy is going to bring positive economic change?”</span> Mr. Keirs said. “I kind of felt that McCormick would do better in the long run.”
Meanwhile, several Democrats said they voted for Rep. Conor Lamb in the Democratic primary, saying they were drawn to his more moderate policies and demeanor compared to rival John Fetterman.
“He’s moderate and has the best chance of winning the state,” Olga Bobish,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 73,</span> a retired teacher, said of Mr. Lamb. At the same time, she said she would support Mr. Fetterman if he won. “I will volunteer for him,” she said. “Maybe not as passionately as for Conor Lamb.”
Polls close in North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. ET. Here are some races to watch.
Trump's Power in the Senate
Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd is in an 11-way GOP primary that includes former Rep. Mark Walker and former Gov. Pat McCrory. The race will be part of the ongoing test of the power of former President Trump's endorsement in primary contests. The candidates are vying to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Richard Burr. The nonpartisan Cook Political report rates the seat as leaning Republican.
This is likely to give Mr. Trump’s track record a boost early on in the night. A poll this month by Emerson College showed Mr. Budd <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 43% support</span>, Mr. McCrory <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 16% and</span> Walker <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 12%.</span>
Can Madison Cawthorn Fight off Challengers?
Voters in Western North Carolina will decide whether to follow Mr. Trump's advice and give freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn a second chance or not. The gaffe-plagued congressman is battling to win an eight-way primary that became crowded when he sought to change districts.
Strategists are watching the number of unaffiliated voters that vote in the primary. It could be Democrats from Asheville weighing in on the primary, trying to vote against Mr. Cawthorn for a more establishment-type Republican in the deep-red district. State Sen. Chuck Edwards is the candidate backed by Sen. Thom Tillis and other legislators. Mr. Cawthorn <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needs 30% plus</span> one vote to avoid a runoff in July.
""If there's a runoff, Cawthorn loses,"" Mr. Tillis told reporters on Tuesday.
Another test for Trump in North Carolina's open district
If Mr. Trump's endorsements hold firm, Mr. Cawthorn could be joined by another 26-year-old in Congress. Former college football player Bo Hines is running in a crowded primary and two conservative groups -- the Club for Growth and a super PAC aligned with the House Freedom Caucus – have spent more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $2 million</span> to help him.
He faces seven other candidates. They include attorney Kelly Daughtry, who has put millions of her own money in the race, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers, who may have some name recognition in the area from her time representing part of the district <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 to</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017.</span>
When Summer Lee ran for re-election to the state House two years ago, her county’s Democratic Party committee endorsed her primary election opponent. It was a rare step, given that party organizations tend to favor incumbents, and a sign that Ms. Lee’s progressive views were in conflict with those of local Democratic leaders.
Today, Ms. Lee is running for a U.S. House seat in the Pittsburgh area, facing lawyer Steve Irwin and others in the Democratic primary. Once again, she has become a flag-bearer in the campaign by the Democrats’ liberal wing to overtake the party’s centrists.
The race, to replace retiring Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat, is one of several on Tuesday that will signal whether Democratic voters are willing to take a left turn. Others include House races in Oregon and North Carolina.
Ms. Lee, who local officials say would be the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress, has endorsements from members of the “squad’’ -- the most liberal members of the House -- including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party and other liberal groups have backed her, as well.
Absent from her endorsement list once again is the Allegheny County Democratic Committee.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The party committee is backing Mr. Irwin, who is pushing for such Democratic priorities as <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $15 minimum</span> wage and universal background checks for gun purchases.</span> But on Medicare and climate change, among other issues, his approach is more incremental than that of Ms. Lee, who supports Medicare for all and has opposed some new fracking wells to extract natural gas.
Mr. Doyle is backing Mr. Irwin to be his successor in the House, and other prominent officials, including former Gov. Ed Rendell, are backing Mr. Irwin, as well.",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,
657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,15267,"<h3>Elizabeth Warren: The Federal Reserve Is Trying ‘To Get More People Fired’</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is coming under increasing political pressure to stop raising interest rates as aggressively as it has done so this year.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced another rate hike Wednesday as Democrats worry Powell’s monetary policy will cause a recession.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He’s pushing hard to get more people fired because he thinks that is one way to help bring down inflation,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“But it’s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.
</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Powell has openly admitted that there’s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But the members of the Fed’s board of governors said they think they’ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed’s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year ― still historically high but down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.2% in</span> September.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Powell described the current strength of the labor market as an obstacle to reducing inflation on Wednesday.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Job growth is very high, wages are very high, vacancies are quite elevated and really there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand,” Powell told reporters.</span> “So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Fed can’t do anything about supply problems caused by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, as Powell has repeatedly admitted.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The only thing the Fed can affect through interest rates is aggregate demand in the economy, and it will take an unknown number of months for consumers to feel the impact.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">At a hearing earlier this year, Warren questioned Powell about whether higher interest rates would reduce prices for food or fuel, and he said they would not.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“The chairman of the Fed has admitted to me in a hearing that those rate hikes will not affect the price of groceries, will not bring down the cost of energy, because of the other forces that have driven up prices,” Warren said.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“The moderation in inflation is one more reminder that we need a lot of data about where prices are moving, and we need it over a longer period of time before the Fed hauls off and takes yet again extremist actions to raise interest rates.”</span>",,,,,,,0,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

Millions of workers are doing their day jobs from makeshift set-ups in their living rooms and kitchens, while those in England who can't work from home are now encouraged to go back in if they can do so safely.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">But how exposed to coronavirus might you be in your job?</span> And how does that compare to others?
Data from the UK's Office for National Statistics, based on a US survey, puts into context the risk of exposure to disease, as well as the amount of close human contact workers had before social distancing and other safety measures were introduced.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">See how your job ranks by using the search below.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">While most jobs require people to work relatively closely to others - somewhere in the range between arm's length and a shared office environment - there are very few that typically involve exposure to disease more than once a year.
</span>It's important to note that the data on both exposure to disease at work and how close people are to others is based on interviews that took place with US workers before the pandemic broke out and social distancing recommendations were introduced.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some jobs may find it easier to adjust than others and there may be slightly different working practices and conditions in the US for certain occupations.</span> The results can be expected to be broadly the same in most developed countries.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Almost all the jobs that have a high exposure to both disease and other people are healthcare professions, while those who scored low on both measures include artists, lawyers and those in more typical office jobs like marketing, HR and financial advisers.
</span>Cleaners, prison officers and undertakers are among those who have relatively high exposure to disease without so much close interaction with other people.
But the people who might be most at risk to a new infectious disease like Covid-19, are those who have lots of close contact with people, but aren't used to being exposed to disease.
Bar staff, hairdressers and actors fall into this category, as well as taxi drivers and bricklayers.

Other figures released by the ONS this week showed that deaths in the healthcare sector in the UK are no higher on average than those in the wider community, although social care workers were dying at higher rates. Given that these healthcare occupations are so exposed to both disease and other people, why have there not been more deaths?
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">This could be because workers in these jobs are more likely to be using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves, says Ben Humberstone, deputy director for health analysis at the ONS.</span> They also follow regular hygiene measures like washing hands.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">One of the jobs which had many more coronavirus deaths than the average was taxi drivers.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That's a job which scores highly in terms of closeness to other people, particularly among those jobs which are still actually possible to do at the moment.</span> Bar staff, hairdressers and fitness instructors all score higher, but with bars, gyms and hair salons shut, most of these people will be isolating.
As taxi drivers are less exposed to disease in normal times, there may not be an existing culture of regular hand-washing and wearing PPE. Some firms are trialling partition screens and distributing gloves and masks to protect their drivers and customers.
Methodology
The data in the look-up comes from this release by the ONS.
The figures on proximity to others and exposure to disease come from a survey carried out by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) in which they asked respondents in the US to place themselves on a 1-5 scale for the following two questions.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

</span>2. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">How often does your current job require you to be exposed to diseases or infection?
</span>For exposure to disease, a score of one means they are never exposed, while a score of five means they are exposed daily. It's referring to any disease, not coronavirus specifically.
For the physical closeness question, one means the respondent works more than 100ft away from the nearest other person, while five means they need to touch or be near to touching other people at work. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The survey was carried out before social distancing measures were introduced and workers in certain jobs will of course find it easier to adjust than others.

Updated Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 5</span>:27 pm ET

The pain in the oil patch is bleeding over from energy companies to some of the largest U.S. banks.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Wells Fargo <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">WFC 0.23</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle & Co. said Wednesday as part of its third-quarter earnings that deterioration in the bank’s portfolio of loans to oil-and-gas producers eliminated a once-reliable benefit to the San Francisco-based lender’s results.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The bank continued bracing for potential losses on those loans as its quarterly earnings narrowly beat expectations.</span> Wells Fargo reported a profit <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.8 billion</span>, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% increase</span> from the same period <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Revenue also beat analysts’ expectations, rising <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $21.88 billion</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $21.21 billion</span>.</span> Analysts had <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected $21.76 billion</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Weakness in energy credits driven by the recent fall in oil prices is compounding a difficult environment for banks in which low interest rates have pressured lending profitability.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We believe the energy-services sector will incur greater challenges,” said Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry on a call with analysts.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Over time, we would expect some correlated stress in communities that are dependent on oil and gas.”

Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, is giving special attention to loans in metropolitan areas where more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% of</span> jobs are directly tied to energy production, Mr. Shrewsberry said.

</span>The bank’s shares fell <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 0.7% on</span> the day.

Despite the improved performance of the bank’s holdings of residential mortgages, a worsening of loans to energy companies prompted the bank to hold steady the amount that it had previously set aside to cover losses. The bank <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">released $300 million</span> from those funds in the third quarter a year ago. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">That amount would have increased the firm’s income before taxes by more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% in</span> the third quarter.

</span>Releasing loan-loss reserves has consistently helped boost Wells Fargo’s bottom line in recent years. The third quarter was the first time since <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2010 that</span> it didn’t get a lift from a release. Banks typically release reserves when they view credit quality on their loans improving. Loan charge-offs in the bank’s commercial-and-industrial-loan portfolio, which includes energy exposure, roughly doubled <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $122 million</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $67 million</span> a year earlier.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">James Abate, chief investment officer of New York-based Centre Asset Management LLC, said he is concerned the financial industry is underestimating the woes in the energy sector given potential “spillover effects.”

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In addition to those concerns, Mr. Abate said his firm, which owns <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 155,000 shares</span> of Wells Fargo, plans to continue reducing its financial-stock exposure due to low rates and a flattening yield curve.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He also wasn’t impressed with Wells Fargo’s quarterly return on equity, return on assets and net-interest margins, three closely watched profitability metrics that all declined for the bank in the third quarter.

</span>“The results were unequivocally bad in terms of performance,” he said.

Wells Fargo executives said Wednesday that the bank’s profitability is still better than peers. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The firm reported its net interest margin, a measure of how profitably it can lend out its customers’ deposits, fell <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.96% from</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.97% at</span> the end of June <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 3.06% in</span> the third quarter a year ago.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">That margin has been challenged by the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates low, a policy that Wells Fargo executives said would continue for longer than the industry had previously expected.

</span>In light of that forecast, the bank said it would continue repositioning some of its balance sheet. Wells Fargo invested in more longer-dated bonds and noted that some of the assets in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $32 billion</span> commercial-lending-and-leasing businesses it recently said it would purchase from General Electric Co. had the extra benefit of paying off while rates were low.

Wells Fargo’s overall loan activity picked up during the quarter, despite the concerns in oil and gas. Total loans at the end of the quarter <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were $903.23 billion</span>, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7.7% increase</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $838.88 billion</span> in the same period a year ago.

Mr. Shrewsberry said in an interview that the act of reducing credit to indebted energy companies is “part of the healing mechanism” as they repair balance sheets. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He added that he thinks this period would be different than other cycles when energy prices slumped because most bank loans are now secured by energy reserves.</span> Additionally, banks will be repaid in front of other unsecured bondholders.

Some of Wells Fargo’s clients in the energy sector have disclosed lately that their lenders have reduced their borrowing limits and tightened their grip on collateral. Emerald Oil Inc., which produces oil in North Dakota and Montana, said late Monday that Wells Fargo and other lenders reduced credit available to the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 40% to</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $120 million</span>. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That was less than the amount that Emerald had already borrowed, forcing the company to look for alternative financing to cover the difference.

</span>Chesapeake Energy Corp. said late last month that its lenders, including Wells Fargo, tied <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $4 billion</span> credit facility to its untapped oil and gas reserves after years being able to borrow the same amount on an unsecured basis. Representatives of the firms couldn’t be reached for immediate comment Wednesday.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,63507,"<h3>As China Talks Begin, Trump’s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering</h3>WASHINGTON — <span id=""0"" class=""red"">In the middle of his crowded dinner in Buenos Aires with President Xi Jinping of China, President Trump leaned across the table, pointed to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative whose skepticism of China runs deep, and declared, “That’s my negotiator!”
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">He then turned to Peter Navarro, his even more hawkish trade adviser, adding, “And that’s my tough guy!”</span> according to aides with knowledge of the exchange.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Now, with talks between China and the United States set to begin this week in Beijing, Mr. Lighthizer, aided by Mr. Navarro, faces the assignment of a lifetime: redefining the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies by Mr. Trump’s <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2 deadline</span> to reach an agreement.
</span>And he must do it in a way that tilts the balance of power toward the United States. His approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">First, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Despite his declaration that trade wars are “easy to win” and his recent boast that he is a “Tariff Man,” Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.
</span>Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his advisers that Mr. Xi is someone with whom he can cut a big deal, according to people who have spoken with the president. On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi to discuss the status of talks, tweeting afterward that good progress was being made. “Deal is moving along very well,” Mr. Trump said.
The administration has tried to force China to change its ways with stiff tariffs <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $250 billion</span> worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and threats of additional levies on <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $267 billion</span> worth of goods. China has responded with its own tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods. But over a steak dinner during the Group <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 summit</span> meeting in Argentina, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump agreed to a 90-day truce and to work toward an agreement that Mr. Trump said could lead to “one of the largest deals ever made.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“It’s not some subtle shift; Trump has flipped since September,” said Derek Scissors, who studies China’s economy for the American Enterprise Institute.</span> “He went from saying how he was going to slap tariffs on everything to all this talk about making the greatest deal ever.”
Mr. Lighthizer — whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February — has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting “empty promises” like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Lighthizer,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 71,</span> is pushing for substantive changes, such as forcing China to end its practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.</span> But <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 40 years</span> of dealing with China and watching it dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs in order to win true concessions.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">When Mr. Lighthizer senses that anyone — even Mr. Trump — might be going a little soft on China, he opens a paper-clipped manila folder he totes around and brandishes a single-page, easy-reading chart that lists decades of failed trade negotiations with Beijing, according to administration officials.
</span>“Bob’s attitude toward China is very simple. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He wants them to surrender,” said William A. Reinsch, a former federal trade official who met him three decades ago when Mr. Lighthizer was a young aide for former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.</span> “His negotiating strategy is simple too. He basically gives them a list of things he wants them to do and says, ‘Fix it now.’”
Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Lighthizer last month to lead the talks initially spooked markets, which viewed the China skeptic’s appointment as an ominous sign. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It also annoyed Chinese officials, who had been talking with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a more moderate voice on trade and the primary point of contact for Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Mnuchin has urged the president to avoid a protracted trade war, even if that entails reaching an interim agreement that leaves some issues unresolved.
</span>Mr. Mnuchin, who attended the G-20 dinner, helped Mr. Trump craft an upbeat assessment declaring the Buenos Aires meeting “highly successful” in the presidential limousine back to the airport, according to a senior administration official.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The disparate views among Mr. Trump’s top trade advisers have prompted sparring — both publicly and behind the scenes.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">In <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2017,</span> when Mr. Lighthizer grew concerned that Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, were wading too far into China matters, he enlisted Rob Porter, the president’s staff secretary at the time, to persuade Mr. Trump to draft a document designating Mr. Lighthizer the main trade emissary to China, according to a person who has seen the letter.</span> Mr. Lighthizer has never used the document to defend his position, the person said, but he considers it an insurance policy of sorts.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">During an Oval Office meeting with the trade team the fall <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017,</span> Mr. Lighthizer accused Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the former National Economic Council director, of bad-mouthing him to free-trade Republican senators.
</span>The argument grew so heated that the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, quickly pulled the combatants into the nearby Roosevelt Room and away from the president, where the argument raged on for a few more minutes, according to two witnesses.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, disputed the account.
</span>Mr. Lighthizer has since worked to increase his own face time with Mr. Trump. He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president’s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer’s <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own $2.3 million</span> waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.
He used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China’s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing’s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.
“Good luck with that,” Mr. Scissors said.
Those who know Mr. Lighthizer say he will try to force concessions through a combination of pressure tactics, like tariffs, and public condemnation. Mr. Lighthizer — who described his own negotiating style as “knowing where the leverage is” during <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1984 interview</span> — typically presents few specific demands during initial talks while publicly bashing efforts by the other side.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He used that approach during recent talks with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, criticizing foreign counterparts as intransigent and characterizing complaints by American businesses as pure greed.
</span>Mr. Lighthizer’s unsparing view of China comes, in part, from his childhood in Ashtabula, Ohio, an industrial and shipping town on the Great Lakes hit by the offshoring of steel and chemical production. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">For much of his career, Mr. Lighthizer was a lonely protectionist voice in a Republican Party dominated by free traders, alternating between jobs in government and a lucrative private law career representing large American corporations like United States Steel in trade cases against China.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Mr. Lighthizer found his way into Mr. Trump’s orbit through his work in the steel industry, where he gained prominence by filing lawsuits accusing Japan and China of dumping metals into the United States, in violation of trade laws.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> Mr. Lighthizer caught Mr. Trump’s eye with an opinion piece in The Washington Times, in which he defended Mr. Trump’s approach to China as consistent with conservative ideology and compared the future president to Republican icons like Ronald Reagan.
Taciturn in public and self-deprecating in private, Mr. Lighthizer sees himself as a serious player on the world stage: Two recent guests to Mr. Lighthizer’s Georgetown townhouse were greeted by the stern visage of their host staring down at them from an oil portrait on the wall.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">The trade adviser is guarded around Mr. Trump, often waiting until the end of meetings to make his points and quietly nudging the president away from actions he views as counterproductive, current and former officials said.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">That was the case in mid-2017 when he cautioned the president against withdrawing unilaterally from the World Trade Organization, adding for emphasis, “And I hate the W.T.O. as much as anybody.”
</span>He does not always get his way. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">In the wake of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this fall, Mr. Lighthizer urged Mr. Trump to consider easing steel and aluminum tariffs on those countries and replacing them with less burdensome quotas.</span> Mr. Trump rejected his plan, according to negotiators from all three countries.
A poker-faced Mr. Lighthizer broke the news to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts by declaring the proposal was inoperative, one of the officials said.
The president also ignored Mr. Lighthizer’s advice in early December when he announced that he intended to begin the six-month process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta in order to pressure House Democrats into passing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">That threat undermined months of quiet negotiations between Mr. Lighthizer, labor groups and Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to try to win their support for the new trade deal.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump has yet to follow through on his threat, and Mr. Lighthizer continues trying to work with Democrats to get the new trade deal approved.
</span>“Bob is trying to provide stability and focus in a completely chaotic environment,” Mr. Brown said. “I can’t speak for Bob, but I am certain he is frustrated. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">How could you not be frustrated as the U.S. trade representative for a president who knows what his gut thinks but hasn’t put much of his brains into trade?”</span>",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He got one Thursday — or at least a faithful understudy — in the person of Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence met Mr. Johnson <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 Downing</span> Street to pass along President Trump’s support of the prime minister’s plan to pull Britain out of the European Union.
Mr. Trump himself offered Mr. Johnson a long-distance pat on the back Wednesday as Mr. Johnson battled a recalcitrant Parliament, telling reporters, “Boris knows how to win.”
These days, however, Mr. Johnson does not look like much of a winner. He suffered back-to-back defeats in Parliament on his call for an election and his vow to withdraw from the European Union, with or without a deal, by Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.</span> <span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Thursday, his own brother, Jo Johnson, resigned from Parliament and the government, saying he was “torn between family loyalty and the national interest.”
</span>Friendship with Mr. Trump is also a fickle thing. He was friendly with President Emmanuel Macron of France until the two men fell out over Iran and climate change, among other issues. Mr. Johnson, as foreign secretary under Prime Minister Theresa May, unsuccessfully lobbied the White House not to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Mr. Trump dangled again, via Mr. Pence, the prospect of a profitable trade agreement with the United States.
</span>“He told me this morning,” Mr. Pence said. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He said, ‘You tell my friend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that we’re ready to go to work on that free trade agreement just as soon as you’re ready.’”
Mr. Johnson appeared gratified — “fantastic,” he interjected at one point — but also wary of a bearhug from a leader who remains deeply unpopular in Britain.</span> The meeting, which could have been an anodyne display of support, instead captured the complexities of Mr. Johnson’s “bromance” with Mr. Trump.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While Mr. Johnson welcomed Mr. Pence’s promise of trade talks, he said, “You guys are pretty tough negotiators, so we are going to work very hard to make sure that the free trade deal is one that works for all sides.”
</span>Critics of Mr. Johnson say that a post-Brexit Britain, particularly if it leaves without a deal, would be so heavily dependent on the United States that Mr. Trump would be able extract punitive terms in any negotiation.
Under Mr. Johnson, these people say, Britain’s prized public health system would be pried open by American insurance and pharmaceutical companies, while the United States would force British shoppers to buy chlorine-washed poultry that falls below European standards.
“We’re not too keen on that chlorinated chicken,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own here on the opposition bench.”
His reference was to Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, whom Mr. Johnson referred to as a “chlorinated chicken” during a debate in Parliament on Wednesday after he challenged Mr. Corbyn to back a snap election.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">During Mr. Trump’s visit in June, he first signaled that everything would be on the table in a trade negotiation.</span> But he later walked back his words under intense pressure from his British hosts, excluding the health care system.
On Thursday, Mr. Johnson took pains to reiterate that “the National Health Service is not on the table.” <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He also reminded Mr. Pence of American trade barriers against British agriculture and other exports.
</span>“The people of the United States of America don’t eat any British lamb or beef — or haggis from Scotland,” the prime minister said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“There are still barriers to trade in shower trays, if you can believe it, from the U.K.”
</span>For Mr. Johnson, the politics of his relationship with Mr. Trump have always been tricky. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Johnson has played up his ties to reassure voters that if Britain leaves the European Union, he would be well-placed to hammer out a trade agreement with his friend in the White House.
</span>For his part, Mr. Trump has been steadfast in his support of Mr. Johnson’s aggressive approach to the Brexit negotiations, including his threat to leave without a deal. Mr. Pence has echoed that position.
If Mr. Johnson finds himself, in a few weeks, locked in an election against a Labour Party eager to paint him as a lackey of Washington, analysts say he may have to distance himself from what Mr. Pence celebrated as “the very warm and personal relationship you have forged with President Trump.”
Until now, Mr. Johnson has taken a studiously respectful tone with the president. It is hard to imagine him joking with Mr. Trump about “chlorinated chicken” the way he did with Mr. Pence. In their meeting on Thursday, Mr. Pence stuck to a script, as he usually does, while Mr. Johnson joked, interrupted his guest and spoke casually — playing a role almost like that of Mr. Trump.",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world
Bank reserves are normally obscure, even to bankers and professional investors.</span> But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs—known as the overnight repo rate—to spike. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a worry, because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> but it shot up almost as high <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% on</span> Tuesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market.</span> That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">To settle markets down, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has dipped into this market, conducting three auctions this week where banks could swap Treasurys (or bonds from institutions like Fannie Mae ) for new reserves.</span> It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $75 billion</span> in repos.
Here’s is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they’ve come to matter.
What are reserves?
Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.
Central bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called “reserves.” The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.
There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.
What are reserves for?
The main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.
But that’s not what really happens. In fact, the first person’s bank reduces the amount in the person’s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person’s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don’t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.
</span>Where do reserves come from?
One way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Whether it wants to pay government workers’ wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government’s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.
Where does QE come in?
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of QE—quantitative easing—was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.
</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.
</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer’s bank account disappears.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.
</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?
This is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn’t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.
Newsletter Sign-up
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">If banks don’t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn’t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn’t yet been identified.

More will follow.</h3>Crucial to President Trump’s political mystique is maintaining the illusion that he is perpetually winning, basking in adoring crowds, in total control of events and dominating his foes on every front — no matter how dramatically he must falsify reality to keep that impression alive.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">And so, even though Trump’s tariff wars are growing so unhinged and unpopular that members of his own party are rebelling against them, the president’s political team is leaking word that he’s going on offense bigly on trade, against his No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 perceived</span> enemy of the moment: the Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.
</span>But now, I’m told, Biden is gearing up to take Trump on over the issue, opening up a new front in an area that is central to Trump’s reelection hopes, and one that some Democrats have shied away from.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a statement sent to this blog, the Biden campaign sharpened its criticism of Trump on trade, hammering his agenda as “erratic and impulsive,” while claiming it’s imposing untold “economic pain” on ordinary Americans via a “Trump Tax” and diminishing our country’s standing in the world.
</span>According to new reporting by Axios, the Trump campaign privately sees Biden as a threat to him in the industrial Midwest, which will be pivotal to reelection, because “internal Trump polls have Biden substantially ahead in the Rust Belt.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the plan, Axios reports, is for Trump allies to begin hammering Biden as a “free-trading globalist who would undo the president’s trade agenda.”</span> They will do this by raising questions, such as: “What specifically will Biden do with China? Will he lift President Trump’s tariffs? How does Biden defend his past advocacy for NAFTA?”
The Biden campaign is hitting back. In a statement sent my way, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said this:
We can’t trust President Trump to look out for American workers, because for all his bluster, he never does. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Just look at the record: The trade deficit is larger than when Trump took office, he’s forced labor to take a back seat in his dealings with China, and he’s alienated our allies who also suffer from China’s trade abuses.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Instead of delivering results, Trump is asking American farmers and American families to bear all the costs of his trade war.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">His administration’s erratic and impulsive approach to China is causing families economic pain.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Joe Biden would rally our friends and allies to hold China accountable, so that working families and farmers don’t pay an extra Trump Tax.</span> Biden would also restore our standing in the world on <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Day 1,</span> advance our security and prosperity, and deliver results for all Americans -- not just the well connected.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">What’s noteworthy here is the effort to tie Trump’s trade failures to a broader failure of Trumpian nationalism.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The New York Times reports that the Trump campaign believes his continued trade war with China could be a political plus, letting Trump “cater to his political base” while “heading off any Democratic attempts to outflank him as the great protector of American workers.”
</span>But there’s no reason to presume in advance that Trump has the upper hand on this issue. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Unlike <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> voters have now seen the concrete results of Trump’s nationalist trade bluster — and the genuinely held worldview underpinning it — colliding with the complex realities of international diplomacy and the global economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">That collision has rendered Trump vulnerable on trade — even in the Rust Belt.</span> A new Detroit News poll of Michigan finds that Trump trails most Democratic hopefuls, some by large margins. Notably,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47 percent</span> of Michigan voters say Trump’s China policies are bad for the state, vs. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 26 percent</span> who say the opposite.
Crucially, among Michigan union households, opposition climbs <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 55 percent</span>, and independents oppose the policies <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2 to</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> Those groups likely include many of the blue-collar white and Obama-Trump voters Democrats must win back. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, recent Quinnipiac polling found that in the industrial Midwest states, Trump’s trade policies are underwater.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">What’s more, Democrats have a good argument to make against Trump on trade: that his nationalism in practice has proved reckless, rooted in rage and whim; alienating to allies; and counterproductive, and that Democrats would restore sober, reality-based international cooperation to the center of our trade agenda.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Such an approach might be employed, say, against China’s currency manipulation practices, as progressive economist Dean Baker points out.</span> “A multilateral approach would likely mean getting the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States to negotiate a rise in the Chinese yuan of some targeted amount against the dollar,” Baker told me.
By blasting Trump’s agenda as “erratic and impulsive” and by vowing to rally allies against China and to “restore our standing in the world,” the Biden campaign is beginning to road-test such an argument.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Biden takes hits from the left on trade
All this comes as Biden might himself be vulnerable on the issue.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Progressives such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have staked out aggressive positions against trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, both of which Biden supported.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Sanders recently ripped Biden for expressing skepticism that China is going to “eat our lunch,” arguing that Biden downplayed the Chinese threat to U.S. workers and vowing himself to offer a trade agenda that is in their interests.
</span>A Biden campaign source tells me that Biden offered this in the spirit of trying to disarm Trump’s demagoguery of the China threat, which is the groundwork for a case for a more rational, multilateral approach in place of threats and bluster.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Biden has knocked Trump’s trade war with China, and we should expect a more comprehensive substantive blueprint from him in coming months.
</span>The differences between the primary candidates on China will be litigated in the primaries, of course. And so will Biden’s position on NAFTA, which he has since defended, though some polls suggest it might not matter a great deal to Democratic voters.
But this debate is all to the good. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Whoever the Democratic nominee is, he or she may unite the party around an agenda built on multilateral cooperation against China, higher wage, labor and environmental standards in trade deals, and serious investments in displaced U.S. workers.</span> Such a debate will ultimately put Democrats in a stronger position against Trump in an area where he’s weaker than all the bluster suggests.

657b836bb82c37cf3d68df6d,64400,"<h3>Opinion | Why the age of inequality has made us less happy</h3>As it turns out, people who trumpet that research ignore a major finding in it: People do express more satisfaction with their overall lives the more money they have on hand. They also ignore a more recent survey of millionaires, which found those <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $8 million</span> banked were happier than those with less than that amount.
A fascinating study released last month offers us another angle to consider in the money and happiness conundrum: It’s quite possible that the age of inequality has come for our happiness.
In a paper released last month by the journal Emotion, researchers Jean Twenge and A. Bell Cooper studied responses to questions about happiness from the General Social Survey. Looking at decades of people’s answers to questions such as whether someone was “very happy,” they found that “money and prestige do appear to buy happiness, and more is continuously better.” But there is a kicker: This was not a stable finding.
In the 1970s, people with different amounts of money experienced similar levels of happiness. But over time a gap developed, one that turned into something of a chasm. When Twenge spoke to The Post earlier this month, she speculated that inequality is a major reason.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Income inequality was not much of an issue in the early to mid-1970s, when the <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 1 percent</span> of households earned less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> of total income in the United States.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But the income gap between <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1 percent</span> and the rest is now at the highest level <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 50 years</span>, driven by everything from the decline of union representation among workers — unions not only bargain for better pay, but also for workplace protections — to the offshoring of jobs to increasing CEO pay.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The necessities of life didn’t come down in price to make up for the difference.</span> Instead, they went up. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Adjusted for inflation, the cost of attending college — either public or private — more than doubled.</span> The same is true for buying a home. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The price of health care soared so high that the typical employer-provided family plan now costs more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $20,000,</span> and comes with a four-figure deductible.</span> (The typical family only pays <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $6,000 of</span> it, but you can think of that <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">other $14,000 as</span> something you might otherwise see in your paycheck, if you are lucky enough to still have one.) <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And as two-earner families became the norm, there was a new, backbreaking expense that needed to be accounted for: child care, something that has risen in price such that in a majority of states, it costs more than attending public college.
</span>What we call a “good life” got harder and harder for many to afford, leaving many to borrow more and more money — mortgages, student loans, credit cards, you name it. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But it should surprise no one to discover that struggling with debt is correlated with greater levels of depression.</span> One study, published in Social Science & Medicine <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> found those with student loans are more likely to experience “poorer psychological functioning.”
It’s not just that, as research shows, using money to buy our way out of tasks we find unpleasant — like housekeeping or cooking — increases our happiness level. It’s also that money buys privilege — the privilege of health (yes, the wealthy are healthier, and, yes, good health increases happiness), or, say, the privilege of working from home during a pandemic.
In the United States, we buy books on happiness, and we download apps that claim they will improve our mood. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Yet all too many of us live in denial of the impacts of income and wealth inequality.</span> When asked, we routinely overestimate the middle and lower classes’ share of the money pie, and we are more likely than those in countries with less inequality to tell pollsters that working hard is key to getting ahead in life.
In a society that is all but obsessed with the idea of happiness, I suspect it’s simply too painful to admit that our chances of achieving it are greater when our literal fortunes are greater, too.

Stresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn’t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“That time is now upon us,” Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell didn’t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Reserves dropped to less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates—and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2008 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.

</span>“This is not QE,” Mr. Powell said. “In no sense is this QE.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed’s plan hasn’t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials’</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.

</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government’s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation

WASHINGTON—The government accuses the company’s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film “Casablanca.” The company likens the government’s case to a shaved Persian cat, “pale and thin.”
A federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.
It could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as
Alphabet Inc.’s
Google and
Facebook Inc.
Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.
</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren’t head-to-head competitors. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They want to combine AT&T’s video-distribution network with Time Warner’s content—from HBO’s “Game of Thrones” to the NCAA basketball tournament—in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.
</span>“This will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,” said Wayne State University law professor
Stephen Calkins,
“and what the court says will be terribly important.”

The case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss
Randall Stephenson
and U.S. antitrust chief
Makan Delrahim.
Mr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.
Mr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal—the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,
Amazon.com Inc.,
Hulu and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube. Younger customers increasingly watch video on phones, tablets and laptops.
The upheaval has left the pay-TV industry scrambling. Mr. Stephenson made <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $49 billion</span> play for video distribution by acquiring DirecTV, the top U.S. pay-TV satellite service, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> He’s now trying to make the company’s wireless and video bundles more attractive to viewers and investors by adding Time Warner news, sports and entertainment assets to the package.
Given Mr. Delrahim’s objections, the deal has been pending <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 17 months</span>, creating something of an industry chessboard frozen in time, with competitors uncertain of their next play. Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.’s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with
Walt Disney Co.
instead. (Journal parent company News Corp and
21st Century Fox
share common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as
Comcast
and
Verizon Communications Inc.
and clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.

Question of competition
The case raises this central question: If AT&T buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.
Mr. Delrahim’s team says yes. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and “American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.”
</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren’t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner’s content, especially the Turner networks—including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV—are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner’s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.

On the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn’t be so willing under AT&T. “With the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,” it says in filings.
AT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast’s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of “behavioral” conditions.
AT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone’s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. “AT&T and Time Warner aren’t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,” the companies say.
AT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn’t remedy the merger’s harms to competition.
Where Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T’s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers’ interests and preferences.

</span>Bad blood
High-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.
Mr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim’s motives and cited a television interview <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn’t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.
The two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President
Donald Trump,
as a carrot to win Justice Department approval.
Mr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.
The Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson’s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film “Casablanca,” quoting his famous line, “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”
People close to AT&T’s management say the department’s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable statements.
AT&T, in its own brief, said the department’s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: “Now, what remains of the government’s case, ‘like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,’ ” borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 case</span>.
That choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 19.</span> This isn’t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger’s fate.
The Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.
AT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO
Jeff Bewkes,
about what they see as the deal’s benefits.

There is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump’s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the “elephant in the room” when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.
Mr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn’t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump’s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T’s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn’t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.
Judge Leon’s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.
The AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company—and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $4 billion</span>.
</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department’s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump’s comments about the deal.
The Justice Department has been riding a decade’s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.
Mr. Delrahim’s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 28,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 2</span>:40 pm ET

GlaxoSmithKline PLC <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">GSK 0.20</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle is pinning the future of its HIV business on an audacious bet: upending the decades-old treatment strategy that has turned a fatal illness into a chronic condition.

</span>The treatment of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has changed little since the mid-1990s, when the introduction of a new class of drug dramatically improved HIV therapy. Doctors found that combining the newer type of antiretroviral drug with two drugs from an earlier class hindered the virus from developing resistance.

A three-drug regimen has remained the standard approach since then, with drug development efforts focused on making ever more powerful triple combinations.

Glaxo executives want to change that. They hope the U.K.-based drug company’s latest HIV pill is powerful enough to suppress the virus with the help of just one other drug. That, according to Chief Executive Andrew Witty, would be a “game-changer,” because taking fewer drugs would produce fewer side effects.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now, Glaxo’s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare, in which Pfizer Inc. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">PFE 2.30</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle of the U.S. and <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Shionogi 4507 </span>-1.46%decrease; red down pointing triangle & Co. of Japan hold minority stakes, is getting down to the long process of proving it.

</span>The drug in question, dolutegravir, is one of a class of HIV drugs known as integrase inhibitors that rapidly reduce the level of virus in the blood. It is already approved for use as part of traditional triple therapy and so far, there are no reported cases of the virus developing resistance to dolutegravir in patients who are new to treatment. That makes it unique among integrase inhibitors, according to David Hardy, an HIV doctor and a spokesman for the HIV Medicines Association, an advocacy group.

While dolutegravir’s profile suggests it could potentially suppress HIV without the help of any other drug, Glaxo is taking a precautionary stepwise approach to investigating its promise, said a company spokeswoman.

The most important benefit of a two-drug regimen is that it would come with fewer side effects. Such effects, including nausea, diarrhea, kidney problems and bone-thinning, are one of the most common reasons for patients to change an HIV regimen. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It could also lighten the financial burden of HIV.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rochelle Walensky, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, estimated that switching just a quarter of patients currently on triple therapy to dolutegravir plus 3TC—an older, generic HIV drug—would knock more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3 billion</span> off the cost of treating HIV over a five-year period.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The cost saving is less clear if both drugs in the regimen are still under patent protection.

</span>Glaxo is putting “tremendous focus and priority” on the development of two-drug regimens, Mr. Witty said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">According to analysis by UBS, the opportunity is significant: If dual therapy becomes the strategy that doctors prefer, Glaxo could grab a much bigger slice of the market and overtake Gilead Sciences Inc. to become the biggest player in HIV treatment within three years.

</span>Over the past year, Glaxo has started several large clinical trials that aim to show that combining dolutegravir with just one other HIV medicine works as well as traditional triple therapy at suppressing the virus.

In one set of trials, it is testing dolutegravir alongside rilpivirine, a brand-name HIV drug made by Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals. In another, it is combining dolutegravir with 3TC, the generic drug used in Dr. Walensky’s analysis.

It also plans to start a late-stage trial combining an injectable version of dolutegravir with rilpivirine. An earlier trial showed this combination was as effective as a three-drug regimen when the virus had already been suppressed by an initial period of triple therapy.

The trials won’t start yielding results until next year, but a small study led by Pedro Cahn, a doctor in Argentina, offers some reason for optimism. In that 48-week trial, dolutegravir plus 3TC suppressed HIV levels <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 18 out</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 previously</span> untreated patients.

Even if Glaxo’s large clinical trials succeed, it could face another challenge: inertia.

In the past year, Gilead has launched a series of triple therapies using a new HIV drug called TAF that can be administered at a much lower dose than its predecessor, causing less harm to the kidneys.

Christoph Wyen, an HIV specialist at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, said the advent of these less-toxic triple therapies reduces the incentive for doctors to switch patients to simpler regimens. He said dual therapy might take off more quickly in older patients, who are more likely to have age-related health complications.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Gilead and Glaxo both have strong positions in the HIV market with TAF- and dolutegravir-based triple regimens, respectively.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But Gilead is developing a new integrase inhibitor that, if proven equal to dolutegravir, could give it an important advantage in the triple-therapy market.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The worst-case scenario for Glaxo would be for its dual therapies to fail and for Gilead’s integrase inhibitor—which, if successful, is expected to launch in 2018—to steal market share from dolutegravir.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That could send Glaxo’s HIV business into decline <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2018,</span> according to UBS, though Mr. Witty says that the downside is limited because dolutegravir will be well-established by the time Gilead’s competitor comes along.

</span>“It’s not a foregone conclusion that [dual therapy] is going to work,” said Dr. Hardy. But “I’ve watched the development of dolutegravir enough to understand why they are trying to do this.”

The official death toll doesn’t tell the story, the British organization Oxfam says. The C.D.C. director overruled her own advisers and recommended Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for health care workers and others at risk.
War-torn Yemen, where the overwhelming majority of the population is unvaccinated, is seeing coronavirus cases multiply and deaths soar, according to a report this week by the British charity Oxfam.
Oxfam found that Covid deaths had increased by more than fivefold in the past month and that recorded Covid cases had tripled. The charity said actual figures were likely to be much higher, with many unregistered cases and deaths.
The official Covid death toll <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,658,</span> and recorded cases have <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 8,789.</span> But the situation in the country of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 million</span> is hard to gauge. “Countless” others have died in their homes or have not been diagnosed because of scarce tests and hospital beds, Oxfam said.
Yemen is still embroiled in a war that began <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 when</span> Iran-backed rebels know as the Houthis seized the country’s northwest, including the capital, Sana, sending the government into exile. The government has effectively collapsed, and tens of thousands have died.
The country already faced many health challenges before the coronavirus emerged. Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.
The pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.
“Covid has made life even worse for people across the country,” Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam’s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.
Some relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.
The country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.
</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.
In shelters that host <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.
“The country is not able to cope with another health crisis,” Mr. Mohammed said.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received. The health care system is dangerously underfunded, working with <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 11 percent</span> of what it needs, the organization says.
Some had hoped that the pandemic would force Yemen’s warring parties into a truce, but the war continues.
“If anything, it is amazing how little the pandemic has affected the fighting,” said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst on Yemen for the International Crisis Group, in an interview.
The terror and uncertainty of the war, which has forced people to deal with loss on a daily basis for years, remains a larger concern for many Yemenis than the pandemic itself. “This speaks to the trauma of the conflict,” Mr. Salisbury said.

Alaska, once a leader in vaccinating its citizens, is now in the throes of its worst coronavirus surge of the pandemic, as the Delta variant rips through the state, swamping hospitals with patients.
As of Thursday, the state was <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaging 125 new</span> cases a day for <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 100,000 people</span>, more than any other in the nation, according to recent data trends collected by The New York Times. That figure has shot up <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.
On Wednesday, the state said it had activated “crisis standards of care,” giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.
“We have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,” Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.
Jared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge “crippling” in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.
There is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.
“We are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,” Mr. Kosin said.
Critically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
“Unlike in the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lower 48,</span> you don’t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,” said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.
Mr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. “That is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,” he said.
Alaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.
Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.
“We’re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,” Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.
On the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.
The state’s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country’s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.

The C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency’s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.
The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration’s endorsements over her own agency’s advisers.
The C.D.C.’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.’s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.
Dr. Walensky’s decision was a boost for President Biden’s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.
The C.D.C.’s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.
“I am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.
But the vote on boosters for occupational risk “was close,” Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky’s decision.
“This addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,” Dr. Maldonado added.
Minutes before Dr. Walensky’s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director’s decision.
“Dr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,” Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. “I am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.”
Dr. Walensky’s decision to go against her own agency’s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director’s endorsement of the advisory committee’s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.
But experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.’s decision. “There’s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement” on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would “best serve the nation’s public health needs.”
</span>SEOUL — South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.
At a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family. The government is encouraging people to get tested following the holiday.
Chuseok is roughly equivalent to American Thanksgiving and was observed from Monday through Wednesday. The Korea Transport Institute estimated that <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 32 million</span> people would travel over the holiday.
Over the past week the nation was averaging <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,500 new</span> cases a day, according to statistics collected by Our World in Data. Most cases are concentrated in the capital, Seoul, and surrounding areas, but officials were concerned that the holiday would spread the virus more widely.
Testing and quarantining were the main tools South Korea used to curb the spread of the disease, and the country was able to keep outbreaks at bay in the early part of the pandemic.
South Korea’s vaccination program got off to a slow start, but the country has now <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vaccinated 43 percent</span> of its population. It hopes to <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 70 percent</span> of its population inoculated by October.
“There is no problem at all with the amount of vaccines secured for this year,” President Moon Jae-in said on Friday, according to Reuters. “The vaccine shipment got off to a slower start than other countries, which delayed the vaccination program, but I believe by next month, we will catch up and be a leading country by inoculation rate.”
A few weeks ago the government relaxed several restrictions on in-person meetings. For Chuseok, family gatherings of up to eight people were permitted if at least four people were fully vaccinated.

Hospitals near a grocery store shooting in Collierville, Tenn., were already struggling to keep up with Covid-19 patients when those injured in the attack arrived in emergency rooms on Thursday.
National Guard troops had been stationed at medical centers to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients, and emergency medical providers had recently issued a dire warning to local officials about the strain on hospitals.
“Currently our system emergency departments are operating dangerously over capacity,” the medical providers wrote on Aug.<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span> They added, “We may be unable to provide timely care to everyone and will have to make choices about delivering care to patients based on their probability of survival.”
They expressed particular concern about what could happen in the event of a disaster, given that “the city has no surge capacity to accommodate any additional disaster or unplanned events.”
An average <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 96 percent</span> of I.C.U. beds were occupied in Shelby County, Tenn., on Thursday, according to New York Times data. One nearby facility, St. Francis Hospital, reported that its I.C.U. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 100 percent</span> full; another said its I.C.U. <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 97 percent</span> full. There <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 15 I</span>.C.U. beds available in the five counties in and around Memphis as <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 p</span>.m. Wednesday, according to the Shelby County Health Department.
Officials said at least a dozen people were hurt and one killed inside the Kroger store in Collierville, <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 miles</span> east of Memphis in Shelby County.
Regional One Health, a hospital in Memphis, had received nine patients injured in the shooting, according to a spokeswoman. She said the hospital had the capacity to accommodate those patients. Baptist Memorial Hospital in Collierville received one patient, who was discharged, and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis received two, according to a spokeswoman.
Shelby County reported its highest number of Covid-19 cases during the pandemic last month. Those numbers have decreased slightly in recent weeks but remain high, with a seven-day average <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 409 cases</span>.
<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 44 percent</span> of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated. Governor Bill Lee recently signed an executive order overruling attempts by local officials to require masks in schools. A federal judge blocked the governor’s order from taking effect in Shelby County on Friday after opponents fought it in court.

SYDNEY, Australia — In the war against the coronavirus’s Delta variant, few if any democracies have demanded as much of their people as Australia.
In the middle of the latest lockdowns, the police in Sydney gave hefty fines to three mothers with strollers chatting in a park. Melbourne’s playgrounds were wrapped in police tape, and traveling from a state with Covid restrictions to one without — for the lucky few granted permission by the authorities — requires two-week stints in quarantine at a hotel or a remote former mining camp.
There are now two Australias. In Perth, offices, pubs and stadiums are crammed and normal as ever — the payoff for a closed-border approach that has made Western Australia an island within an island. In Sydney, residents are approaching their 14th week of lockdown. The working-class areas with the highest infection rates have faced a heavy police presence, and, until recently, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 9 p</span>.m. curfew and just an hour of outdoor exercise per day.
Is the sacrifice worth it?
Australia is at a crossroads with Covid. The confidence and pride <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020,</span> when lockdowns and isolation brought outbreaks to heel, have been replaced by doubt, fatigue and a bitter battle over how much freedom or risk should be allowed in a Delta-defined future.
Some states are trying desperately to hold on to what worked before, while New South Wales and Victoria, home to the country’s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are being forced by Delta outbreaks to find a more nuanced path forward. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has thrown his weight behind a plan to reopen <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">when 80 percent</span> of adults are fully vaccinated. But the road ahead may not be smooth — as shown by protests this week over a vaccine mandate — and state leaders are still insisting that they will go it alone.
“We might be looking at the country turning the clock back on itself,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a political theorist at the University of Sydney. “There is an explicit insularity and parochialism that now dictates debate.”",,,,,,,0,,,,,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6150cce0c62a1423bf29fc52,15283,"<h3>Pig Virus Threatens to Bump Pork Cost</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Disease Threatens to Create More Pain for Food Shoppers

Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 6</span>:56 pm ET

CHICAGO—A virus that kills young pigs is roiling the U.S. pork industry, boosting prices in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $9 billion</span> hog-futures market and threatening to create more pain for food shoppers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The disease, which has spread to farms <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 22 states</span>, is cutting into pork supplies and prompting some traders and investors to wager that hog prices could set records this year.</span> Lean-hog futures rose to a seven-week high a week ago and are <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 6% since</span> mid-December.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or the PED virus, appeared in the U.S. for the first time in April and has killed thousands of piglets since then. The virus, which causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, is fatal only to young pigs and poses no threat to human health or food safety, according to swine veterinarians. The U.S. strain is nearly identical to a version that curbed hog production in China <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span>

The extent of the impact is unclear because farms don't have to report incidents or death totals to federal regulators. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world's largest pork producer, and other meatpackers estimate that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> the nation's sows, or adult female hogs, have been infected by the virus, which can spread to their offspring.

Smithfield, a unit of China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., said last month the virus could result in a loss to U.S. pig production this year of two million to three million head, or up <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% of</span> the industry's total. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam, warned recently its earnings for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2014 could</span> be affected by ""potentially volatile hog costs"" due to the virus.

</span>To ward off the disease, many U.S. hog farmers are redoubling safety practices, including disinfecting equipment and workers' footwear. But many say they find it difficult to prevent.

""This is the toughest disease we've ever gone through,"" said Mike Brandherm, a general manager with Hitch Pork Producers, a Guymon, Okla., livestock producer that <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 30,000 piglets</span> in six weeks in <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2013 outbreak</span>. ""It was stunning how fast the disease spread. You feel helpless.""

Though outbreaks at Hitch's farms since then have been smaller, it continues to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lose 500 to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 600 piglets</span> a week, Mr. Brandherm said. ""We're still not back at the production levels we had prior to the disease,"" he said.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The hit to supplies is expected to contribute to higher bacon and pork-chop prices for U.S. consumers as well.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Retail pork prices likely will set a fresh record this year, breaking the nominal all-time high <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $3.81 a</span> pound reached in October, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The USDA projects <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2% to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3% increase</span> in retail pork prices <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span></span> after a gain of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1% last</span> year.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Mike Boero, the meat-department manager at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in Zion, Ill., says shoppers already are talking about higher bacon prices.</span> ""It's definitely gone up more than I can afford,"" he said. ""People are only buying it if it's on sale.<span id=""7"" class=""red"">""

Worries about the virus have pushed hog prices higher in the past few months.</span> But many traders said the impact on production likely won't show up in a significant way until spring and summer because the disease began to accelerate in October and piglets take around six months to reach slaughter weight.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">That sentiment has led to a wider-than-normal disparity in the price of hogs in the front-month contract—February—and for contracts with later dates, according to analysts.</span> On Friday, February hog futures <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.57 cent</span>, <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 0.7%,</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 85.82 cents</span> a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Prices hit the highest levels for a front-month contract in seven weeks on <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Jan 3.</span>

</span>The June contract, meanwhile, closed <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.009 a</span> pound, about a 15-cent premium over the February contract. Usually, the gap between the February and June hog contracts is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12 cents</span>, according to analysts. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Prices typically are higher in the summer because hogs tend to eat less when temperatures are high, which keeps them from gaining as much weight and reduces supplies.

</span>""The 900-pound gorilla sitting on those [later futures] contracts is the uncertainty due to PED virus,"" said Mike Zuzolo, president of brokerage Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Atchison, Kan.

Some traders and investors are cautious about placing too much emphasis on the virus. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">One factor that could offset the disease's impact on output is U.S. hog farmers are expected to expand their herds this year to take advantage of lower feed prices.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The cost of corn, typically the main ingredient in livestock feed, has slid <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40% in</span> the past year due to a large U.S. crop.</span> This has sharply improved hog farmers' profit margins.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Farmers also are packing more pounds on their animals because feed is cheap and they can capture higher prices from meatpackers for greater weights.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">""I think PED is a real threat, but we're going to need to see an actual shortage of pigs hit the market for futures to rally any higher,"" said Craig VanDyke, an analyst with Top Third Ag Marketing, an advisory firm in Chicago.</span> ""These heavier weights can easily make up for even a 2-3% drop in hog numbers.""

Even with the industry bracing for a smaller number of available hogs, the USDA forecasts U.S. pork production will <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rise 2% in</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 23.6 billion</span> pounds, from a year earlier, citing heavier hog weights.

Analysts note that some traders have made wrong bets in the past about how much the virus would affect supplies. For instance, traders who were expecting a big impact were surprised in the early winter to see U.S. hog supplies remain on par with a year earlier. That sent hog futures to an eight-month low on Dec.<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11.</span>

A question looming over the pork industry is whether farmers seeking to expand their herds will have their plans snuffed out by the appearance of the virus in their barns.

As of the first week of January,<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,084 separate</span> positive cases of the virus have been reported to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which tracks the disease. Each case may represent anywhere from one infected animal on a farm to thousands across a producer's operations. The U.S. has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 68,300 hog</span> farms, according to the USDA. Furthermore, these cases have no clear correlation with the number of deaths caused by the disease.

The industry is trying to develop vaccines to thwart the PED virus, but so far none is in widespread use. Researchers are unsure how the virus, first identified in the U.K. <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971,</span> entered the U.S.

Phil Borgic, a hog farmer in Nokomis, Ill., said he has invested at <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $5 million</span> in new facilities, enhanced ""biosecurity"" safeguards and new breeding animals in the past few months as he seeks to ramp up output while keeping the virus out of his herd.

Mr. Borgic <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $150,000 to</span> build a station where trailers that transport his pigs to packing plants must be washed and dried. Visitors to his barns must shower and put on new clothes and boots.

""We're doing whatever we can to keep it out,"" the 57-year-old said in an interview earlier this month.

On Friday, Mr. Borgic said that he'd discovered infected piglets on his farm.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Rich Nelson, chief strategist with brokerage Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Ill., said he thinks prices for hogs this summer could break the record closing high <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.0745 a</span> pound set in <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2011.</span></span> ""It appears that PED virus issues are going to beat out any herd expansion in<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span>"" Mr. Nelson said.

The upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.
The final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.
The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State. The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.
In the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC’s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.
Kickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time — 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there’s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl’s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.
Outside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L’Équipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).
After the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year’s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.
Local sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.
Now, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.
“When you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,” Demoff said.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“You get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.”
Temperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.
It’s been <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.
Across the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.
SoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.
Here are where temperature records were broken in 2021:
A common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, has been that this year’s Super Bowl is “just another game.”
“Obviously it’s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,” Burrow said after Friday’s practice, the last of the season.
Their opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year’s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.
But despite the Bengals’ relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
He said that he and Duke Tobin, the team’s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.
“They certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments — they have proven that over the last two months,” Taylor said. “It’s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we’ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.”
Nine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.
When Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.
Miller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.
Blocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals’ offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.
Burrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams’ pass rush if the Bengals can’t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ticket prices for this year’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.
The Bengals play in one of the league’s smallest markets, but their fans haven’t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).
While the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.
All fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.
Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor “mega” events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.
Away from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.
“You’re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,” Sikka said. “You should test to go to your Super Bowl party.”",,6,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adjustment, which applied only to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinances, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.5 percent</span> of the loan amount. That added <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,500 to</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $300,000 loan</span>.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 30,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 1</span>:37 pm ET

Mortgage rates dropped <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 4% for</span> the first time since early last year, adding to hopes for a revival in the housing market.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The average rate this week on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.99%,</span> mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Thursday.</span> That marks a fall of nearly a full percentage point from the highs of November. Some lenders have been offering rates well below that.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Lower rates stand to make mortgages more affordable for buyers, and the sharp fall so far <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 has</span> lifted optimism for a market that has cooled after years of torrid home price growth around the country.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Lower rates should “give a boost to the housing market, which has been on the upswing,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, citing home-sales data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The drop in mortgage rates tracks a decline in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which was recently at its lowest <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Yields have fallen amid concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for a protracted trade dispute with China.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economy has remained relatively strong during the first three months of the year.</span> It grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1%,</span> according to data released Thursday. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Still, concerns about an economic slowdown could weigh on the housing market, particularly after a mini boom earlier in the year.

HAMPTON, S.C.—The saga of disgraced South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh includes five deaths, millions of dollars allegedly absconded from clients and, in July, indictments accusing him of murdering his wife and son, to which he pleaded not guilty.

It also spawned a pair of explosive and potentially groundbreaking lawsuits, with one tentatively set to go to trial this fall.

On one side sits the family of Mallory Beach, a 19-year-old killed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 when</span> a boat driven by Mr. Murdaugh’s late son, Paul, crashed into a bridge to Parris Island. On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach’s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.

Mr. Parker denies his company’s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.

Mr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker’s Kitchen chain <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family’s assets are frozen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl’s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.

</span>“I’ve <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I’m really, really proud of,” Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won’t settle the case, because to settle would be “to have Parker’s name besmirched.”

“That’s what’s wrong with America now,” he said. “People should stand up for what’s right. And I’m standing up for the truth.”

The wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.

The litigation so far hasn’t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family’s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.

</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker’s team improperly plied a boat passenger’s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker’s team and a crisis communications firm.

Mr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker “for everything he’s got” because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker’s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.

“I can prove everything he did and I’m going to, and he’s going to write me a big check,” Mr. Tinsley said.

Power in county

The boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing.

</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor’s, or district attorney’s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family’s close working relationship with local law enforcement.

Before he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.

Based on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh’s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span>

In the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 7,</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh’s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The state’s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides “the background and the motive” for the double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. “It’s an incredible tragedy,” he said. “But we’re not responsible.”

Mr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul’s slight build didn’t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother’s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.

“When you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don’t even read the information on the ID, it’s apparent what’s going to happen,” Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren’t rigorously followed at Parker’s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.

</span>Night of drinking

The fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span>

Paul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker’s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III’s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.

Video footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver’s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander “Buster” Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $49 on</span> his mother’s credit card.

After Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.

The six young people met at Paul’s grandfather’s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast—a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry—at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.

On the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn’t have running lights. Just <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.

Several passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, “screaming, cussing and saying horrible things,” according to court documents.

At 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn’t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.

It took a week to find Ms. Beach’s body, which was facedown in the <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.

Paul’s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.

Mr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory’s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker’s company.

The hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.

Alex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach’s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.

That left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.

The wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.

Quirk in liability law

Mr. Parker,<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and “Chewy Ice,” which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.

As Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh’s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh’s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.

Ms. Cohen “takes the driver’s license,” Mr. Parker said. “She looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.” Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother’s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach’s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn’t follow other company policies.

“They’ve got great written policies,” Mr. Tinsley said. “If they did what they said they were going to do, I don’t think this happens.”

Mr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.

Ms. Cohen isn’t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.

Alcohol-enforcement authorities haven’t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen “did her due diligence,” by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">State law doesn’t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.

</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.

“You say ‘Well, wait a minute. If I’m one-millionth <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% liable</span>?’ ” said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. “How does that work? That’s not fair.” He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.

The law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.

In December<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Mr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker’s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.

Mr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker’s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.

Super Bowl party

Rhett Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.

When asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, “Not that she knows of.” He added, “They had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.”

Mr. Parker said he can’t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said “we sure as heck wouldn’t have directed anybody to break the law,” including by buying alcohol for someone underage.

Mr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker’s investigation wouldn’t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn’t the cause of the boat crash. “There’s only one conclusion,” he said in an interview. Mr. Parker’s side was “collecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.”

A lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.

The suit also alleges that Mr. Parker’s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach’s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.

Mr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker’s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.

The suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for “Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,” a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.

Ms. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that “whoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules” and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.

Mr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn’t seek the family’s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.

In December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.

Edward Fenno, Ms. Ward’s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward’s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.

The completed “Murdaugh Murders” documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn’t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach’s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker’s legal team but haven’t made public.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.

“We were trying to find out who and what we were up against,” Mr. Parker said.

Mr. Parker said he didn’t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn’t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach’s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker’s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.

Mr. Roman published <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward’s documentary. Mr. Parker’s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman’s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker’s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.

Mr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were “engaged to gather information for news purposes” and not part of a conspiracy.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh’s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer’s double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family’s influence.

“When I look back on this [investigation], do I think ‘Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn’t have done that?’ ” Mr. Parker said. “Absolutely not. I’m proud of the work we did.”

When asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. “Here’s a better question,” he said. “ ‘So what?’ Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.”

As to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, “which was pretty easy to do.” He added: “This life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.”

Mr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.

The outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker’s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker’s lawyers say <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.

Mr. Donehue’s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker’s team in the spring <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span> “Mr. Parker’s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,” Ms. Senn said in an email. “I hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.”

Mr. Parker’s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.

Mr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker’s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.

Layers of connections

Some of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina’s close-knit legal community.

Mr. Tinsley,<span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden’s ambassador to Slovenia.

Mr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group—unrelated to Mr. Parker—including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.

Mr. Parker’s team includes some of the state’s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump’s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.

Mr. Parker’s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook’s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach’s boyfriend and Mr. Cook’s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.

In a preview of Mr. Parker’s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj “P.K.” Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker’s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach’s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn’t, according to depositions.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.

</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook’s lawsuit. “He said I’m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of Jägermeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I’m responsible?”

Joe McCulloch, Mr. Cook’s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. “Mutiny on the Bounty wouldn’t have ended well for anybody,” Mr. McCulloch said.

South Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn’t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. “Very few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,” Mr. McCulloch said. “His willingness to point the finger isn’t surprising.”

Mr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker’s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.

</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker’s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.

</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was “looking into how the association would fit in” with the coalition’s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn’t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 54 of</span><span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.

State Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn’t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn’t benefit the public.

Updated Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 1</span>:51 am ET

SEOUL—Kim Jong Un was a virtual unknown when his father died of a heart attack in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2011 and</span> left him the leader of North Korea.

Intelligence analysts knew little more than he was a man in his 20s who had attended school in Switzerland and loved basketball. Some guessed Mr. Kim, third in a line of Kim-family dictators, would be a weak, short-lived ruler. Governments abroad feared a violent collapse, but also hoped that the end of the family’s rule would reduce North Korea’s nuclear threat.

Instead of chaos, however, there appeared to be a plan, according to experts on the tightly closed country.

Mr. Kim has solidified his command by cloaking brutality in the folksy style and pragmatic politics of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation’s founder whom many still regard with nostalgia and reverence. Mr. Kim has mirrored his grandfather’s propaganda and policies, even his style of dress.

While purging potential challengers, particularly among North Korea’s generals, Mr. Kim has strengthened his military support with a nuclear-arms push.

In short, Mr. Kim has turned out to be a “very skilled dictator,” said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert and professor at Troy University in Seoul.

After its latest nuclear test this month, North Korea said it could now rapidly churn out nuclear warheads for its missiles, a claim impossible to verify. Experts suspect North Korea is only a few years away from the capability of striking the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While buttressing the military with arms spending, Mr. Kim has gained domestic backing and prestige with high-profile construction projects in the capital city of Pyongyang, say defectors, and by allowing growth of a rudimentary market economy—though his popularity is difficult to accurately gauge.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">North Korea has more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 million</span> mobile-phone subscribers and a new class of private traders and financiers despite the country’s official communist orthodoxy, defectors say.

</span>To the rest of the world, Mr. Kim’s acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear program—more powerful bombs and improved missiles to deliver them—makes him an especially dangerous leader.

Looking back, it appears that Kim Jong Un and his aides likely decided from the start that the new leader should emulate his popular grandfather rather than his dour father, said Michael Madden, a U.S.-based North Korea expert. Many of those aides worked with both previous leaders.

For starters, Kim Jong Un looked remarkably like a younger version of his grandfather, both in his stocky build and facial features. Mr. Kim, believed now to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be 32 years</span> old, had his hair closely cropped in his grandfather’s style and wore the black Mao-style uniforms and western suits favored by Kim Il Sung.

The embalmed body of Kim Il Sung, who ruled from the country’s founding <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1948 until</span> his death <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994,</span> lies in a viewing case at an airport-sized mausoleum. Most citizens wear a badge with his picture on the left side of their chest.

He is known in North Korea for leading guerrilla forces against Japanese colonists in the 1930s. He triggered the Korean War <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1950 by</span> invading South Korea, but North Korean schools teach that he saved the country from the armies of Seoul and Washington.

Kim Il Sung is also remembered for his country’s relative prosperity after the war, helped by North Korea’s concentration of heavy industry and mineral resources. For around two decades, North Korea’s estimated output surpassed South Korea’s. Even some defectors laud his skills in hindsight.

By contrast, Kim Il Sung’s son and successor, Kim Jong Il, ruled during a 1990s famine that killed more than a million people. Under a so-called military-first policy, he demanded austerity from rank-and-file citizens to make sure the armed forces had all the resources they needed.

Kim Jong Il cracked down on private wealth while enjoying a lavish private lifestyle. His khaki jumpsuits drew ridicule abroad. He also was a recluse, whose voice was broadcast only once during his 17-year rule.

These days, state propaganda highlight his son, Kim Jong Un, as a man of the people, just like his grandfather. A few months after he assumed power, state TV showed him bringing gifts and pouring drinks for families who had just moved into new apartments in Pyongyang. His wife washed dishes.

Kim Jong Un also moved away from his father’s demands for austerity. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Instead, he resurrected a policy of his grandfather’s known as the dual-track: The state would pursue both economic growth and nuclear weapons.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Kim has thousands of soldiers building recreational and housing projects in Pyongyang, which are showcased by state-run newspapers and TV as evidence of economic advancement.

</span>Alongside a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and redeveloped streets in Pyongyang, known among foreigners as “Little Dubai,” are new riding stables, a water park and dolphin aquarium. Visitors to the new zoo enter through a gate shaped like a giant tiger’s mouth.

An analysis of state media reports on tours by North Korean leaders shows <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 20% of</span> Kim Jong Un’s so-called guidance visits have been at leisure spots and construction projects, places where his father rarely appeared.

During a visit—billed as an inspection—to the Pyongyang zoo this year, Mr. Kim said it would help visitors see North Korea’s “strength and civilization.”

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">North Korean officials say these projects show that economic pressures from abroad are futile.</span> ”You can see that sanctions on us have no effect,” a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said in a recent interview.

Outside the country, those claims draw skepticism. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Pyongyang releases no official economic statistics, but South Korea’s central bank estimates that North Korea’s economy grew around half a percentage point each year <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2010 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> driven mostly by mineral exports.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Two Western diplomats who recently traveled through rural North Korea on separate visits said clear signs of poverty remained.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Yet a loosening of economic restrictions appears to be raising living standards a bit, according to defectors and recent visitors.

</span>Despite North Korea’s longstanding ban on private enterprise, Mr. Kim has allowed some street markets and small businesses. Smartphones are hot sellers, though primarily Chinese-made models that don’t connect to the internet, which is largely banned. Such illegal goods as foreign movies recorded on memory cards are also sold in markets, said Sokeel Park of the group Liberty in North Korea, a nongovernmental organization that helps defectors.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Kim Kwang-Jin, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and banker, said Mr. Kim has tolerated free-market sales as a potential source of tax income.

</span>The dictator’s populist image is cultivated by state media accounts of Mr. Kim getting angry with officials who, for instance, give incorrect weather forecasts or let weeds sprout through the pavement of an amusement park.

Kim Jong Un’s public image of warmth toward his citizens contrasts with his ruthless elimination of potential rivals, including <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2013 execution</span> of his uncle, whom he called “factional filth.” Mr. Kim has demoted or purged more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 top</span> officials, according to South Korean government estimates.

Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House National Security Council for two years from mid-2013, said U.S. officials became increasingly persuaded of Mr. Kim’s potential longevity as his rule progressed.

“Once the major purges took place, we thought he was solid,” said Mr. Medeiros, who is now Asia head for consultancy Eurasia Group.

Kim Jong Un’s grandfather also consolidated power through purges of potential challengers <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1953,</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1956,</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1967.</span> None, however, were known to rival the execution by antiaircraft fire of a North Korean defense minister under Mr. Kim, as alleged last year by South Korea’s spy agency.

The recent purges appear to pave the way for Mr. Kim to reassert the authority of the ruling Workers’ Party, another echo of his grandfather’s. The party was used by Kim Il Sung to oversee and control his citizens and government. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">His son, Kim Jong Il, ceded more authority to the military, allowing it take over lucrative businesses in mining and foreign trade.

</span>This year, at the first party congress <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 years</span>, Mr. Kim replaced a military-dominated governing body with one made up mostly of politicians. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Analysts say the shift also puts economic management back in the hands of presumably more capable technocrats.

</span>While reducing the role of the military in politics, Mr. Kim has accelerated the development of weapons of mass destruction, his grandfather’s dream.

Kim Il Sung started North Korea’s nuclear program with help from the Soviet Union. After the collapse of its former patron, the former North Korean leader agreed to a deal with the U.S. <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994 that</span> froze Pyongyang’s nuclear work for almost a decade. It later emerged that North Korea had maintained a secret program to enrich uranium, one type of fuel for an atomic bomb.

Three of North Korea’s five nuclear tests have been conducted under Kim Jong Un’s reign, and he has more than doubled <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 16 ballistic</span> missile tests held under his father.

Recent successful tests of missiles launched from a mobile carrier and a submarine show North Korea is also gaining the capacity to hit back even if its military bases are destroyed.

“The U.S.’s failed policy has allowed us to build a full nuclear deterrent, including counterstrike ability,” the senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said.

U.S. officials say they have pursued all avenues to reduce the threat from North Korea. Earlier this year, U.S. officials offered talks about ending the armed standoff on the Korean Peninsula if Pyongyang would discuss scrapping its nuclear program. The idea was rejected.

Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, used North Korea’s nuclear weapons program as a bargaining chip for aid and security guarantees. Diplomats and experts say Mr. Kim uses the nuclear program instead to enhance his standing with the military and to intimidate South Korea, with little concern for diplomatic fallout. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Even ties with China—the North’s economic lifeline, defender and sole major ally—have been strained by Mr. Kim’s nuclear push.

</span>Mr. Kim’s unexpected resilience has forced Washington to recalculate the scale of the threat North Korea poses to the world, as well as U.S. responses.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The U.S. and its allies have pledged to step up economic sanctions against North Korea.</span> The U.S. has little power to directly pressure Pyongyang because it has almost no links to the isolated regime. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Efforts are instead focused on persuading countries with economic and diplomatic ties to North Korea.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The U.S. would like to reduce North Korea’s export of coal and other minerals, almost all of which are sold to China.</span> Beijing, however, is strongly resistant to any action that might destabilize North Korea and send a flood of refugees over its shared border. China also sees North Korea as a strategic buffer against U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.

Recent high-level defections, including the second-in-command of Pyongyang’s U.K. embassy, have raised speculation of unrest among the elite. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">South Korean officials say Mr. Kim’s brutality and demand for foreign currency is causing fractures.

</span>A steady diet of propaganda, meanwhile, has pressed home a message that security from nuclear arms outweighs the dangers they may bring, a point of view that is apparently bolstering Mr. Kim’s support.

“Some people in North Korea worried about war,” said Choi Sul-Kyung, a 28-year-old North Korean soldier who defected last year. “But they also thought we might win.”

The new models, for coastal areas stretching from Cape May to the Hudson Valley, will be used to shape the city’s future zoning, development and building standards to help it become more sustainable.

The agency proposed preliminary maps <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 </span>— soon after Hurricane Sandy — that would have doubled both the area of flood zones and the number of people inside them. The city, in an unusual move, successfully challenged the scientific assumptions underlying the new maps.
In the coming weeks, formal discussions on the maps between New York City and the agency will likely begin.
There is no time to waste, said Mr. Martin, who has been on assignment in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. “Sandy may not happen again like it did,” he said, “but there will be something very similar, and it’s not that far off.”
But the process will not be fast, and homeowners should be prepared to be in “limbo” for years, said Daniel A. Zarrilli, the city’s chief resilience officer and senior director for climate policy and programs. That may not be ideal, he said, but it is “better than it could have been had the city not worked to protect affordability and incorporate climate risks onto the maps. We don’t want to jack up insurance rates and cause a foreclosure crisis, and we want a smoother glide path to a better flood insurance program, and more accurate maps.”Continue reading the main story
An Affordability Challenge
The first time FEMA mapped the city was <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1983.</span> Since then, only minor changes have been made. The agency was working on an update, as requested by the city, when Hurricane Sandy hit.
A month later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane.
The audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone.
In the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.2 percent</span> chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 10 percent</span> risk of having a fire.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance.
</span>But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 80 percent</span> of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance.
Indeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact. One recent federal report estimated there was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 40 percent</span> “uncertainty of flood predictions.”
<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA’s proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation — the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood — by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, “unnecessarily putting <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 26,000 buildings</span> <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 170,000 residents</span>” in higher-risk locations and “causing an affordability challenge.”
In March, at the city’s request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps’ potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The report found that the proposed maps could “reduce property values, increase loan defaults, lower tax revenue, and create hardships for current residents.</span>”Continue reading the main story
One area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2013 proposal</span></span>, the difference for the area is stark: <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Just 26 buildings</span> were in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1983 FEMA</span> flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5,000 buildings</span>.
Canarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But in a neighborhood that weathered the city’s highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have “little to put toward mitigating their flood risk,” according to a city report released in May.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery.</span> By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established.
With such coverage, premiums would probably be <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $500 a</span> year; without it, the annual rates could <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $3,000.</span>
But <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">even $500 a</span> year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood.
On Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA’s flood zones. If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone.
“If you get flood insurance, you can’t pay your other bills,” he said.
Theresa Fraser lives on Canarsie Road, a half mile from Jamaica Bay. About two feet of water rushed into her basement during Hurricane Sandy.
After seeking advice from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that created a flood mapping tool, she purchased flood insurance to qualify for FEMA disaster funds. But Ms. Fraser, a day-care teacher, dropped it after a year because she could not afford <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $600 annual</span> premium.
“I definitely don’t want to be in a high-risk zone, but I don’t want to move,” said Ms. Fraser, a Guyanese immigrant who moved into her <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">house 20 years</span> ago. “You can’t always run from one place to the next because you’re worried things will happen.”
One clue to the possible contours of any future maps may be found in a single column buried in the city’<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2015 appeal</span>.
The city estimated that if the scientific errors were removed from FEMA’s revision, the number of people in the flood zone could increase <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6 percent</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 230,000 over</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1983 maps</span>, and the number of one- to four-family buildings could grow <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 38 percent</span> <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 36,000.</span> Both increases would be much smaller than <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 100 percent</span> jumps suggested by FEMA’s initial maps.Continue reading the main story
The Most Vulnerable ZIP Code
When homeowners suffer flood damage, they file claims. And of <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 116 properties</span> in New York City that have filed multiple FEMA claims in the <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 20 years</span>, more than a quarter have not been in the flood zone, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Two areas have had the most properties with repeat flood claims. One is Broad Channel, in Queens.
The other is <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10465 ZIP</span> code in the Bronx, in the shadow of the Throgs Neck Bridge, home to Edgewater Park.
Edgewater Park is a tightknit and predominantly white community that feels more like a seaside village than a city neighborhood. But its beauty is also a burden, explained Deborah A. Roff, president of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative.
<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1992,</span> a nor’easter nearly drowned the neighborhood. Then there was the concussive trifecta of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Sandy <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 to</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> strewing debris far inland and leaving gashes in houses that remain uninhabitable.
But now, what really worries Ms. Roff and her neighbors is not the next storm, but the federal government.
“They’re not even afraid of the storms, because with the flood, you can pray — ‘Jesus, please don’t let the flood come,’” said Ms. Roff. “They’re more afraid of the regulations and the flood insurance because they’re getting the bill, and they’ve got to pay that bill.”
The various maps that the residents have used to determine the flood boundaries — whether from FEMA, the Department of City Planning or other sources — offer conflicting results about whether a house is in the flood plain, Ms. Roff said. On her own block of bungalows, she said, one homeowner <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pays $5,000 a</span> year in premiums. A few doors down, another does not have insurance. Just beyond that, a new homeowner is <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $300,000 to</span> raise a <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">house 20 feet</span> like “a castle in the sky,” she said, thereby avoiding paying any insurance.
By working with the City Planning department to allow for more flood-resilient construction and investment, to be paid for, at least in part, by higher maintenance fees, Ms. Roff hopes to minimize the community’s risks, even if it means that its residents have to pay more.
“Fair is fair — we don’t want to hurt anyone else by fixing this issue,” she said.Continue reading the main story
A Difference of Two Feet
While the maps are probably years away, the process has already influenced how the city builds, especially along a waterfront that has become more accessible yet more expensive.
<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2010,</span> the value of property within the 100-year floodplain <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $58.7 billion</span>, according to a report by Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 2014,</span> that value had climbed <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $129.1 billion</span>, making it more urgent to invest in resiliency projects, Mr. Stringer concluded.
Moreover, FEMA’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2013 proposal</span></span> to expand the flood maps applies to all new or substantially improved buildings. That means more buildings are now subject to tougher building codes enacted after Hurricane Sandy.
Some residential and commercial developers are embracing the standards as a vital long-term investment.
One such project is Greenpoint Landing in Brooklyn, an 11-building, 22-acre development that will <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">add 5,500 apartments</span> on a former industrial site. The project, now under construction, features a terraced esplanade park that rises like steps from the East River, which will be filled with absorbent material to protect against storm surges, high winds and more.
Ultimately, the project will raise the waterfront by about three to five feet above the existing coastline, said Karen Tamir, principal with James Corner Field Operations, a landscape architecture and urban planning firm that is designing the project.Continue reading the main story
In October, the Waterfront Alliance, a coalition that works to protect New York’s waterways and shoreline, said that the project had satisfied the alliance’s Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines, a new ratings system reminiscent of the LEED certification program for green buildings.
“If you bake the retrofit into your costs now, it’s a marginal investment, and it protects your property and, more importantly, the people who will live there,” said Roland Lewis, the alliance’s president and chief executive.
In some cases, however, the reaction has been to get out of the flood zone, in any possible way.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Consider a project in TriBeCa to convert a 10-story office building <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 Beach</span> Street into luxury condominiums priced at up <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $12 million</span> apiece.
</span>Constructed <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1900,</span> the building was outside the original FEMA flood zones. But the southeast corner of the building would fall inside the newer zones, “thus subjecting the entire building to FEMA regulations,” according to documents filed with the city’s Department of Buildings in <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2013.</span>
At first, the project’s developer, HFZ Capital Group, and its architects believed that they would be exempt, in part because the affected piece of the building, on the corner of Beach Street and St. Johns Lane, was so small. But city officials said that was not the case.
So the architects proposed an ingenious solution: slice two feet off the bottom corner of the building.
After consulting with FEMA, the city ultimately concluded that the proposal “shall absolve the applicant from complying.”Continue reading the main story",,,,,4,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6150cce0c62a1423bf29fc52,42242,"<h3>Opinion | Homeowners aren’t ready to face how much less their houses are worth</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Over the years, I have encountered a lot of weird statements from company chief executives announcing layoffs or business setbacks.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But possibly the strangest one came on Wednesday from Redfin chief executive Glenn Kelman, who said his firm was letting go <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 13 percent</span> of its workforce, and shuttering its “iBuying” division, which bought homes directly from consumers, did light renovations and put them back on the market.
</span>Anyone who has watched a house-flipping show knows how hard it can be to make money that way. Around this time last year, Zillow closed its own iBuying division after losing buckets of money. Yet this is not how Kelman explained his move. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We’re closing our iBuying business, RedfinNow,” he said in a statement, “because maintaining a profit with rising interest rates would make our offers on homes insultingly low.”
</span>Insultingly! <span id=""3"" class=""red"">What is insulting about offering people the market price for their house?</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Homeowners are presumably aware that mortgage rates have spiked, thanks to the Federal Reserve Board’s aggressive policy, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topping 7 percent</span> in the latest report from Freddie Mac.</span> And because owners already have homes and mortgages, they are also aware that when rates are higher, people cannot afford to pay as much for houses.
And yet I don’t think Kelman is crazy; he’s probably right. Many homeowners would be insulted by what Redfin could rationally offer. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">His statement is strange because the housing market is in a very strange place — and finding a new normal will require some ugly adjustments, psychological as well as financial.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">As I noted in June, most American homeowners have known only a world of steadily falling interest rates.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates hit their all-time high in the early 1980s, as the Fed under Paul Volcker aggressively tightened monetary policy to fight record inflation.</span> Since then, rates have followed a long downward trend. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Prices responded with a corresponding upward trend — albeit with some brutal interruptions, most notably, the collapse of the housing bubble <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2006.</span>
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">During the financial crisis, however, the Fed stepped in with more easy money, and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2022 most</span> homeowners were sitting on a nice chunk of equity.</span> This made homeowners feel prosperous and secure. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It probably also boosted consumer demand, because people who feel richer are willing to spend more.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">And despite the memories of the crash, most people still take it for granted that housing is a great investment as well as a way to keep the rain off their heads.
</span>These trends could not go on forever. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">During the pandemic, my credit union was offering 15-year fixed-rate mortgages for less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> annual interest, and they weren’t going to keep lowering that rate until they were paying me money to buy a house.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Now, we are in the midst of a sharp reversal and prices will have to adjust accordingly.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Someone who could have gotten a mortgage <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 percent</span> a few years ago now has to pay more than twice that.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">To keep their mortgage payment the same, the cost of the house would have to fall by almost half.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Now, not everyone has to worry so much about their monthly payment; older home buyers who have built up some equity aren’t as sensitive to mortgage rates.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But unless prices drop significantly, the market will be starved of new entrants — which means falling demand and, ultimately, lower prices.
</span>Home buyers aren’t yet ready to recognize the extent of that loss, so they won’t sell their homes unless they really, really have to. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Especially because moving would mean giving up the absurdly low mortgage rates that prevailed before the Fed got serious about fighting inflation.
</span>Many of the real estate listings in my neighborhood now have an eerie quality, like looking at the twinkling light of some long-dead star. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Houses sit on the market or prices drift downward in tiny increments that are wholly inadequate to the magnitude of the interest-rate shift.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Though supply remains quite low by historical standards, inventories are rising, and sales have fallen by almost a quarter.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Homeowners seem to be sitting out the market, waiting for the return of the good times.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">This helps explain why median sales prices have fallen by only <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span>, from a June high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $413,800 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $384,800 in</span> September — and were still up year-over-year.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Of course, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7 percent</span> decline might be a good deal if interest rates fall back to where they were fairly quickly.</span> Home buyers could suffer a high payment for a couple of years, and then refinance into something more affordable — and sellers could avoid taking a hit to their personal wealth. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">That’s one way we could get out of this strange market.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">But it’s hard to imagine that interest rates are going back to where they were during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The public health crisis is over, and the Fed is now in inflation-fighting mode.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">We homeowners might never again be as rich as we felt <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 and</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021 </span>— which would mean that the only way the market can go back to normal is for us to eventually, painfully admit that we’re poorer, and move on.</span>",,,,,4,,,3,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Worries about corporate revenue peaking and a slowdown in China and Europe potentially spilling over into the U.S. economy have sent stocks into a tailspin.</span> Fast-growing internet firms have been some of the hardest hit during the turmoil, leading analysts to question whether companies that previously seemed immune to global growth fears can continue surging ahead.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Quarterly sales from Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet disappointed investors, sending the two stocks sharply lower Friday and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its worst week since March.

Businesses pump water from aquifers in New Zealand and Australia, prompting protests
On the east coast of New Zealand, a Chinese-owned company has been pumping increasing amounts of water from a local aquifer to quench growing demand among consumers for high-end spring water.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Sales of bottled water by OnePure International Group have grown exponentially since it opened for business five years ago, and most of its products are shipped to China and other parts of Asia.</span> Last year it pumped close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3 million</span> gallons of spring water from below one of New Zealand’s prime wine-growing districts, to the chagrin of some in the local community.
“We are worried it could become problematic,” said Leanne Cotter-Arlidge, who runs a nonprofit in Hawke’s Bay, the region where OnePure and six other bottled-water operations have been tapping aquifers. The concern, she said, is that the companies will extract too much water and deprive cities and farms in the area of a valuable resource. Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.
OnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China’s growing market.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">China currently consumes <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world’s supply of the product, according to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 20 gallons</span>—or <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles—a year, and analysts expect the country’s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.
</span>Water resources within China are limited. The country <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 20% of</span> the world’s population and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 7% of</span> the world’s fresh water. Around one-quarter of that is polluted—in part because of industrial production and intensive farming practices—according to a January report from China National Environmental Monitoring Center.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">As people care more about the quality of tap water, they are more likely to turn to bottled water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.
</span>Four of <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The country’s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2013 and</span><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade data.
</span>New Zealand has become an attractive destination for Chinese companies that want to use the country’s environmentally pristine image to sell bottled water. A few years ago, the country’s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country’s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.
<span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> Nongfu’s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country’s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.
The plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community’s own needs.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“This is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,” it said.
</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand’s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean’s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We need to protect our water supply for our community,” said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“If there wasn’t the potential for such growth in demand…no one would be panicking.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">“It’s a very competitive market,” Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com’s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.

Updated</span> Nov.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 2</span>:00 pm ET

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced Monday that its leader William Dudley is planning to step down early and retire in the middle of next year.

In a press release, the bank said Mr. Dudley is planning to leave ahead of the end of his current term’s conclusion in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2019 </span>“to ensure that a successor is in place well before the end of his term.”

Mr. Dudley’s impending retirement had been a matter of speculation for central bank observers for a while, but many were caught off guard by the accelerated timetable. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley will be leaving the Fed at a time of considerable change for the institution.

</span>President Donald Trump has nominated central bank governorJerome Powell to replace current Chairwoman Janet Yellen early next year when her leadership term ends. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last month, Fed vice-chair Stanley Fischer resigned from the bank.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a statement, Ms. Yellen said of Mr. Dudley that “the American economy is stronger and the financial system safer because of his many thoughtful contributions.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley was a close ally of Ms. Yellen, and she acknowledged as much, saying she appreciated his “wise counsel and warm friendship throughout the years of the financial crisis and its aftermath.”

News of Mr. Dudley’s impending retirement first broke over the weekend.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Speculation now moves to who will take over a key leadership role, running the part of the central bank that deals directly with Wall Street and implements monetary policy.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“I am extremely proud of the work we have done in New York, and as a System, from our efforts to help the nation navigate the financial crisis to beginning the process of normalizing the balance sheet to our work on reforming the culture of the financial services industry,” Mr. Dudley said in a statement.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">At an appearance later Monday before the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Dudley joked about why he moved up his exit date.</span> “Gee, retiring to play golf in January? That doesn’t make a lot of sense.” <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He added that he was “sad” to leave the Fed.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists have generally been praiseworthy of Mr. Dudley’s role on the monetary policy front, but the outgoing official has long faced criticism over his bank’s oversight over the financial industry, where it is a major regulator.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In his appearance Monday, Mr. Dudley addressed central bank leadership flux and the fact that Mr. Powell breaks with recent decades’ practice in not being a Fed chairman who is also an economist.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley described himself as a “big fan” of Mr. Powell and new Fed vice chairman for supervision Randall Quarles.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The Fed will do just fine” with what’s certain to be a “smooth transition,” Mr. Dudley said.</span> While a lot may be going on, he added “if you are going to have a transition, this is a heck of a lot better of a time to have a transition than <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007.</span>”

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley sought to downplay the importance of any one person in determining Fed policy.</span> He noted officials right now are very much on one page in terms of the outlook. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He added that the Fed’s staff is also very important to the functioning of the institution, and pointed to them as a bulwark of stability during the leadership change.

They include a moratorium on evictions due to nonpayment of rent until Aug.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span></span> which extends the <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ban 60 days</span> past its original end date in June. It applies to both residential and commercial tenants.
“People literally are worried about being able to pay rent. You don’t work for two months and that rent bill keeps coming in,” he said at a press conference Thursday.
Cuomo added that he is banning any fees on late rent payments. Additionally, landlords must continue to let tenants dip into their security deposits to pay rent.
“I hope it gives families a deep breath. Nothing can happen until Aug.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span></span>” he said, noting they will continue to assess the situation between now and then.

Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world
Bank reserves are normally obscure, even to bankers and professional investors.</span> But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs—known as the overnight repo rate—to spike. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a worry, because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> but it shot up almost as high <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% on</span> Tuesday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market.</span> That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">To settle markets down, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has dipped into this market, conducting three auctions this week where banks could swap Treasurys (or bonds from institutions like Fannie Mae ) for new reserves.</span> It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $75 billion</span> in repos.
Here’s is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they’ve come to matter.
What are reserves?
Not many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.
Central bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called “reserves.” The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks.
There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.
What are reserves for?
The main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.
But that’s not what really happens. In fact, the first person’s bank reduces the amount in the person’s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes to them. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person’s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don’t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.
</span>Where do reserves come from?
One way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Whether it wants to pay government workers’ wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government’s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money.</span> That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds.</span> The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.
Where does QE come in?
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of QE—quantitative easing—was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.
</span>Central banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.
</span>And then the Federal Reserve started to reverse QE?
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Yes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank.</span> An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer’s bank account disappears.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.
</span>So why does this all suddenly matter now?
This is the trillion-dollar question. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn’t sure how much reserves banks need these days.</span> New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.
Newsletter Sign-up
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market, and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">One key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">If banks don’t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere.</span> They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions.</span> Unless that is, it turns out that the problem isn’t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn’t yet been identified.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve rolled out eight emergency actions this week, establishing a special backstop for money-market mutual funds (typically a risk-free place for investors to store cash), slashing interest rates to zero and restarting the crisis-era bond-buying program known as “quantitative easing.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The central bank also announced plans to buy short-term business loans known as commercial paper, ramped up “swap lines” with foreign central banks to ensure other nations have enough dollars, allowed banks to borrow money from the Fed at <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.25 percent</span> interest rate and announced loans for primary dealers of U.S. Treasury bonds.

Signs of progress in the war against covid-19 stoked some positive feelings on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar, which had skyrocketed as worried investors rushed to secure greenbacks, weakened against other currencies.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2,</span></span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 7</span>:38 pm ET

Longfin Corp. <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">LFIN 0.00</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle took advantage of post-financial-crisis rules designed to create jobs and help young companies go public.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the financial-technology company, which was valued <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $5.4 billion</span> as recently <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10 days</span> ago, is now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it failed to disclose important information and left a trail of misstatements behind.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Since Longfin’s December initial public offering, which <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $5.7 million</span>, the company’s price first rose 13-fold, then fell <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 80%,</span> all in less than four months.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the run-up to the IPO, the company, which says it operates computer platforms for trading on the Singapore and other stock exchanges, failed to disclose important information and misstated facts as basic as the age of its controlling shareholder, according to a review of securities filings.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">On Monday, the company disclosed the SEC probe while also reporting material weaknesses in financial controls.</span> The company, which said it is cooperating with the probe, said it may not be able to continue as a going concern.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The shares closed Monday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 17% at</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $14.31,</span> above its IPO price <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.</span>

Longfin went public using a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2012,</span> known as Reg A+.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The rules allow companies with less <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 billion</span> in annual sales to bypass some accounting and disclosure requirements imposed on bigger companies, but they do require accurate reporting.

</span>The other nine Reg A+ IPOs that have listed on U.S. exchanges or been issued over the counter have lost more than half their value on average, Dealogic data show.

Concerns about Longfin shine a light on the apparent ease with which IPOs are being approved under the Reg A+ regime, lawyers said. “Everyone understood we were rationalizing the disclosures [required] but nothing as flimsy as what appears to have happened here,” said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University. “We’re going to look back on Reg A+ and think this was an experiment that didn’t get managed very well.”

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The SEC gave Longfin the green light to sell shares based on one month’s audited financial statements, which showed <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 96% of</span> the company’s expenses were paid to a company controlled by Longfin’s owner, Venkat Meenavalli, an Indian entrepreneur.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The company also provided two years of audited statements for a Singaporean subsidiary, which generates most of its revenue.

</span>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.

Mr. Meenavalli, who says he <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">controls 90% of</span> Longfin shares, told The Wall Street Journal he is “based out of Dubai” but intends to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend 15 days</span> a month in the U.S. He said its sole U.S. office space—a small room with three desks and no computers in a shared-office building in downtown Manhattan that was deserted at 9:30 on a recent weekday morning—is temporary. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Longfin plans to open a bigger office in New York and is hiring more U.S. employees, he added.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Meenavalli rejects any suggestion of financial misconduct, saying short sellers, who have borrowed and sold short <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 15% of</span> the shares available to trade, according to FactSet, are motivated by greed.</span> “They enter into their own fire,” he said.

A tiny portion of Longfin shares were sold in the Dec.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 IPO</span>. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Two days later, Longfin disclosed that its chief financial officer and chief operating officer had resigned just before the offering.</span> But on the same day, the company said it had acquired a crypto company, Ziddu.com, from a company controlled by Mr. Meenavalli.

Longfin shares rose more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200% over</span> the next two sessions to a peak value <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $72.38.</span>

Mr. Meenavalli <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 48 years</span> old, according to records he confirmed in an interview, although in a <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2017 SEC</span> filing he is listed <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 45.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Described in that filing as “a financial wizard,” his biographies for some earlier companies show him having a computer-science degree from Australia’s Suffield University.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">His Longfin biography lists a diploma in international trade finance from Middlesex University in the U.K.

In SEC filings, Longfin reported it <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 20 employees</span> in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2017.</span></span> The number dropped to two the following month, rose <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 in</span> July, fell to three in November and was reported <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 18 on</span> Monday. A filing in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2017 listed</span> Sarah Altahawi,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> as a New York-based executive. Ms. Altahawi said Monday she is not a company officer, “so that was a mistake.”

Her father, Andy Altahawi, said she was a secretary. He was <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">issued 2 million</span> Longfin shares for advising on its IPO, according to filings. He said he “managed the SEC process as a consultant” and didn’t act as a banker or underwriter. Mr. Altahawi was listed on Longfin’s website as a director until September, when the SEC questioned why he wasn’t included in the company’s filings.

“I’m not a director...never was—what was online was untrue,” he said. Mr. Meenavalli said Mr. Altahawi was an officer for two months but then resigned and declined an invitation to join the board.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">At its peak value, Longfin was included for eight trading days in the <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 2000 small</span>-company stock index, which would draw in some of <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $122 billion</span> in funds that follow the index.</span> Short-sellers said Russell made a mistake because <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 1.5% of</span> Longfin’s shares traded, below <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 5% minimum</span>. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Russell said it made the decision based on Longfin’s IPO disclosures, which said more shares would trade.</span> Its reversal, announced <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 26,</span> sent the shares <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 41% the</span> next day.

Mr. Meenavalli told the Journal Friday that the company now has <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7% free</span> float thanks to the unlocking of some IPO shares. Mr. Meenavalli said Russell told him “they are going to include us back.”

A spokesman for Russell said Longfin would be assessed like any other company during the next quarterly index update. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The spokesman also confirmed that the Journal’s calculation, based on available information, that <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 4% of</span> the shares are available for trading “is accurate.”

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Mr. Meenavalli said Longfin “went through a stringent process of [approval by] SEC and Nasdaq” and that its filings are being unfairly judged against the tougher standards set for bigger companies.

Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:00 am ET

Fierce competition to underwrite debt offerings in Asia’s booming U.S.-dollar bond market is forcing some big global banks to work on deals for next to nothing.

</span>Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">STAN 0.13</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle were among seven banks that recently helped sell a total <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.3 billion</span> in dollar-denominated bonds from three state-owned Indian companies, effectively providing their services free of charge. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The three Indian companies paid a dollar in underwriting fees to each bank that handled the sales, according to company representatives and people familiar with the matter.

</span>A similar trend is emerging among banks underwriting some Chinese bond offerings, bankers say, particularly in the case of state-owned corporations that have large pools of underwriters to choose from and tend to be stingier with fees.

Banks that agree to arrange bond offerings for ultralow fees are generally hoping to build relationships with corporate clients for future deals. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They are also hoping to generate revenue from related businesses, such as fees for setting up foreign-currency swaps or on bond-trading commissions.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">In some cases, local brokerages have been aggressively slashing fees to win bond underwriting mandates, leading issuers to demand global banks do the same, bankers say.

</span>Asian companies excluding Japan sold <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $334 billion</span> in U.S.-dollar bonds <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span></span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 60% from</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> according to Dealogic. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">More than half the bonds were issued by Chinese companies, which, in many cases, enjoyed strong investor demand for their debt.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">But market participants say global banks’ underwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn’t keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It is raising concerns that this core investment-banking business could become largely unprofitable in the fast-growing region.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Fee income from bonds in Asia has not grown proportionately to deal volumes,” said Clifford Lee, managing director and head of fixed income, treasury and markets at DBS Bank in Singapore.

</span>In the U.S., underwriting fees, in recent years, have averaged <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.7 percentage</span> point on investment-grade corporate bonds, meaning that for <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1 billion</span> bond issue, companies would pay <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $7 million</span> to banks arranging the sale. For U.S. high-yield, or “junk,” bonds, the fee <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averages 1.2 percentage</span> points, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Fees in Asia are generally lower and can vary widely, bankers say. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Chinese banks, including state-owned Bank of China Ltd. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., paid <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.1 percentage</span> point fee on recent bond sales, according to a person familiar with the matter.</span> Some companies are more generous. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $33 million</span> in fees—or <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.47 percentage</span> point—on <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $7 billion</span> investment-grade bond deal in November.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Some bankers who recently handled bond sales for Chinese companies said they have earned nothing from the deals in some instances.

</span>“We don’t like to do that but competition forces us to be on some deals no matter what,” said a Hong Kong-based banker for a Chinese bank, calling some of the fee practices “irrational.” He declined to name specific issuers.

Another factor contributing to lower fees: the rising number of banks participating on bond offerings. The average number of bookrunners on Chinese companies’ U.S.-dollar bond deals rose <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6.5 last</span> year, from an average <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.6 in</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> according to Dealogic. The average for Asia excluding Japan was <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">recently 4.6,</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">versus 2.2 in</span> the U.S.

Larger bond syndicates mean lower fees per deal are also being divided among more banks, making it harder for individual firms to profit, said Florian Schmidt, a former investment banker who now runs a consulting firm in Singapore.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Across Asia excluding Japan, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 170 banks</span> or brokerages were involved in arranging U.S.-dollar bond sales for issuers in the region <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span></span> more than triple the number five years earlier, according to Thomson Reuters.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Most of the newcomers were local financial companies and they included dozens of Chinese securities firms.

</span>When China <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sold $2 billion</span> in U.S.-dollar sovereign bonds in late October, it <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">tapped 10 investment</span> banks to handle the global sale to investors in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The country paid the banks, which included Chinese, U.S. and European banks, a total fee <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2 million</span>, <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 0.1 percentage</span> point. That suggests each bank <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earned $200,000 on</span> the sale.

Another reason many banks will swallow low fees is to move up the so-called league tables, which rank banks based on their deal volumes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">They are followed closely and touted by many banks, and those that do the most business tend to be more sought after by corporate clients.

</span>“The pressure to be higher up on the league table rankings becomes so much that investment banks start undercutting themselves by quoting absurdly low fees,” said Dharmesh Ojha, a former investment banker who is now chief investment officer of ITI Reinsurance in Mumbai.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In India, at least one of the three state-owned corporations that recently paid <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">banks $1 to</span> underwrite their bond deals said there was no reason to pay more, because banks were eager to win the business.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The companies—Indian Railway Finance Corp., Rural Electrification Corp. and Power Finance Corp.—each issued hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">An official from New Delhi-based Power Finance, the country’s largest state-owned and nonbank finance company, said it had invited banks to submit competitive bids to arrange <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $400 million</span> 10-year bond sale in late November.</span> Units of Barclays, Standard Chartered, and the investment banking arm of the State Bank of India arranged the sale. “The mandate was given to the lowest quoted fee,” the official said.

Canada’s Strong Words on Climate Face a Test in Trump’s Nafta Makeover

WASHINGTON — <span id=""0"" class=""red"">As President Trump demanded a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the past year, Canada staked out a position squarely at odds with the White House:</span> Any new pact must recognize climate change.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">That demand is now facing a test.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The United States and Mexico, the other two parties to the three-nation trade deal, in recent days have hammered out a possible revision of the pact, and Mr. Trump is urging Canada to sign on or be hit with automobile tariffs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The revised terms don’t mention climate change, according to the scant details made public Monday, and the Trump administration has long dismissed the science that shows global warming poses a serious threat to people and economies.
</span>Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, was in Washington on Tuesday to continue negotiations. Her government so far has given little indication of its intentions beyond a statement by Ms. Freeland’s spokesman, Adam Austen, who said the priority was that any deal be “good for the middle class.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Canada’s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement.
</span>In France, the environment minister quit during a live radio interview on Tuesday, saying the nation wasn’t doing enough on green issues. And last week in Australia, the prime minister was unseated by a challenger with strong coal-industry connections. Canada, much like Australia, has a powerful energy industry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a challenge from politicians aligned with the oil industry there. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, also has vowed to fight Mr. Trudeau’s plan to put a price on carbon emission in Canada when it takes effect next year.
</span>For reasons like these, Canadian environmental activists and United States foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government would have to pick and choose its priorities in the tense coming days, and many say climate change most likely will not make the cut. The Trump administration has opposed any mention of the phrase.
“I don’t think that’s going to happen at this point,” said George David Banks, former international energy and environment adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Banks said neither the Trump administration nor Mexico appeared interested in pursuing climate change in Nafta.
Mr. Trump has said if a compromise cannot be negotiated with Canada he will cut the country out of the deal. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It’s not at all clear, though, that Congress — which must sign off on any trade deal before it takes effect — would accept that.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">For Canada the risks are both economic and political.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, American exports to Canada have <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 165 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1993,</span> the year before Nafta came into force, and imports from Canada <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 150 percent</span>.</span> If Mr. Trudeau is unable to strike a deal with Mr. Trump he could come off looking weak in the eyes of his public. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But if Mr. Trump imposes <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 25 percent</span> tariff on automobiles it would hit hard the economic powerhouse province of Ontario.
</span>The absence of climate change language wouldn’t have an immediate effect on the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions projections from Canada, the United States or Mexico. After all, the current agreement also makes no mention of the need to drive down global warming.
But environmentalists say that failing to incorporate a mention would be a missed opportunity to make a statement in support of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 Paris</span> Agreement, which calls on <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 200 nations</span> to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and which did not exist when Nafta was drafted.
“It violates the norm that the environment belongs at the negotiating table,” said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“We seem to be pushing our trading partners to say, ‘It’s prosperity or the environment.</span> It’s prosperity or human rights,’” he said, arguing that it shouldn’t be thought of as an either-or.
Canada, for its part, has made climate change a centerpiece of its international agenda. It features prominently in the title, for example, of upcoming discussions at the Group <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 energy</span> discussions slated for Nova Scotia in September.
But the Canadian government also has sought out ways to avoid isolating the Trump administration by bringing less antagonizing issues, for instance cleaning plastic from the oceans, to the table.
When it comes to Nafta, the Trudeau government has taken a similarly pliable position. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">In August, Ms. Freeland outlined Canada’s vision for what it called “progressive elements” to any new trilateral trade deal.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The priorities: strengthening labor safeguards and incorporating new chapters on gender equality, indigenous rights and climate change.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">On climate, Mr. Trudeau maintained that he wanted to see the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to move to a low-carbon economy to be written into the new Nafta.
</span>“We are certainly looking for a better level playing field across North America on environmental protections,” Mr. Trudeau said last year.
Shortly after that remark, the Canadian foreign affairs minister sent the Trump administration a proposed chapter that included those elements but did not require the United States to accept or embrace the Paris Agreement.
However, late last year the Trump administration declined to accept that language, according to Mr. Banks and a Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request to discuss the role of that agenda in this week’s talks.
</span>“The big question will be to what extent Canada will be interested in going to the wall on climate,” said Dale Marshall, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, a Canadian nonprofit group. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“When the rubber hits the road and we’re talking about economic trade, does Canada feel strong enough about those issues to be willing to scuttle a deal?</span> I’m not sure,” he said.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Joshua C. Zive, a trade lobbyist who works with energy and utility companies for the firm Bracewell in Washington, said he did not think pushing climate change this week would be in Canada’s negotiating interest.</span> Already, he said, the Trump administration is intent on casting Mr. Trudeau as the scapegoat if a deal falls through.
“It’s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,” Mr. Zive said. “If it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Mr. Zive for his part questioned the need to incorporate climate change into Nafta, and said the trade deal had always been a fairly technical way to deal with specific products like automobiles.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">If negotiators push for a mention of climate change “just for symbolic purposes, you’re also importing the symbolic controversy,” he said.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“There is no need to force people to resolve this in an already-complicated and high-stakes trade dispute.”
Mr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration.
</span>“As the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States’ competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,” he said.

Updated <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 24,</span></span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 3</span>:11 am ET

The euro, French government bonds and European stocks jumped sharply in the wake of the first round of France’s presidential election, with centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron edging out far-right politician Marine Le Pen

Europe’s common currency rose as much <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1.9% to</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1.0935,</span> its highest level against the dollar since November.</span> Against the Japanese yen, the euro surged as <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">high 120.82,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.3%.</span> Gains moderated in recent action, with the euro <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.2% against</span> the dollar <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.1% against</span> the yen.

Traders drove down the spread between French and German government bonds, which had widened during the presidential campaign. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The 10-year French bond <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">yielded 0.76% in</span> early trading Monday, a spread <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.42 percentage</span> point above benchmark German debt.</span> The spread <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.64 percentage</span> point on Friday.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the French CAC-40 stock market index <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 3.8% in</span> the early minutes of European trade, driving the broader</span> Stoxx <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 600 up</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.5%.</span> Across Europe, gains in equities were led by banks, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.5%,</span> a sign that investors are again eager to bet on risk.

Many euro traders—and holders of European assets—had been concerned by the prospect of a strong showing by Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, or by the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Ms. Le Pen wants France out of the currency union, and Mr. Mélenchon has advocated scrapping some of its core fiscal rules.</span> Both positions, especially Ms. Le Pen’s, would spell trouble for the euro and for French government bonds.

Mr. Macron won the first round <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 23.9% of</span> the vote, followed by Ms. Le Pen <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 21.4%,</span> according to an official tally <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 96% of</span> the votes, meaning the pair will head into the second round on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 7.</span> Opinion polls published Sunday suggested Mr. Macron would beat Ms. Le Pen.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“This is the most market-friendly outcome,” said Vincent Juvyns, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</span> “A Macron-Le Pen contest in the second round should give Macron a significant majority.”

Conservative François Fillon placed third <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 19.9% of</span> the vote and threw his support behind Mr. Macron. Mr. Mélenchon <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">scored 19.5% of</span> the vote and refused to support one of the top two finishers as of Sunday evening.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Macron’s flagship economic policies are generally friendly to financial markets.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They include corporate tax cuts and an additional €50 billion ($54.5 billion) program of public investment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">During his time as economy minister <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2014 to</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> France put in place the so-called Macron Law to make it easier for employers to lay off workers.

</span>The difference between yields on sovereign bonds issued by France and Germany had widened in recent months ahead of the vote, an indication that traders saw an enhanced—if still tiny—chance that France defaults on its obligations. Other major nations borrow in currencies that they can print; eurozone countries don’t. The tightened spread Monday indicated that traders think that risk has abated.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Elsewhere in market action, gold futures <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">declined 0.9% to</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1276.40 a</span> troy ounce.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.3%.</span>

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Macron’s leading position may also give some space for the European Central Bank, which has continued with negative interest rates and large bond purchases, to back off those stimulative policies.

</span>Political risks, particularly around the French election, have been a major concern for markets this year. Some analysts and investors believe that the result of the first round may be a trigger for an increased appetite for European assets.

“International investors have been burned a bit in the past few years, so they’ve been reticent to get involved,” said Kevin O’Nolan, portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “But the perception that the center, the establishment is reasserting itself is good for investors.”

Fund managers had already begun to shift toward Europe, with inflows into the region’s equity markets picking up, according to data provider EPFR Global.

“After the Dutch election, we’ve already seen a shift in risk sentiment in terms of the attitude to European equities,” said Monica Defend, head of global asset allocation research at Pioneer Investments. (A mainstream center-right party prevailed over an anti-immigrant firebrand in last month’s Dutch election.)

Investors have been more cautious about the French election following the surprise results of last year’s U.K. referendum on EU membership, and the U.S. presidential election. Sunday’s first round may tamp down some uncertainty.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The most important thing is that it shows the polls are reliable, and that should increase the confidence in the second round results,” said Anais Boussie, economist at Credit Suisse.

</span>“You should see Le Pen defeated by <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 or</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 points</span>—with Brexit and Trump you had a gap of more like five points,” she added.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">France’s latest economic data has exceeded expectations, with business surveys hinting at the fastest expansion in nearly six years.</span> IHS Markit’s purchasing managers index for March <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 57.1</span>; anything <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 50 points</span> to growth.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">“European economic data has been better, stocks are cheaper, and it looked like there could be some sort of relief rally” after the French election, said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 8</span>:00 am ET

U.S. stocks’</span> September assault on record levels is prompting many investors to shift toward assets that have lagged behind in recent years, the latest bet that value strategies will regain favor.

Assets under management for one of the biggest value-focused exchange-traded funds tracked by FactSet hit a <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $50.3 billion</span> in September. The ETF has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">advanced 5.1% over</span> the past month.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Value stocks, often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth, saw the largest divergence in performance from their growth-focused counterparts this decade, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study that looked at the first half of September.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors have pared positions in technology stocks, Treasurys and other assets that have generated big returns in recent years.

</span>Funds tracking momentum stocks, those that investors are purchasing because they have been rising, recorded last week their first significant outflows since March of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And one of the biggest momentum-focused ETFs has edged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.4% over</span> the past month, underperforming the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> which has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 4.2%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves are the latest sign of how a jumble of contradictory data has investors grappling with two divergent paths for the U.S. economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A recovery from a soft patch in growth would, in theory, boost companies such as financials and energy companies, whose shares have underperformed broader markets over the years.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But an economy weakened by protracted trade conflicts and slowing growth abroad would likely push the Federal Reserve to further ease monetary policy, providing a tailwind for Treasurys and growth stocks.

</span>Many investors are opting for a nuanced approach. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Hugo Rogers, who <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $5 billion</span> as chief investment strategist at Deltec International Group, said his fund this month trimmed positions in Treasurys and gold and picked up shares of oil drillers, including Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. Shares of the S&P 500’s energy sector have zipped past the broader index in the past month, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gaining 8.5%.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We are trading what we think are the early stages of a reversal, and watching out for a bigger reversal that can last for many years,” he said.

</span>A confluence of factors is driving the most recent shift. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many are worried that the world’s biggest central banks are unlikely to loosen monetary policy much further.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Rates in Europe and Japan are already at or near historic lows, while the Fed has signaled that its latest rate cuts are unlikely to be followed by a long easing cycle.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That could spell bad news for the big, momentum-driven technology stocks, which have been a key engine for the market’s gains in recent years.</span> Some of the largest tech stocks have lost steam. Netflix Inc., for instance, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 44% year</span>-to-date through early May before giving up all of its gains and stumbling into the red for the first time on a year-to-date basis since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2016.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some of these companies underperformed the broader market Tuesday, with Facebook Inc., Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. dropping at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 2% as</span> the S&<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 shed</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.8%.</span>

</span>Momentum stocks haven’t been as widely held as they are now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016,</span> according to Wolfe Research, as investors large and small have piled into winners. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The firm analyzes bearish interest in different sectors to gauge sentiment.

</span>The high concentration of bets in a comparatively small universe of names has sparked fears of a potentially chaotic unwind, especially because many investors have used leverage to increase their exposure, analysts at JPMorgan warned. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That could lead to the type of jarring adjustments markets experienced in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> when a surge of volatility wrong-footed scores of investors caught wagering that share-price swings would remain muted, said Marko Kolanovic, a quantitative and derivatives strategist at the firm.

</span>Momentum trades “worked well until the rotation started, and now are in the early stages of a collapse,” Mr. Kolanovic wrote on Sept.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span>

Still, plenty of investors are reluctant to part with assets that have been winners for years and sink money into those that have consistently underperformed during the current expansion. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many who have scooped up value stocks in recent weeks have retained large positions in Treasurys and technology stocks.

</span>“It’s going to take quite a while to have value regain its normal standing in the marketplace,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management. “It’s not as easy as just doing this dash for trash.”

DAMASCUS—When Syrian businessman Mohammed Jaber held a dinner at a luxury hotel here for his associates recently, there was little doubt where they stood on the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad.

""Bashar, we are your soldiers in the millions, no matter what,"" they chanted as toasts were exchanged.

A woman visiting from Lebanon singled out Syrian army officers in the party. ""You are the embodiment of honor and dignity, and the dirt on your boots is a crown on our heads,"" she said.

Mr. Assad's regime has defied myriad predictions of its imminent demise, and lately has taken the offensive against the rebels in the more than two-year-old uprising. In coordination with Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Mr. Assad's forces this week launched a sweeping military campaign to retake Qusayr, a western town crucial to securing roads to Lebanon and Syria's regime-controlled Mediterranean coast.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, regime forces pressed ahead on multiple fronts against besieged opposition enclaves in Damascus suburbs where the government has succeeded since April in cutting off rebel supply lines.

</span>A critical reason for the regime's resilience—in addition to military help from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah—is that Mr. Assad can count on a circle of Syrian businessmen like Mr. Jaber deeply committed to the Assad government. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Together, they help it weather the devastating impact of war and international economic sanctions.

</span>Mr. Jaber's focus is energy. Syrian oil and gas production has fallen to a fraction of its level two years ago. Though Iran and Iraq provide supplies, chaotic conditions and rebel sabotage have crippled the ability to move oil products around Syria by pipeline or rail. Mr. Jaber has stepped in to organize tanker-truck convoys and provide them with armed escorts.

Crude oil shipped in from Iran to Syria's west coast is refined at plants not far from Qusayr, where fighters from the government and Hezbollah are battling rebels.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">For their support of the regime, Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have been sanctioned by the European Union, the Arab League and the U.S. Treasury Department, and are subject to a travel ban.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Treasury has accused them of helping Mr. Assad's brother Maher, who is a senior military commander, and other security forces to organize, finance and arm the Shabiha—groups of militants the opposition says are participants in the regime's brutality against foes.

</span>In an interview, Mr. Jaber denied being an associate of Maher al-Assad—but he spoke warmly of the Shabiha militants.

Mr. Jaber proudly took responsibility for organizing protests that disrupted an opposition conference in Turkey in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011 and</span> for mobilizing an attack that vandalized the American embassy in Damascus the next month.

""If Shabiha refers to those defending their homeland, then it's a medal of honor,"" he said.

Ayman Jaber couldn't be reached to comment. Maher al-Assad doesn't speak to the media.

In normal times, Mr. Jaber's task of fuel transport would largely be handled by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, housed in a complex in a Damascus suburb called Dummar. At the complex, large maps of oil fields, pipelines and infrastructure greet visitors in the lobby.

Inside, on a recent day, a senior official tallied his industry's losses. Before the uprising began in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2011,</span> he said, Syria produced <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 380,000 barrels</span> of oil and more than a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. Production is down to <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 50,000 barrels</span> of oil <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 565 million</span> cubic feet of gas, he said.

Most of the country's largest oil fields, in the northeastern and eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour, Hasakah and Raqqa, are ""temporarily"" under the control of rebels and antigovernment militias, according to the official. He said the rebel groups use rudimentary methods to steal and refine crude oil and have set nine wells on fire.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">More <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 75 oil</span>-industry employees have been killed <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 100 kidnapped</span> in the area since the start of the war, the official said.

</span>A pipeline for moving light crude oil from the oil fields to terminals and refineries in western Syria is shut down, and one for heavy crude is attacked regularly, the official said. Pipelines for shipping refined products to the capital in central Syria and the north are out of service.

Mr. Jaber specializes in overcoming such logistical challenges. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Referring to the likes of Mr. Jaber, the ministry official said, ""Even if you want the Statue of Liberty, there are those who can bring it for you at the right price.</span>""

Although the Assad regime has at times received oil from Russia and Venezuela, the bulk of it now comes from Iran and Iraq. Mr. Jaber estimated that nearly two million barrels of crude oil arrive by ship from Iran each week at the Syrian port of Latakia on the Mediterranean, to be refined in Homs and Baniyas, the sites near the embattled city of Qusayr.

For nearly a year, Iraq has been providing Syria with fuel oil as part of a one-year, <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 800,000</span>-ton contract, according to Mr. Jaber and two Iraqi officials.

Mr. Jaber said he has taken the lead on the contract. Almost every month, he flies to Baghdad with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash on behalf of the government, he said—showing a slip for a recent million-dollar deposit in an Iraqi bank. Wire transfers aren't an option because of sanctions.

With Syrian government permission, Mr. Jaber said, he has trained and armed hundreds of gunmen to escort tanker trucks hauling oil products across Iraq to Syria, and then within Syria.

The nearly 500-mile journey from Iraq's oil installations is mostly through desert and is filled with perils. Two of the three Iraq-Syria border crossings lie in rebel-controlled areas and are closed. Groups linked to al Qaeda are active on both sides of the border.

Mr. Jaber said he and all those working with him, including truck drivers, receive daily threats from rebels, often in texts to their cellphones.

""We will turn every truck transporting fuel for this tyrant into an inferno for its owner,"" pledged one pro-Syrian rebel Iraqi group in leaflets distributed recently at the border.

Mr. Jaber's home in the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya was attacked in October. The entire apartment building was looted and then set on fire, according to neighborhood residents. Neither Mr. Jaber, who <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 57 years</span> old, nor members of his family were there. He said he has moved his wife and children to Moscow while he works out of a suite in a Damascus hotel.

Mr. Jaber was born in Latakia, a stronghold of the Shiite-linked Alawite sect that includes Mr. Assad and is a minority in Sunni-majority Syria. Many of the businessmen supporting the regime are Alawites, including Mr. Jaber. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, some Sunni businessmen have also stuck with the government, particularly in the Syrian economic capital of Aleppo, where they witnessed the looting of their factories by rebels.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Jaber and his brother Ayman have long been involved in trade and in Syria's steel industry.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He said he also has been importing fuel from Iraq for Syria's government <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> and he helped Iraq obtain diesel fuel during its war.</span> His experience and loyalty to Mr. Assad made him a natural for his current fuel-transport role, Mr. Jaber said.

""We are with the regime to the bone. If President Bashar asks for our blood, we would give it to him,"" he said.

Lately, Mr. Jaber has sought to diversify Syria's energy sources by organizing fuel convoys from Lebanon, whose border is only a few miles west of Damascus. Lebanese militants allied with Syria's rebels regularly attack the convoys.

Mr. Jaber shrugs off the attackers. ""They are mere riffraff,"" he said, boasting he has been able to operate under worse conditions.

Last July, on a day when the assassination of an Assad brother-in-law provoked clashes in the capital, Mr. Jaber said he succeeded in <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">delivering 1,200 tons</span> of fuel from the Iraqi border to the capital city's main power plant. This spring, he personally helped deliver an urgent fuel shipment to the Syrian province of Suwaida, south of Damascus, which could be reached only by traversing a zone where rebels and government forces have been fighting for months.

Mr. Jaber revels in recounting an incident in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2011 when</span> U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Ford left the capital to visit protesters in the central city of Hama. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Jaber said he told Emad Ghreiwati, an industrialist whose brother Issam heads the Syrian American Business Council, to let the ambassador know he <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 24 hours</span> to ""apologize to the Syrian people because he breached diplomatic norms"" or see the U.S. embassy besieged by loyalists.

</span>Mr. Jaber said he and dozens of members of pro-regime paramilitary groups later broke into the embassy, smashed windows, attacked offices and burned the U.S. flag, before Syrian security forces intervened.

Mr. Ford left the country four months later because of what a State Department official called ""threats against his personal safety in Syria."" In <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2012 the</span> U.S. suspended its representation in Damascus and later expelled Syria's ambassador to Washington.

Mr. Ford didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Issam Ghreiwati declined to be interviewed, and efforts to reach his brother were unsuccessful.

Mr. Jaber said Syria's president faces the same ""conspiracy"" that his late father Hafez al-Assad, founder of the regime, tackled in the 1980s when he battled Islamist insurgents and militants linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Tears streamed down Mr. Jaber's cheeks as he played an audio on his cellphone of a speech by the late president railing against the Sunni Islamist scourge.

As for the current struggle, Mr. Jaber said the real war hasn't started yet, adding that he is ready to <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">mobilize 100,000 men</span> in his native Latakia if the regime asks him to. ""If the entire world stands against us, we won't abandon Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad,"" he said.
