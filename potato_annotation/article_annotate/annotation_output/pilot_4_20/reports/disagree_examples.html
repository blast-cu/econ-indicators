This is especially true if they had no assets that would be at risk if an emergency caused them to be treated without insurance at a hospital.<br>“What [the architects of the law] didn’t account for was the behavior of the target population,” he said.<br>For now, Republican congressional efforts to further dismantle the law – beyond their mauling of the mandate – are dead in the water for at least the next two years, with Democrats taking back the House.<br>But ObamaCare now faces a new legal threat, following a federal court ruling this month declaring the health care law unconstitutional – and creating a new element of uncertainty.<br>OBAMACARE COULD RETURN TO SUPREME COURT<br>That legal dispute is tied to the mandate penalty’s elimination.<br>Back <span id="12" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 2012,</span> the Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare’s individual mandate, ruling that the government could require the purchase of health insurance under its taxing power. But in his recent opinion, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that because the mandate penalty was eliminated, the rest of the law is invalid.<br>“The remainder of the ACA is non-severable from the individual mandate, meaning that the Act must be invalidated in whole,” O’Connor wrote.<br>The Affordable Care Act remains in place pending appeal as the law’s defenders vow to preserve it. Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi blasted the ruling as “absurd.” The case eventually could come before the Supreme Court.<br>Josh Blackman, a South Texas College of Law Houston professor who has written two books on ObamaCare, said the judiciary must look at what the lawmakers who drafted the plan thought of the mandate.

And now, which country is looking to the United States? No one,” said Elisabeth Braw of the London-based Royal United Services Institute.<br>America’s disengagement on the coronavirus fight is part of a broader retreat from the world. <span id="2" class="red">From the Paris climate change accord to multiple trade agreements, the Trump administration has unwound decades of U.S. leadership on a range of issues.<br></span>But such is the severity of this crisis that America’s absence could permanently impact its standing, ceding ground to an ascendant China in the great game of global influence, analysts said.<br>“I do wonder whether this really is an inflection point in the international system,” said Nathalie Tocci, the head of the Italian Institute of International Affairs and a former foreign policy adviser to senior European Union leaders.<br>“Here in Italy it is going to change for good the perception of who is leading in the world, and it’s not the United States,” she said. “It’s so strong what is happening. It’s so powerful and it’s so traumatic. The emotions that it ignites today are going to be engraved in the national narrative.”<br>There’s an element of opportunism in some of the gestures by the United States’ rivals. Huawei, the Chinese technology giant accused by the United States of acting as a branch of China’s intelligence agencies, has seized the opportunity to promote its brand to stricken Europeans at a time when their governments are weighing whether to adopt its high-speed 5G cellular network, despite US requests not to do so.<br>The company has delivered thousands of masks and other equipment bearing the Huawei logo to hard-hit countries, which may help win support for its 5G network once the crisis subsides.<br>“China is sending medical supplies, but it is it a good Samaritan or is it simply doing it to exploit tensions in the Western alliance?” asked Braw. “It’s very opportunistic and it’s clear China senses a vacuum.<br>“But unless the Trump administration ups its game, this could be the moment in world history where the trend pivots in favor of China,” she added.<br>Russia has likewise sensed opportunity in the vacuum of American leadership, sending a cargo plane of medical aid to Italy earlier this week. But Italian officials told Italian media that the offer was unsolicited and the equipment and medicine sent didn’t match Italy’s needs.<br>U.S. officials say they have offered assistance. U.S. troops based in Italy helped send and deliver hospital beds, mattresses, stretchers and other equipment to the Italian province of Lombardy, the ground zero of Italy’s coronavirus crisis.<br>In late January, when China’s outbreak was at its peak, the U.S. government said it was sending more <span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">than 17 tons</span> of medical equipment there. In early February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">additional $100 million</span> in assistance “to China.”<br>The State Department modified that in later statements, saying the aid would go to high-risk and developing countries, with no mention of China. A Chinese official last week said that China had received “not $1” from the United States.<br>Some of <span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">the $100 million</span> has been committed to the World Health Organization and other multilateral institutions, said Pooja Jhunjhunwala, acting spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development.<br>The agency has <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">designated 25 countries</span> to receive direct assistance, most of them in Central and Southeast Asia.

It is our resources, our expertise, our technical capacity and our standing in the world that allows us to do that. I fear that’s not happening today.”<br>Both Russia and China have also been promoting disinformation about the coronavirus, countering the language of top American officials such as Trump and Pompeo that the coronavirus is a Chinese virus by advancing conspiracy theories, such as that the pathogen may have been developed in American laboratories, said Braw.

Struggling to respond to precipitous declines on China’s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country’s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, in a bid to stabilize the markets.<br></span>The government-controlled Securities Association of China said <span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id="1" class="red">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.<br></span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id="2" class="red">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.<br></span><span id="3" class="red">“If it’s <span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it’s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,” said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China’s fifth-largest bank.<br></span><span id="4" class="red">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id="5" class="red">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="10" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="19" class="yellow"

on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.<br></span><span id="6" class="red">The design of the brokerage industry’s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id="7" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id="7" class="red">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government’s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id="8" class="red">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.<br></span><span id="9" class="red">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id="10" class="red">“Excessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,” the statement said, “and as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.”<br></span><span id="11" class="red">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China’s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.<br><span id="12" class="red">But the design of the securities industry’s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id="13" class="red">Shares in large companies represent only <span id="8" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.<br></span><span id="14" class="red">As Chinese stocks soared in <span id="9" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">the 12 months</span> until their peak on <span

12,</span></span></span> it was the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals that fared the best.</span> Many of them quadrupled, or more, in value, while the overall index only doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.<br>The small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. <span id="15" class="red">The Shanghai market <span id="11" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">soared 149 percent</span> in the year until <span id="12" class="yellow"

mainland Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong — and many of them in Shanghai as well — rose <span id="14" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">only 24 percent</span> over the same period.<br></span><span id="17" class="red">Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money.</span> <span id="18" class="red">Official statistics suggest that loans to investors for stock purchases climbed ninefold in mainland China over the past two years, and were supplemented by widespread lending by informal financial companies at annual interest rates <span id="15" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">exceeding 20 percent</span>.<br></span>The bailout funds could also end up helping big state-owned enterprises at the expense of smaller businesses, which tend to be in the private sector. <span id="19" class="red">President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have spoken of their desire to increase the role of the private sector as a way to improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy.<br></span><span id="20" class="red">Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets — the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.<br></span><span id="21" class="red">Hours after the securities industry’s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives <span id="16" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">from 25 mutual</span> fund companies, who announced plans to help shore up the stock market by speeding up the issuance of funds investing in

Nowhere was there a mention of Mr. Trump’s threats to pull out of the agreement. <span id="8" class="red">But the letter, signed by Stephen Vaughn, the acting United States trade representative, did say, “The persistent U.S. deficit in goods trade with Canada and Mexico demands that this administration take swift action to revise the relationship to reflect and respond to 21st century challenges.”<br></span><span id="9" class="red">Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a former Mexican trade official, said the letter suggested a softening in tone but also contained several proposals that were likely to prompt a strong response from the Mexican government.<br></span>“There are some specific problems,” said Mr. Ortiz-Mena, now a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington. “But in terms of the language used during the campaign and at the beginning of the administration, it’s not as far-reaching as some people could have expected.”<br>The assessment that the actual policies of the United States might not end up being as harsh as those espoused by Mr. Trump during the campaign is reflected in the confidence in the Mexican peso. <span id="10" class="red">Since the inauguration, measured against a basket of currencies, it has gained <span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">about 17.5 percent</span> in value, more than any other major currency in the world.</span> On Thursday, it traded <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">at 18.72 pesos</span> to the dollar, approaching the levels it held before Mr. Trump’s victory.<br>The Canadian government declined on Thursday to comment directly on the draft proposals, since Nafta negotiations have not begun. “Should notice of intent to renegotiate be given, Canada is prepared to discuss improvements at the appropriate time,” said Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry.<br><span id="11" class="red">Among Canadian trade experts, the proposals were met with relief, but the suspense has not ended.</span> While the draft does not amount to a total dismissal of Nafta, it outlines American priorities that could threaten Canadian industries. <span id="12" class="red">“It’s not ripping Nafta, but there are a bunch of sticks of dynamite contained in those pages,” said Mark Warner, a Canadian-American trade lawyer based in Toronto.</span> “It’s going to be a messy, hard-slogging negotiation.”<br><span id="13" class="red">The letter calls for expanding market access among the three countries and eliminating licensing and permit barriers that tend to stall commerce.</span> It also calls for maintaining “reciprocal access” for textile and apparel products.<br><span id="14" class="red">Rather than scrap Nafta’s arbitration tribunals, regarded by some free-trade critics as secretive bodies that give private corporations unbridled power to challenge foreign governments outside the court system, the letter proposes to “maintain and seek to improve procedures” for settling disputes.<br></span><span id="15" class="red">The draft also makes no mention of currency policy, an issue that many trade experts thought might be on the table.<br></span>The administration does give itself room to get tougher.

class="red">HONG KONG — Struggling to respond to precipitous declines on China’s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country’s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, in a bid to stabilize the markets.<br></span>The government-controlled Securities Association of China said <span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id="1" class="red">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.<br></span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id="2" class="red">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.<br></span><span id="3" class="red">“If it’s <span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it’s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,” said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China’s fifth-largest bank.<br></span><span id="4" class="red">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id="5" class="red">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="10" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="19" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">June 12,</span></span></span> erasing more <span id="6" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">than $2 trillion</span> of value and inflicting immediate hardship on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.<br></span><span id="6" class="red">The design of the brokerage industry’s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id="7" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id="7" class="red">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government’s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id="8" class="red">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.<br></span><span id="9" class="red">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id="10" class="red">“Excessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,” the statement said, “and as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.”<br></span><span id="11" class="red">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China’s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.<br><span id="12" class="red">But the design of the securities industry’s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id="13" class="red">Shares in large companies represent only <span id="8" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.<br></span><span id="14" class="red">As Chinese stocks soared in <span id="9" class="yellow"

id="19" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">June 12,</span></span></span> it was the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals that fared the best.</span> Many of them quadrupled, or more, in value, while the overall index only doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.<br>The small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. <span id="15" class="red">The Shanghai market <span id="11" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">soared 149 percent</span> in the year until <span id="12" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">June 12.</span></span> <span id="16" class="red">By comparison, a stock price index <span id="13" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">of 100 large</span> mainland Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong — and many of them in Shanghai as well — rose <span id="14" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">only 24 percent</span> over the same period.<br></span><span id="17" class="red">Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money.</span> <span id="18" class="red">Official statistics suggest that loans to investors for stock purchases climbed ninefold in mainland China over the past two years, and were supplemented by widespread lending by informal financial companies at annual interest rates <span id="15" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">exceeding 20 percent</span>.<br></span>The bailout funds could also end up helping big state-owned enterprises at the expense of smaller businesses, which tend to be in the private sector. <span id="19" class="red">President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have spoken of their desire to increase the role of the private sector as a way to improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy.<br></span><span id="20" class="red">Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets — the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.<br></span><span id="21" class="red">Hours after the securities industry’s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives <span id="16" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">from 25 mutual</span> fund companies, who announced plans to help shore up the stock market by speeding up the issuance of funds investing in equities.</span> <span id="22" class="red">But the association did not introduce its own market stabilization fund like the brokerage industry, contrary to initial reports on Chinese social media that it would do so.<br></span>Another worry lies in whether many Chinese mutual funds and other investment funds may be required to liquidate suddenly. Many of these funds have rules on losses in the underlying contracts that formed them: If the value of the fund <span id="17" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">falls 30 percent</span>, the fund must return the remaining money to shareholders, typically by cashing in all of its shares.<br><span id="23" class="red">With the Shanghai stock market <span id="18" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">down 28.6 percent</span> since <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="10" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="19" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">June 12,</span></span></span> that rule is starting to appear to be a possible risk to the broader market, Mr. Hong said.<br></span><span id="24" class="red"><span id="20" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">The 21 brokerages</span> said that they would not resume selling shares from their own portfolios until the Shanghai stock index returns <span id="21" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">to 4,500</span>; it closed on Friday <span id="22" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">at 3,686.915.</span><br></span><span id="25" class="red">But Tao Zhigang, an economist who is the director of the Institute for China and Global Development at Hong Kong University, said that setting a specific target <span id="23" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">like 4,500 ran</span> the risk that many investors may conclude the government will do whatever is necessary to push the market to that level.<br></span>That may prompt investors to borrow even more money on the conviction of a guaranteed return, he said.<br><br>PROLIFIC: <i>poor</i><br>HOUSE: <i>none</i><br><br><br><br><h3>Retail Sales Jump and Jobless Claims Drop in New Signs of Recovery: Live Updates</h3><br><span id="0" class="red"><br>Jobless claims fell last week to their lowest level of the pandemic, renewing confidence in a dynamic economic revival.<br></span><span id="1" class="red"><span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">About 613,000 people</span> filed first-time claims for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, a decrease <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">of 153,000 from</span> the previous week.<br></span><span id="2" class="red">In addition,<span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"> 132,000 filed</span> for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that covers freelancers, part-timers and others who do not routinely qualify for state benefits.</span> That was a decline <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">of 20,000 from</span> the previous week.<br>Neither figure is seasonally adjusted.<br><span id="3" class="red">In another sign of the recovery underway, <span id="8" class="red">Retail sales surged in March, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, as Americans spent their latest round of government stimulus checks and the continued roll out of coronavirus vaccines lured more people back into stores.<br></span></span><span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="7" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">The 9.8 percent</span></span> increase last month was a strong comeback from the <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="8" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">nearly 3 percent</span></span> drop in February.<br><span id="4" class="red">With the pandemic’s end seemingly in sight, the economy is poised for a robust comeback.</span> <span id="5" class="red">But weekly applications for unemployment claims have remained stubbornly high for months, frustrating the recovery even as businesses reopen and vaccination rates increase.<br></span><span id="6" class="red">“The job market conditions for job seekers have really improved extremely quickly between January and now,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the job site ZipRecruiter.</span> “But there are still huge barriers to returning to work.”<br><span id="7" class="red">Jobless claims for the next few months could remain much higher than they were before the pandemic as the labor market adjusts to a new normal.<br></span>Concerns about workplace safety persist, especially for workers who are not yet vaccinated.

helpful to know how many people are actually getting them,” said Elizabeth Pancotti, a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research.</span> <span id="5" class="red">While the Labor Department reports may be the best source of information, she said, they offer an “incomplete picture.”<br>Shelter-in-place orders and business restrictions have been lifting across the country, and there is evidence in the report that some workers are being called back: The number of people receiving state jobless benefits dropped by <span id="17" class="yellow"

Initially, many people were mistakenly told they were ineligible. Others were instructed to apply for state benefits first and be rejected before applying for the federal benefits.<br>That confused application process has caused potentially millions of laid-off workers to be counted twice. States are also weeding out duplicate applications from frustrated filers who had trouble getting through or did not receive any response after weeks of waiting.<br>Then there are the mistakes. A data entry slip-up caused Massachusetts to pump up the number of federal claims by nearly a million last week. The previous week, a similar flub in Connecticut mistakenly inflated its total by a quarter of a million.<br><span id="12" class="red">“It’s unclear if states are including duplicate claims due to error, fraud or the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist at Evercore ISI in Washington.<br></span>But that is not all.
