If Democrats win a majority in either chamber of Congress, the law would be protected; a GOP sweep could further embolden repeal attempts.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s right on the balance there,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis. \u201cThe viability of the program is heavily dependent on the outcome of the election, not the changes in between.\u201d<br><br>With recent polls showing health care remains a top concern among voters, both major political parties have an incentive to wield it as an election issue. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Democrats are likely to argue that the GOP wants to take coverage away from millions of Americans, with Republicans focusing on escalating insurance prices.<br><br></span>What happens in the interim, health policy analysts say, depends on how events play out in three arenas \u2014 Capitol Hill, the White House and the insurance industry.<br><br>After a year of full GOP control, congressional Republicans and the White House have damaged the ACA but fallen short of their vehement goal of dismantling broad swaths of it. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More ambiguous is whether their end-of-year victory \u2014 removing tax penalties starting <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 for</span> people who violate the insurance mandate \u2014 will whet the GOP\u2019s appetite for taking apart more of the law.<br><br></span>\u201cTo those who believe \u2014 including Senate Republican leadership \u2014 that <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>there</span> will not be another effort to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 well you are sadly mistaken,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted last week.<br><br>Graham\u2019s vow was a rejoinder to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested in an NPR interview that \u201cwe\u2019ll probably move on to other issues.\u201d He also noted that the chamber\u2019s slender GOP majority will shrink to one senator once the Democratic winner of a special election in Alabama is sworn in next month.<br><br><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">McConnell reiterated his intention to try to coax the Senate early in the year to adopt two measures, promised to a crucial Senate Republican moderate in exchange for her support of the massive tax overhaul enacted last week, that would help cushion ACA insurance marketplaces.<br><br></span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One bill would restore for two years the payments that the law guarantees insurers \u2014 estimated <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8 billion</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>\u2014 to reimburse them for discounts that ACA health plans must give lower-income customers for deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.</span> President Trump cut off the payments in October.<br><br>The other bill would provide <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $10 billion</span> over two years to help states create high-risk pools or otherwise help insurers cope with customers with especially high medical costs. House conservatives fiercely opposed both measures.<br><br>Meanwhile, the administration is pressing forward with at least one more jab at the ACA marketplaces. As directed by an executive order that President Trump signed this fall, officials are finishing a draft rule to make it easier for insurers to sell meager but inexpensive health plans that skirt the law\u2019s coverage requirements.<br><br>The ground-level effect of such changes for consumers rests in large part on how the insurance industry responds. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Without the measure to help stabilize the law\u2019s marketplaces and with greater availability of skimpy health plans, \u201cwe risk the individual market on the exchanges becoming a de facto high-risk pool,\u201d said one industry official not authorized to speak on the record.</span> That means premiums would soar, causing those exchanges to shrink and become the province of sick, expensive customers.<br><br>On the other hand, said Joseph Antos, a health-care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, more expensive premiums could \u201cmove in the opposite direction of knocking down the ACA\u201d because the law\u2019s premium subsidies would rise to keep pace. For the more <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 percent</span> of ACA customers who qualify for those subsidies, he said, more generous subsidies could make it easier to afford higher tiers of coverage, motivating more people to sign up.<br><br>Such hard-to-predict boomerang effects could be true of the insurance mandate as well. The requirement has always been the least popular part of the law. So at a time when the most recent polls show that slightly more than half the public regards the ACA favorably, removing the most objectionable feature \u201ccould even be a blessing in disguise\u201d for supporters, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.<br><br><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Trump sought last week to equate the part of the tax legislation that undermines the individual mandate with repeal of the entire law.</span> His assertion at a Cabinet meeting was a pronounced overstatement. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Other central features of the ACA remain intact \u2014 including its insurance marketplaces, intended for Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job; the expansion of Medicaid in more <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 states</span> plus the District of Columbia; and the premium subsidies.<br><br></span>In fact, health-policy analysts say ending the penalties for violating the mandate will be a real-world test of a debate that has simmered for years: whether a legal requirement to be insured motivates people to get coverage, or whether the ACA\u2019s subsidies are a stronger incentive.<br><br><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">According to the most recent federal figures,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.7 million</span> Americans who flouted the requirement paid a total of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3 billion</span> in tax penalties <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Ending the penalties will cause an <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional 4 million</span> people to be uninsured <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 and</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13 million</span> within a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</span> Insurance premiums in the ACA marketplaces will rise an <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra 10 percent</span> in most of those years, the CBO estimates.<br><br>If this happens, it will feed the talking points of both political parties, Blendon, the Harvard professor, predicts. \u201cThe big-picture issues will be premiums increasing and dropping coverage,\u201d he said.<br><br>But for now, Antos says, the unexpectedly high number of people enrolling in ACA plans, in a year when insurance choices shrank, premium costs rose and the White House became a megaphone for criticism of the law, suggests that the law remains \u201cdurable.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see big lurches in either direction for both political and practical reasons,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to move the ship once it\u2019s moving.\u201d<br><br>Read more:<br><br>Americans sprint to get Affordable Care Act coverage in last hours before deadline<br><br>Fifth year\u2019s ACA enrollment season opening with daunting obstacles", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Government revenue and expenses [articles focused on lawmaking and government action including treaties, regulation, taxes, laws, and spending]": "3"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}

class=\"red\">\u201cWhen we think about what to do when benefits expire, it would be helpful to know how many people are actually getting them,\u201d said Elizabeth Pancotti, a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">While the Labor Department reports may be the best source of information, she said, they offer an \u201cincomplete picture.\u201d<br><br>Shelter-in-place orders and business restrictions have been lifting across the country, and there is evidence in the report that some workers are being called back: The number of people receiving state jobless benefits dropped by <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 3.8 million</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 21.1 million</span> for the week ended <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 16.</span><br><br></span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But as Ms. Swonk noted, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to offset the extraordinary economic devastation and job losses associated with Covid-19.\u201d<br><br></span>And while rehiring certainly accounts for a chunk of that decline, workers who had exhausted their weekly state benefits would also be reflected.<br><br><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Reopenings remain bumpy and incomplete, and flare-ups of the coronavirus continue to disrupt business.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">On Tuesday, Ford Motor temporarily halted production at the Kansas City assembly plant in Missouri to deep clean after an employee tested positive for the virus.</span> Two other Ford plants \u2014 in Chicago and Dearborn, Mich. \u2014 were also temporarily closed.<br><br>In Thursday\u2019s report, the department offered two sets of figures.

Initially, many people were mistakenly told they were ineligible. Others were instructed to apply for state benefits first and be rejected before applying for the federal benefits.<br><br>That confused application process has caused potentially millions of laid-off workers to be counted twice. States are also weeding out duplicate applications from frustrated filers who had trouble getting through or did not receive any response after weeks of waiting.<br><br>Then there are the mistakes. A data entry slip-up caused Massachusetts to pump up the number of federal claims by nearly a million last week. The previous week, a similar flub in Connecticut mistakenly inflated its total by a quarter of a million.<br><br><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s unclear if states are including duplicate claims due to error, fraud or the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist at Evercore ISI in Washington.<br><br></span>But that is not all. That system is also probably missing millions of other laid-off workers.<br><br><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">As of Tuesday, three states had not put the pandemic unemployment insurance program into effect, and several others have yet to report any claims.</span> Thirteen states have not started another federal emergency relief program, to provide an <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional 13 weeks</span> of benefits to workers who have exhausted their state benefits.<br><br><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Laid-off workers who have not applied for benefits and those who have left the labor force entirely are not included in the claims numbers.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Nor are any of the eight million undocumented workers who lost their jobs.</span> They are not eligible for any benefits. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Neither are new graduates just entering the labor force.<br><br></span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Matthew Wilson,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> who lost his barista job in Philadelphia, was turned down because he had been working in the state for less than a year.<br><br></span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2014 I moved, and now I\u2019m magically not qualified for unemployment?\u201d said Mr. Wilson, who relocated to Pennsylvania after graduating from Tufts University in Massachusetts last year.</span> He appealed the decision and heard last week that his claim had been approved, but he hasn\u2019t received any money. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">His partner, who also lost her job as a barista, has applied four times but has yet to collect benefits.<br><br></span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">As for regular unemployment benefits, states draw up their own rules and administer benefits.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The result is that in some places, like Florida, Texas and Arizona, only a small fraction of jobless workers are receiving benefits, while other states offer much broader coverage.<br><br></span>The way \u201cinitial claims\u201d are counted may also vary by state, with some excluding claims that have not been processed.<br><br>Laurie Yadoff, a lawyer at Coast to Coast Legal Aid of South Florida, said she had <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 100 clients</span> who qualify for regular state benefits but have had trouble filing.

{"id": "1263", "displayed_text": "<h1>Fund in China Aims to Stabilize Stock Markets</h1><br><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">HONG KONG \u2014 Struggling to respond to precipitous declines on China\u2019s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country\u2019s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, in a bid to stabilize the markets.<br><br></span>The government-controlled Securities Association of China said <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.<br><br></span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.<br><br></span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf it\u2019s <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it\u2019s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China\u2019s fifth-largest bank.<br><br></span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> erasing more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $2 trillion</span> of value and inflicting immediate hardship on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.<br><br></span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The design of the brokerage industry\u2019s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government\u2019s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.<br><br></span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cExcessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.\u201d<br><br></span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China\u2019s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.<br><br><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But the design of the securities industry\u2019s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Shares in large companies represent only <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.<br><br></span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">As Chinese

id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 12,</span></span></span> it was the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals that fared the best.</span> Many of them quadrupled, or more, in value, while the overall index only doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.<br><br>The small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Shanghai market <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">soared 149 percent</span> in the year until <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June

by informal financial companies at annual interest rates <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 20 percent</span>.<br><br></span>The bailout funds could also end

<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $40 a</span> barrel, providing modest relief for the industry after U.S. oil prices briefly turned negative for the first time ever in April.</span> But none of the world\u2019s largest oil companies now foresee a rapid recovery as countries continue to struggle with containing the coronavirus.<br><br><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said his company faced an uncertain future for energy demand and couldn\u2019t predict commodity prices with confidence right now.<br><br></span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe expect a choppy economy and a choppy market,\u201d Mr. Wirth said in an interview earlier in July.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all depends on the virus and the

and</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3%,</span> respectively, from a year ago, as the companies shut off wells to avoid selling into a weak market.</span> <span

id=\"14\" class=\"red\">While major stock indexes have recovered from April, when they fell to their lowest levels in years, oil and gas stocks have continued to lag despite the slight rebound in commodity prices.<br><br></span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Many of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, including Exxon and Chevron, have for years used an integrated business model, which has historically allowed them to weather most market conditions.<br><br></span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">By owning oil and gas wells, along with the downstream plants to manufacture refined products like gasoline and chemicals, the companies were long able to capitalize in one sector of their business, regardless of whether oil prices were high or low.<br><br></span>But that model has failed to deliver strong returns for most of the past decade, as the world has faced a glut of fossil fuels triggered in part by America\u2019s fracking boom, and it isn\u2019t protecting the companies now, according to Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson.<br><br>\u201cA broad-based reassessment of the capital-management programs at the big oils is required at this point,\u201d Mr. Terreson said.<br><br><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Oil companies have been forced to take dramatic action to shore up their finances in recent months, including cutting tens of billions of dollars from their budgets and laying off thousands of employees.<br><br></span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Exxon, which had previously disclosed <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 30% cut</span> to capital expenditures <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020,</span> said on Friday it has \u201cidentified significant potential for additional reductions\u201d and said capital spending <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021 will</span> be lower than this year\u2019s spending.<br><br></span>Its steepest cuts have been to U.S. shale drilling, particularly in the Permian Basin, the most active U.S. oil field, where it removed half of its drilling rigs and will cut half of the <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">remaining 30 rigs</span> by the end of year. Chevron is operating just four rigs in the Permian and said production there would decline <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 7% this</span> year.<br><br>Shell in April cut its dividend for the first time since World War II to avoid having to borrow to fund it. It reported a second-quarter loss <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $18.4 billion</span> on Thursday, which included <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $16.8 billion</span> write-down, while French giant Total posted <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $8.4 billion</span> loss including <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $8.1 billion</span> write-down. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Both companies report net income attributable to shareholders, a proxy for net profits.</span> BP reports Tuesday.<br><br><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Excluding impairments, Shell and Total actually turned a profit during the quarter as their trading units helped stave off even larger losses.<br><br></span>Exxon and Chevron have promised they will maintain their dividends, viewed by many investors as the most attractive part of owning their stocks. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Some analysts predict Exxon may be forced to cut its dividend <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021 if</span> market conditions don\u2019t recover.<br><br></span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Exxon\u2019s dividend payments cost the company <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">almost $15 billion</span> a year.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The company\u2019s debt grew <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by $8.8 billion</span> in the quarter, according to Goldman Sach Group Inc., which said Exxon will need oil prices <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $75 per</span> barrel <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021 to</span> cover its dividend payments from cash flow.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Exxon said Friday it wouldn\u2019t take on additional debt.<br><br></span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of energy investment firm Pickering Energy Partners LP, said the industry can survive <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $40 oil</span> but needs significantly higher prices to thrive.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">According to Mr. Pickering, who said he holds small positions in Exxon and Chevron, oil companies will have to continue cost-cutting for the foreseeable future.<br><br></span>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to assume that this is the world we\u2019re going to be in, Mr. Pickering said. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd, if this is the world we\u2019re going to be in, the cost structure is too high.\u201d<br><br></span>Dave Sebastian contributed to this article.<br><br>Write to Christopher M.

Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don\u2019t go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high.</span> Trump didn\u2019t like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.<br><br><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers.</span> U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Class 7 dairy</span> products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).<br><br>Canada\u2019s victory: <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 19,</span> allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact.

The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.<br><br><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 19 allows</span> Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u2019s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court.</span> Over the years, Canada has successfully used <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Chapter 19 to</span> challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.<br><br>Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won\u2019t pound them with auto tariffs.

Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.<br><br>Trump\u2019s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 25 percent</span> tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn\u2019t happen \u2014 yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a \u201ccompletely separate track.\u201d Trudeau has called the steel tariffs \u201cinsulting and unacceptable\u201d because the two nations are such close allies.<br><br><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Improved labor and environmental rights.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico.</span> For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen \u2014 a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.<br><br></span>Increased intellectual property protections. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The new IP chapter <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 63 pages</span> and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">negotiated 25 years</span> ago.<br><br></span>Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada.

The Committee on the Present Danger, a long-defunct group that campaigned against the dangers of the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, has recently been revived with the help of Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, to warn against the dangers of China.<br><br>Once dismissed as xenophobes and fringe elements, the group\u2019s members are finding their views increasingly embraced in President Trump\u2019s Washington, where skepticism and mistrust of China have taken hold. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Fear of China has spread across the government, from the White House to Congress to federal agencies, where Beijing\u2019s rise is unquestioningly viewed as an economic and national security threat and the defining challenge of the 21st century.<br><br></span>\u201cThese are two systems that are incompatible,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of the United States and China. \u201cOne side is going to win, and one side is going to lose.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The United States and China have been locked in difficult trade negotiations for the past two years, with talks plagued by a series of missteps and misunderstandings.</span> Mr. Trump has responded to the lack of progress by steadily ratcheting up American tariffs on Chinese goods and finding other ways to retaliate. China has responded in kind.<br><br>The two sides now appear far from any agreement that would resolve the administration\u2019s concerns about China, including forcing American companies operating there to hand over valuable technology. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Even if a deal is reached, the two sides are busy constructing broader economic barriers.<br><br></span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition to placing <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 percent</span> tariff on roughly half of the goods China exports, the United States has restricted the kinds of technologies that can be exported to China, tried to cut off some Chinese companies, like telecom giant Huawei, from purchasing American products and rolled out hurdles for Chinese investment in the United States.<br><br></span>American intelligence agencies have also ratcheted up efforts to combat Chinese espionage, particularly at universities and research institutions. Officials from the F.B.I. and the National Security Council have been dispatched to Ivy League universities to warn administrators to be vigilant against Chinese students who may be gathering technological secrets from their laboratories to pass to Beijing.<br><br>The administration paints the crackdown as necessary to protect the United States. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">But there are growing concerns that it is stoking a new red scare, fueling discrimination against students, scientists and companies with ties to China and risking the collapse of a fraught but deeply enmeshed trade relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies.<br><br></span>\u201cI\u2019m worried that some people are going to say, because of this fear, any policy is justifiable,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe climate of fear that is being created needs to help generate the conversation, not end the conversation.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Anti-China sentiment has spread quickly, with Republicans and Democrats, labor union leaders, Fox News hosts and others warning that China\u2019s efforts to build up its military and advanced industries threaten America\u2019s global leadership, and that the United States should respond aggressively.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Skepticism has seeped into nearly every aspect of China\u2019s interaction with the United States, with officials questioning China\u2019s presence on American stock markets, its construction of American subway cars and its purchase of social media networks.<br><br></span>Yet there is little agreement on what America can or should do. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The United States has tried for decades to entice and cajole China to become a more open society, but the Communist Party has steadily tightened its grip over the Chinese people and the economy.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">American leaders now face a choice of whether to continue down a path of engagement that could leave the country vulnerable to economic and security threats \u2014 or embark on a path of disengagement that could weaken both economies and might one day even lead to war.<br><br></span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">An increasing number of people in Washington now view the decoupling of the two economies as inevitable \u2014 including many of the members of the Committee on the Present Danger.</span> At an inaugural meeting in April, Mr. Bannon, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and others issued paeans to Ronald Reagan \u2014 a former member of the group \u2014 and were met with standing ovations as they called for vigilance against China.<br><br>They praised Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War victory over the Soviet Union and his doctrine of \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d but there was also an air of inevitability that war might come, only this time with China.<br><br>Mr. Bannon was just off the plane from Rome, with a slight shadow of a mustache and his silver hair brushed back. Clad in a black button-down and long black suit jacket, he thumped the podium as he described China as a rising power and the United States as a declining power that would inevitably clash.<br><br>\u201cThis is the defining event of our time, <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 100 years</span> from now, this is what they\u2019re going to remember us for,\u201d he said.<br><br>The committee\u2019s two earliest iterations, in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, called for an arms buildup to counter the Soviets. The second iteration, formed over a luncheon table at Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Club <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976,</span> issued documents warning against Soviet expansionism, with titles like \u201cIs America Becoming Number 2?\u201d<br><br>The group reached the height of its influence during the Reagan administration, in which dozens of its members eventually held posts, including as the national security adviser and C.I.A. director. But as the Soviet threat faded, so did the committee.<br><br>The group was briefly active again starting <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> this time to warn against the threat of Islamic extremism. The committee\u2019s vice chair, Frank Gaffney, is the founder of the Center for Security Policy, a think tank that argues that mosques and Muslims across America are engaged in a \u201cstealth jihad\u201d to \u201cIslamize\u201d the country by taking advantage of American pluralism and democracy.<br><br><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The group\u2019s activity largely died down until concern over China rekindled interest.<br><br></span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Today\u2019s committee acknowledges that the threat from China is different from Soviet Russia because the American and Chinese economies are much more integrated.</span> But Washington is increasingly reaching back into the Cold War toolbox to confront the threat.<br><br><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The administration has placed Chinese tech companies on an \u201centity list,\u201d essentially blacklisting them from doing business with American firms.</span> In keeping with a law passed last year, the administration has increased its checks of Chinese investment, including of minority stakes in American companies. Last June, the administration began restricting visas for Chinese graduate students in sensitive research fields like robotics and aviation. And the United States has begun barring Chinese academics from the United States if they are suspected of having links to Chinese intelligence agencies.<br><br>\u201cThey\u2019re not the Soviet Union. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">But this kind of government control, statism, never works for long,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the White House chief economic adviser, said in a <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 16 interview</span> with Sinclair Broadcast Group.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The possibility that China could collapse like the Soviet Union has \u201calways been an undercurrent\u201d in the trade war, he said.<br><br></span>The new Cold War has not been one-sided. Many of the changes in Washington have been triggered by a darker turn in Beijing.<br><br><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">China has increased its scrutiny of American firms, and many American companies and their employees in China now fear reprisal.</span> In addition to detaining millions of Chinese Muslims, democracy activists and others, Chinese authorities have jailed foreign diplomats, academics and businesspeople \u2014 prompting some to cancel or delay trips to China.<br><br>China is also projecting its power abroad, funding global infrastructure and constructing an archipelago of artificial islands with giant air bases reaching almost to the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia. Beijing has made it clear that it intends to help its companies dominate the industries of the future, from artificial intelligence and supercomputers to aerospace equipment. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Its policies have sought to replace imports of high-tech products with Chinese-made goods, pressuring multinationals to move factories from the United States and resulting in the loss of American jobs.<br><br></span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">China has rejected entreaties by the Trump administration to curb these activities, arguing that it is simply pursuing its own economic development.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">In an interview after trade talks broke down in May, Liu He, China\u2019s top negotiator, said that areas of disagreement between the United States and China focused on \u201cmajor matters of principle\u201d on which China was unlikely to bend.<br><br></span>The chill in relations has begun to weigh on Chinese investment in the United States, along with Chinese students and tourism. Chinese investment in American residential and commercial real estate has begun to decline. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Companies are increasingly diversifying away from China, wary of the president\u2019s ongoing economic war.<br><br></span>Nintendo, GoPro, Hasbro and other companies are reconsidering factories in China, choosing to source products from Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and India instead.<br><br>Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California at San Diego, said the United States is at risk of being gripped by \u201can anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare\u201d that is driving Chinese talent away and could rupture what little good will is left between the two countries.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019ve made this mistake once before, during the Cold War,\u201d Ms. Shirk said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we should make it again.\u201d<br><br>Chinese nationals and Americans of Chinese heritage say they have felt the chilling effects. Some suspect they are being passed over for promotions and grants. Supporters of engagement have been dismissed as apologists or even traitors.<br><br>\u201cChinese Americans feel targeted,\u201d said Charlie Woo, chief executive of Megatoys and a member of the Committee <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100,</span> an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really hurtful.\u201d<br><br>The Trump administration and the Committee on the Present Danger have been careful to say their targets are the Chinese government and the Communist Party, not the Chinese people. But the distinction can be a difficult one to make. In the rush to protect against new threats from China, the line between preparedness and paranoia is sometimes unclear.<br><br>At a Senate hearing last year, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said the Trump administration was trying to \u201cview the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat,\u201d adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.\u201d<br><br>Many Chinese people and their defenders have bristled at the implication that the entire Chinese society poses a national security threat.<br><br>Toby Smith, vice president for policy at the Association for American Universities, said that American universities were working hard to remain vigilant to espionage threats, but that they thrive on openness and access to talent and science from around the world \u2014 including from China.<br><br>\u201cThe situation with China is different than the Cold War,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concern with the Soviet Union was primarily military. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Now it\u2019s a concern about economic competitiveness.\u201d</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Not Relevant to the U.S. Economy": "6"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Wednesday that it <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6.9 million</span> in November, outraising its Republican counterpart for the seventh month in a row.

Democrats would only sign off on the emergency spending measure to allow lawmakers time to pass the longer-term spending deal, and they would not back the measure if doing so would allow Ryan time to set up a vote on a GOP rewrite of the Affordable Care Act.

Now it\u2019s practicing self-isolation.</h1><br>Instead, the United States\u2019 rivals, notably China and to a lesser extent Russia, have been stepping up to offer aid to other stricken nations, a role long fulfilled by the United States in crises stretching back to World War II.<br><br>Planeloads of Chinese medical equipment, masks and protective gear have been landing in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Iran and Iraq, among others.

And now, which country is looking to the United States? No one,\u201d said Elisabeth Braw of the London-based Royal United Services Institute.<br><br>America\u2019s disengagement on the coronavirus fight is part of a broader retreat from the world. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">From the Paris climate change accord to multiple trade agreements, the Trump administration has unwound decades of U.S. leadership on a range of issues.<br><br></span>But such is the severity of this crisis that America\u2019s absence could permanently impact its standing, ceding ground to an ascendant China in the great game of global influence, analysts said.<br><br>\u201cI do wonder whether this really is an inflection point in the international system,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, the head of the Italian Institute of International Affairs and a former foreign policy adviser to senior European Union leaders.<br><br>\u201cHere in Italy it is going to change for good the perception of who is leading in the world, and it\u2019s not the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so strong what is happening. It\u2019s so powerful and it\u2019s so traumatic. The emotions that it ignites today are going to be engraved in the national narrative.\u201d<br><br>There\u2019s an element of opportunism in some of the gestures by the United States\u2019 rivals. Huawei, the Chinese technology giant accused by the United States of acting as a branch of China\u2019s intelligence agencies, has seized the opportunity to promote its brand to stricken Europeans at a time when their governments are weighing whether to adopt its high-speed 5G cellular network, despite US requests not to do so.<br><br>The company has delivered thousands of masks and other equipment bearing the Huawei logo to hard-hit countries, which may help win support for its 5G network once the crisis subsides.<br><br>\u201cChina is sending medical supplies, but it is it a good Samaritan or is it simply doing it to exploit tensions in the Western alliance?\u201d asked Braw. \u201cIt\u2019s very opportunistic and it\u2019s clear China senses a vacuum.<br><br>\u201cBut unless the Trump administration ups its game, this could be the moment in world history where the trend pivots in favor of China,\u201d she added.<br><br>Russia has likewise sensed opportunity in the vacuum of American leadership, sending a cargo plane of medical aid to Italy earlier this week. But Italian officials told Italian media that the offer was unsolicited and the equipment and medicine sent didn\u2019t match Italy\u2019s needs.<br><br>U.S. officials say they have offered assistance. U.S. troops based in Italy helped send and deliver hospital beds, mattresses, stretchers and other equipment to the Italian province of Lombardy, the ground zero of Italy\u2019s coronavirus crisis.<br><br>In late January, when China\u2019s outbreak was at its peak, the U.S. government said it was sending more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 17 tons</span> of medical equipment there. In early February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $100 million</span> in assistance \u201cto China.\u201d<br><br>The State Department modified that in later statements, saying the aid would go to high-risk and developing countries, with no mention of China. A Chinese official last week said that China had received \u201cnot $1\u201d from the United States.<br><br>Some of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $100 million</span> has been committed to the World Health Organization and other multilateral institutions, said Pooja Jhunjhunwala, acting spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development.<br><br>The agency has <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">designated 25 countries</span> to receive direct assistance, most of them in Central and Southeast Asia. Delivery of the pledged donations, to the extent it has taken place, has remained largely invisible on the world stage, however.<br><br>Rajiv Shah, who as head of USAID coordinated the U.S. response to <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2014 Ebola</span> virus outbreak centered in Africa, stressed the need for international cooperation.<br><br>\u201cIt has to be all of the United States, and has to be all of the world,\u201d Shah, now president of the Rockefeller Foundation, told Bloomberg TV on Monday.<br><br>During the Ebola outbreak, he said, \u201cAmerica always leads those kinds of coalitions. It is our resources, our expertise, our technical capacity and our standing in the world that allows us to do that. I fear that\u2019s not happening today.\u201d<br><br>Both Russia and China have also been promoting disinformation about the coronavirus, countering the language of top American officials such as Trump and Pompeo that the coronavirus is a Chinese virus by advancing conspiracy theories, such as that the pathogen may have been developed in American laboratories, said Braw. A European task force set up to combat Kremlin disinformation has reported <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">counting 110 such</span> cases from Russian sources between Jan.<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 and</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span><br><br>Meanwhile, the chaotic American response to the spread of the virus in the United States is undermining its reputation as a global leader in science and technology. TV footage of New Yorkers queuing in the cold for scarce virus tests has been broadcast worldwide, accentuating the sense that America can\u2019t manage its own coronavirus epidemic, let alone lead other countries out of theirs.<br><br>American enemies have seized the opportunity to take digs. \u201cSpend it on yourself,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as he rejected an offer of U.S. assistance to help Iran fight the coronavirus. \u201cYou have shortages yourself.\u201d<br><br>The United States has now expanded the availability of testing, said Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based global health expert with the New America organization. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But masks, protective gear and other medical equipment remain in critically short supply in some parts of the country, and with coronavirus infections increasing at the rate of more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10,000 a</span> day, the United States looks set to become the world epicenter of the covid-19 disease.<br><br></span>\u201cOverall it looks like the United States is on the path for becoming the most endemic country for the coronavirus, more than China, more than Italy, more than any other country,\u201d he said.<br><br>As other countries impose drastic lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, the Trump administration is seen by many overseas as an outlier.<br><br>\u201cEven India, with a population <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1.3 billion</span>, is going into lockdown. Yet at the leadership level, the United States is talking about opening up the country when it hasn\u2019t even fully locked down,\u201d Rahim said.<br><br>\u201cVery few countries today see the U.S. as part of the solution, whereas in the past it was the natural point of comparison, or a country to imitate,\u201d Luis Rubio, head of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations.<br><br><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Moreover, he said, Trump\u2019s at-times dismissive approach to the coronavirus may be encouraging other populist leaders who remain resistant to taking harsh and economically difficult measures to confront the epidemic.</span> Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called lockdowns ordered by his country\u2019s mayors a \u201ccrime\u201d and invoked Trump in comments minimizing the seriousness of the coronavirus.<br><br>Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is another leader who has been encouraged by Trump\u2019s cavalier approach, Rubio said.<br><br>\u201cThe U.S. administration also prolonged, rather than taking the bull by the horns. It wasted several days or weeks and showed the way to many people, like President L\u00f3pez Obrador, that it was possible to pretend it wasn\u2019t going to hurt,\u201d he said.<br><br>Birnbaum reported from Brussels. DeYoung reported from Washington.

{"id": "30092", "displayed_text": "<h1>After Calling Nafta \u2018Worst Trade Deal,\u2019 Trump Appears to Soften Stance</h1><br><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, who has called the North American Free Trade Agreement \u201cthe worst trade deal\u201d ever signed by the United States, appears to have softened one of the hard-line positions that animated his presidential campaign.<br><br></span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">He is set to propose keeping major planks of Nafta in place, according to a draft letter to Congress that lays out goals for renegotiating the trade pact with Canada and Mexico.<br><br></span>But his administration is seeking to add more protections for American products and industries. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">A proposed provision would allow tariffs to be reinstated if a flood of imports threatened to harm a domestic industry.</span> Mr. Trump also wants to adjust the agreement\u2019s rules of origin, or how much of a product must be made in a Nafta country. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">And he wants Nafta partners to expand the market for United States-made goods in their government procurement.<br><br></span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn terms of what we consider to be President Trump\u2019s economic nationalist objectives and what he has said previously about Nafta, the list of negotiating terms was relatively benign,\u201d said Scott S. Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White & Case.</span>Continue reading the main story<br><br>Mr. Trump has often said that the United States could abandon Nafta altogether if renegotiating it is not possible. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">He has signaled that he wants to move swiftly to reorder the nation\u2019s trade policies, and Wilbur L. Ross, the commerce secretary, said during his Senate confirmation hearing that addressing Nafta would be among his first priorities.<br><br></span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the hawkish rhetoric of the campaign has given way to more measured statements on trade from the administration that track more closely with the stance of many congressional Republicans, who are avid promoters of free trade and deeply skeptical of policies they view as restrictive or protectionist.<br><br></span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Peter Navarro, head of the White House National Trade Council, said this month that Mexico, Canada and the United States should unite to become a regional manufacturing \u201cpowerhouse,\u201d where workers in all three countries benefit.<br><br></span>The tone of the eight-page draft letter, which was reported by The Wall Street Journal, did not echo Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign speeches. Nowhere was there a mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to pull out of the agreement. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But the letter, signed by Stephen Vaughn, the acting United States trade representative, did say, \u201cThe persistent U.S. deficit in goods trade with Canada and Mexico demands that this administration take swift action to revise the relationship to reflect and respond to 21st century challenges.\u201d<br><br></span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a former Mexican trade official, said the letter suggested a softening in tone but also contained several proposals that were likely to prompt a strong response from the Mexican government.<br><br></span>\u201cThere are some specific problems,\u201d said Mr. Ortiz-Mena, now a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington. \u201cBut in terms of the language used during the campaign and at the beginning of the administration, it\u2019s not as far-reaching as some people could have expected.\u201d<br><br>The assessment that the actual policies of the United States might not end up being as harsh as those espoused by Mr. Trump during the campaign is reflected in the confidence in the Mexican peso. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Since the inauguration, measured against a basket of currencies, it has gained <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 17.5 percent</span> in value, more than any other major currency in the world.</span> On Thursday, it traded <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 18.72 pesos</span> to the dollar, approaching the levels it held before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.<br><br>The Canadian government declined on Thursday to comment directly on the draft proposals, since Nafta negotiations have not begun. \u201cShould notice of intent to renegotiate be given, Canada is prepared to discuss improvements at the appropriate time,\u201d said Global Affairs Canada, the country\u2019s foreign ministry.<br><br><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Among Canadian trade experts, the proposals were met with relief, but the suspense has not ended.</span> While the draft does not amount to a total dismissal of Nafta, it outlines American priorities that could threaten Canadian industries. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s not ripping Nafta, but there are a bunch of sticks of dynamite contained in those pages,\u201d said Mark Warner, a Canadian-American trade lawyer based in Toronto.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a messy, hard-slogging negotiation.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The letter calls for expanding market access among the three countries and eliminating licensing and permit barriers that tend to stall commerce.</span> It also calls for maintaining \u201creciprocal access\u201d for textile and apparel products.<br><br><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Rather than scrap Nafta\u2019s arbitration tribunals, regarded by some free-trade critics as secretive bodies that give private corporations unbridled power to challenge foreign governments outside the court system, the letter proposes to \u201cmaintain and seek to improve procedures\u201d for settling disputes.<br><br></span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The draft also makes no mention of currency policy, an issue that many trade experts thought might be on the table.<br><br></span>The administration does give itself room to get tougher. The proposal for reinstating tariffs, often referred to as a snapback, is billed as a \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d to protect domestic industries. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The draft also suggests seeking to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d on tax treatment.</span> Such measures could bring objections from Canada and Mexico.<br><br><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have argued that Mexico uses its value-added tax as a tariff that puts the United States at a disadvantage.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The president has called for a tax on companies that move their operations to Mexico and try to sell products in the United States.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Republicans in Congress are considering a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d that would make imports more expensive.<br><br></span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">American business welcomed the additional specifics on trade policy in the letter.</span> \u201cThe details in the letter have whet our appetite for more,\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.<br><br><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Automakers and car dealers have expressed concerns that any changes to Nafta could disrupt the strong vehicle market in the United States.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler operate plants in Mexico that supply models popular with American consumers, such as pickup trucks.</span> Their assembly plants in the United States also rely on a steady flow of parts made by Mexican suppliers.<br><br><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The industry, including dealers, is particularly worried that Mr. Trump might follow through on the border tax on vehicles imported from Mexico.<br><br></span>Mr. Ross, the commerce secretary, said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday that changing the rules of origin would actually benefit car companies. \u201cThe many problems with the rules of origins in Nafta as presently drafted is that in the case of, say, autos, it went specifically part by part,\u201d he said. \u201cNafta\u2019s an old agreement, and many of those parts are no longer even used in cars because automotive technology has moved on.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has been adamantly opposed to multilateral trade deals, arguing that he can negotiate better agreements bilaterally.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">It remains unclear from the draft proposal, however, whether the administration\u2019s ideas for rewriting Nafta would have an impact on trade deficits.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">It does not put forth any sort of target or range for the size of the trade deficit the United States would be willing to tolerate.</span> And nowhere is there a mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to pull out of the agreement.<br><br>Withdrawing from Nafta unilaterally could be more complicated that Mr. Trump realized as a candidate. The draft proposal seems to recognize that opening negotiations among the three countries will be a delicate challenge.<br><br>Mr. Trump would need to give <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Congress 90 days</span>\u2019 notice before he could begin negotiations, meaning they could not start until midsummer at the earliest.<br><br>\u201cThere is much to like about it.

The Trump administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations implemented under Obama have failed to spark a revival in communities like Cumberland that formed his political base during <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 election</span>.<br><br>Cumberland is located in Harlan County, where Trump <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">won 85 percent</span> of the vote. But these miners say their fight isn\u2019t a political one. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">At the camp, there is an informal policy against speaking about Trump or partisan issues, underscoring the president\u2019s continued popularity in areas where the local economy has continued to suffer.<br><br></span>\u201cThat is the main reason we have gotten as far as we\u2019ve got now; it\u2019s because we have kept the nonsense down,\u201d Rowe said, referring to the nation\u2019s divisive political debate.<br><br><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Although the number of Americans employed in the coal industry nationwide has remained relatively steady since Trump took office, analysts say the industry faces a rocky future as energy suppliers continue to shift toward renewable sources and relatively low-cost natural gas.</span> Annual U.S. coal production is expected to drop <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 711 million</span> tons to less <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 600 million</span> tons during the next five years, said Gregory Marmon, a principal coal analyst at global consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.<br><br><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe administration has definitely pulled back regulations, and that has stopped some of the bleeding, but renewable energy is so cost-effective, and natural gas prices are so low, the pulling back of some regulations has not been able to stop the decline of coal,\u201d Marmon said.<br><br></span>[In small towns across the nation, the death of a coal plant leaves an unmistakable void]<br><br>Blackjewel, which operated mines in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, abruptly announced <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 1 that</span> it was shutting down operations. Paychecks bounced or were clawed out of miners\u2019 accounts. Other paychecks were never issued.<br><br>\u201cWe had just bought a washer, and then the bank pulled the money back out, and it made our account negative,\u201d said Stacy Rowe, Chris Rowe\u2019s wife.<br><br><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The effect of those missed paychecks has rippled through the county\u2019s economy.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Many of the miners <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">made $20 to</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $30 an</span> hour, a middle-class salary in a county where the household median income <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is $24,000 a</span> year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.<br><br></span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Upset that the product of his labor was about to leave town while his bank account showed a negative balance <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $2,100,</span> Sexton phoned Rowe and other miners to stop the coal train on <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 29,</span> an act of defiance that continues today.<br><br></span>After a tense standoff with Kentucky State Police troopers, the rail cars remained stationary and the miners were permitted to continue their protest. The workers have erected blue and white tarps along the rail tracks to create a makeshift kitchen, children\u2019s playroom, and a space to collect donated clothes and canned goods. Portable toilets have been trucked in. Each night, miners pitch tents or sleep in their trucks to avoid the coyotes and black bears that pass these rail tracks parallel to a tributary of the Cumberland River named \u201cPoor Fork.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf that train leaves, we ain\u2019t got nothing,\u201d said Sexton,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> who said Blackjewel owes him <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $5,000.</span> \u201cThis is all we got left, because we mined it and still ain\u2019t got paid for it.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department has sought an injunction to prevent Blackjewel from moving the rail car, which is estimated to have <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $1 million</span> in coal, according to local media reports.<br><br></span>Meanwhile, a team of attorneys is working to help the miners, who were not unionized, to secure back pay and other damages as part of bankruptcy proceedings. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Sam Petsonk, a West Virginia attorney who is <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">representing 1,100 of</span> the laid-off employees, said the miners\u2019 plight highlights the need to reform bankruptcy laws so employee wages and benefits are more highly prioritized in such legal proceedings.<br><br></span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Blackjewel is selling off mines as part of the bankruptcy proceedings and, in at least one case, \u201cthe buyer has committed to assume and pay outstanding employee obligations,\u201d according to a statement from interim CEO David Beckman.<br><br></span>The previous chief executive, Jeffrey Hoops Sr., resigned on <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 3.</span><br><br>\u201cBlackjewel knows that each day that passes creates additional hardship for miners who have not yet been brought back to work and their families,\u201d Beckman said. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The company \u201ccontinues to work tirelessly on finding ways to make all of the employees whole on their pre-petition wages.\u201d<br><br></span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The protest has brought attention to the decline of labor unions across coal country, particularly in Harlan County, site of a violent uprising in the 1930s by coal miners who attempted to form a union.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">As mines shut down in recent decades, amid declining reserves and more stringent environmental regulations, they have been replaced with smaller, less labor-intensive operations that relied on nonunionized workers.<br><br></span>Now, there are no unionized coal mines in Kentucky, according to Phil Smith, the director of communications and government affairs for the United Mine Workers of America. Nationwide, just about a quarter of the nation\u2019<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 38,000 hourly</span> coal miners are represented by the United Mine Workers, Smith added.<br><br><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\u201cThese workers are showing how all workers are vulnerable to the efforts of corporations to deny them wages and benefits, but you can come together as a group and challenge it,\u201d said William J. Londrigan, president of the Kentucky AFL-CIO.<br><br></span>[Rural Appalachia lags the rest of the country in infant mortality and life expectancy]<br><br>The fight has attracted national attention. Farmer Wayne Cryts <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drove 12 hours</span> from Missouri to show support for the coal workers\u2019 cause.<br><br>While visiting the camp last week, he told Sexton and Rowe that he made national headlines in the early 1980s when he nearly <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lost 31,000 bushels</span> of soybeans after the company that stored it declared bankruptcy. With his crop tied up in court proceedings, Cryts and dozens of supporters tried to force their way into the grain elevator to retrieve his harvest. The move triggered a protracted legal battle that eventually landed Cryts in prison.<br><br>\u201cI can tell you from experience, that coal is the only leverage you got,\u201d said Cryts, who vowed to return if authorities try to forcibly break up the camp.<br><br>Meanwhile, all around them, storefronts are boarded up and signs advertising payday loans are affixed to power poles. Some Cumberland residents say their faith in the U.S. political system is being tested.<br><br><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt just feels like we are still waiting\u201d for Trump\u2019s vow to revive the economies of depressed communities, said Boe Montgomery,<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59.</span></span> \u201cThis town is just about done in, and they might as well just make it a lake.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But Dan Mosley, the county executive, said the overall health of Harlan County\u2019s economy had been on an upswing in recent years before the Blackjewel bankruptcy.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The county had <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 13 percent</span> unemployment rate in <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2017,</span> when Trump was sworn into office, but it had fallen to <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 7 percent</span>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The unemployment rate surged back <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 13 percent</span> in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.<br><br></span>The closure of the Blackjewel mines shouldn\u2019t be viewed as \u201can issue that affects the president in any way,\u201d Mosley said.<br><br><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is an issue of one failed company, and one failed executive who didn\u2019t manage his company the right way,\u201d said Mosley, a Democrat, who added the region also needs to continue diversifying its economy.<br><br></span>As he sat in the protest camp last week, holding his 9-month-old daughter, 29-year-old David Pratt said being laid off made him decide to go to college to get his nursing degree.<br><br>\u201cI just started last Monday and decided to do it while I\u2019m still young enough,\u201d said Pratt, noting he\u2019s now been laid off three times from three different coal companies over the <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 11 years</span>.<br><br>But many of the miners say they remain optimistic they will soon be able to return to work after Blackjewel\u2019s Kentucky assets are sold off to a new owner.<br><br>If that happens, though, the miners believe their protest will have sent a powerful message to their new boss as well.<br><br>\u201cCoal will make a comeback, maybe not a big comeback, but it will come back,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cAnd hopefully these companies will see guys are going to start standing up again.\u201d", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}

It Looks Worse.</h1><br>This Year\u2019s Selloff in Chinese Markets Isn\u2019t <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Like 2015.</span> It Looks Worse.<br><br><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Several signs suggest that investors are responding rationally to signs of fundamental problems for China\u2019s economy<br><br>SHANGHAI\u2014This year\u2019s selloff in China\u2019s stocks and currency is reviving painful memories of the country\u2019s last market rout, in the summer <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2015.</span></span> If anything, things look more worrying this time around.<br><br>Shares in Shanghai are the world\u2019s worst performing among major markets this year, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">tumbling 17%.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The yuan has <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">slumped 3.6% against</span> the dollar since the start of June, pushed down by a combination of selling by nervous investors and the Chinese central bank\u2019s efforts to guide the currency lower as a trade conflict with the U.S. escalates.<br><br></span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">On paper, even those big market moves pale in comparison <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 2015.</span></span> Three years ago the Shanghai Composite Index lost nearly half its value in the two months starting in June, bottoming out only in early 2016: They have never since regained their mid-2015 highs. The central bank also shocked markets with an <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">abrupt 2% devaluation</span> of the yuan in August that year.<br><br><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">More concerning this time round is that several factors, including Beijing\u2019s campaign against high debt levels and its trade war with the U.S., suggest that investors are responding rationally to signs of fundamental problems for China\u2019s economy.<br><br></span>The U.S. placed tariffs <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $34 billion</span> worth of Chinese goods at midnight Eastern time on Friday. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">And while Shanghai stocks <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose .5% on</span> Friday, their fall this year has accelerated since trade tensions ramped up in the spring.<br><br></span>Related Coverage<br><br><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">By contrast, <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 the</span> market boom and bust was driven by retail investors who\u2014initially with government encouragement\u2014had taken on piles of debt to bet on stocks, then rushed to sell when the market cooled.<br><br></span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201c<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2015 market</span> crash was like unexpectedly catching a fever that came fast but also went fast.</span> What we are witnessing this time is a likely protracted decline,\u201d said Landing Zhang, chief executive of Shanghai asset-management firm CYAMLAN Investment.<br><br><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">One big difference between this year <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 2015 is</span> that institutional investors, who typically take a longer-term view of markets, appear to be driving the equity-market selloff.<br><br></span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">No breakdown of market trading by investor class is available, but a couple of factors indicate professionals are in the lead.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">First, much of this year\u2019s Shanghai market slump is due to falling share prices of major state-owned Chinese companies such as Citic Securities and Baoshan Iron & Steel.</span> Such blue-chip stocks are normally favored by big institutional investors.<br><br><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe latest selloff was definitely led by institutions, because in the past when the market fell, blue chips often bucked the trend.</span> This time around, blue chips are falling, too, and it has been like a stampede,\u201d said Amy Lin, a senior analyst at brokerage Capital Securities.<br><br><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">A sharp fall in the use of margin finance, which enables investors to bet on stocks with borrowed money, is a sign that China\u2019<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 90 million</span> retail investors have had relatively less influence over this year\u2019s market slump.</span> The value of margin loans outstanding is down <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 908.9 billion</span> yuan ($137 billion) as of Thursday, less than half the <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 2.1 trillion</span> yuan right before <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 summer</span> rout.<br><br>\u201cNobody, including myself and many of my friends, wants to invest in anything. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">There\u2019s no confidence, and we are in no mood,\u201d said Wu Yunfeng, a retail investor from Shanghai who said he hasn\u2019t invested in stocks since last year.<br><br></span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Institutional investors\u2019 increasingly pessimistic view of China\u2019s outlook has started being borne out by economic data.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Despite solid growth in the first quarter, figures for May showed a slowdown in areas including investment and retail sales.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Beijing\u2019s campaign against shadow-banking activity more than halved China\u2019s overall credit supply in May.<br><br></span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economy was in better shape <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> and the stock market had rallied for a long time before the crash.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">There was also no trade war at that time,\u201d Ms. Lin said.<br><br></span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">For some, the market gloom is an overdue reflection of the difficult task policy makers in Beijing face in trying to juggle a financial-system housecleaning while protecting economic growth\u2014all against the backdrop of a trade war.<br><br></span>China\u2019s central bank has faced a dilemma when it comes to managing the yuan\u2019s level against the dollar, too. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Rising U.S. interest rates and slowing Chinese growth have created market pressure for the yuan to fall.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Beijing may be happy to see the yuan slide, in part to offset any impact on its exports as trade tensions rise.<br><br></span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Still, policy makers are eager not to let the yuan drop too far, too fast, in case that encourages heavy capital outflows that could cause a liquidity shortage in China\u2019s financial system.<br><br></span>\u201cIt does make sense to witness a shift in sentiment because we were always surprised by how sanguine Beijing has looked with its deleveraging campaign. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">We didn\u2019t think it was priced in by the market,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Singapore-based economist at research firm Capital Economics.<br><br></span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Investor uncertainty over whether Beijing can pull off a deleveraging of China\u2019s economy and avoid a significant slowdown has deepened amid some mixed signs from policy makers.</span> While authorities have tried to cut back on credit by shadow-banking institutions, they have also freed up more funds for bank lending three times this year.<br><br><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe government wants to guide more money into the real economy, but it hasn\u2019t been easy because investors aren\u2019t showing lots of confidence in Chinese companies, especially those in the manufacturing sector,\u201d said CYAMLAN Investment\u2019s Mr. Zhang.<br><br></span>Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Not Relevant to
