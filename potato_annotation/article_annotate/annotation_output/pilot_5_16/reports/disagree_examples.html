respond to precipitous declines on China’s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country’s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, in a bid to stabilize the markets.<br></span>The government-controlled Securities Association of China said <span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that 21 big</span> brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">least 120 billion</span> renminbi, <span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">or $19.4 billion</span>, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and would stop liquidating their own portfolios of shares. <span id="1" class="red">But some experts said that this might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">that $105 billion</span> in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.<br></span>The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. <span id="2" class="red">That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.<br></span><span id="3" class="red">“If it’s <span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">only 120 billion</span> renminbi, to be honest it’s too small, but if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks,” said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China’s fifth-largest bank.<br></span><span id="4" class="red">The announcement came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter century.</span> <span id="5" class="red">Share prices have fallen nearly a third since <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="10" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="19" class="yellow"

on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.<br></span><span id="6" class="red">The design of the brokerage industry’s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market <span id="7" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 1998,</span> during the Asian financial crisis.</span> <span id="7" class="red">The fund had previously invested the Hong Kong government’s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates.</span> <span id="8" class="red">But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.<br></span><span id="9" class="red">A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members juxtaposed an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric in urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.</span> <span id="10" class="red">“Excessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,” the statement said, “and as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.”<br></span><span id="11" class="red">The Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices.</span> China’s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the past week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.<br><span id="12" class="red">But the design of the securities industry’s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have been borrowing heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said.</span> <span id="13" class="red">Shares in large companies represent only <span id="8" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">about 30 percent</span> of the overall value of

period.<br></span><span id="17" class="red">Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money.</span> <span id="18"

financial companies at annual interest rates <span id="15" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">exceeding 20 percent</span>.<br></span>The bailout funds could also end up helping big state-owned enterprises at the expense of smaller businesses, which tend to be in the private sector. <span id="19" class="red">President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have spoken of their desire to increase the role of the private sector as a way to improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy.<br></span><span id="20" class="red">Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets — the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.<br></span><span id="21" class="red">Hours after the securities industry’s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives <span id="16"

it would do so.<br></span>Another worry lies in whether many Chinese mutual funds and other investment funds may be required to liquidate suddenly. Many of these funds have rules on losses in the underlying contracts that formed them: If the value of the fund <span id="17" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">falls 30 percent</span>, the fund must return the remaining money to shareholders, typically by cashing in all of its shares.<br><span id="23" class="red">With the Shanghai stock market <span id="18" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">down 28.6 percent</span> since <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="10" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"><span id="19" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">June 12,</span></span></span> that rule is starting to appear to be a possible risk to the broader market, Mr. Hong said.<br></span><span id="24" class="red"><span id="20" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">The 21 brokerages</span> said that they would not resume selling shares from their own portfolios until the Shanghai stock index returns <span id="21" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">to 4,500</span>; it closed on Friday <span id="22" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">at 3,686.915.</span><br></span><span id="25" class="red">But Tao Zhigang, an economist who is the director of the Institute for China and Global Development at Hong Kong University, said that setting a specific target <span id="23" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">like 4,500 ran</span> the risk that many investors may conclude the government will do whatever is necessary to push the market to that level.<br></span>That may prompt investors to borrow even more money on the conviction of a guaranteed return, he said.<br><br>PROLIFIC: <i>none</i><br>HOUSE: <i>other</i><br><br><br><br><h1>A New Red Scare Is Reshaping Washington</h1><br>WASHINGTON — In a ballroom across from the Capitol building, an unlikely group of military hawks, populist crusaders, Chinese Muslim freedom fighters and followers of the Falun Gong has been meeting to warn anyone who will listen that China poses an existential threat to the United States that will not end until the Communist Party is overthrown.<br>If the warnings sound straight out of the Cold War, they are.

Officials from the F.B.I. and the National Security Council have been dispatched to Ivy League universities to warn administrators to be vigilant against Chinese students who may be gathering technological secrets from their laboratories to pass to Beijing.<br>The administration paints the crackdown as necessary to protect the United States. <span id="4" class="red">But there are growing concerns that it is stoking a new red scare, fueling discrimination against students, scientists and companies with ties to China and risking the collapse of a fraught but deeply enmeshed trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies.<br></span>“I’m worried that some people are going to say, because of this fear, any policy is justifiable,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The climate of fear that is being created needs to help generate the conversation, not end the conversation.”<br><span id="5" class="red">Anti-China sentiment has spread quickly, with Republicans and Democrats, labor union leaders, Fox News hosts and others warning that China’s efforts to build up its military and advanced industries threaten America’s global leadership, and that the United States should respond aggressively.</span> <span id="6" class="red">Skepticism has seeped into nearly every aspect of China’s interaction with the United States, with officials questioning China’s presence on American stock markets, its construction of American subway cars and its purchase of social media networks.<br></span>Yet there is little agreement on what America can or should do. <span id="7" class="red">The United States has tried for decades to entice and cajole China to become a more open society, but the Communist Party has steadily tightened its grip over the Chinese people and the economy.</span> <span id="8" class="red">American leaders now face a choice of whether to continue down a path of engagement that could leave the country vulnerable to economic and security threats — or embark on a path of disengagement that could weaken both economies and might one day even lead to war.<br></span><span id="9" class="red">An increasing number of people in Washington now view the decoupling of the two economies as inevitable — including many of the members of the Committee on the Present Danger.</span> At an inaugural meeting in April, Mr. Bannon, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and others issued paeans to Ronald Reagan — a former member of the group — and were met with standing ovations as they called for vigilance against China.<br>They praised Mr. Reagan’s Cold War victory over the Soviet Union and his doctrine of “peace through strength,” but there was also an air of inevitability that war might come, only this time with China.<br>Mr. Bannon was just off the plane from Rome, with a slight shadow of a mustache and his silver hair brushed back. Clad in a black button-down and long black suit jacket, he thumped the podium as he described China as a rising power and the United States as a declining power that would inevitably clash.<br>“This is the defining event of our time, <span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">and 100 years</span> from now, this is what they’re going to remember us for,” he said.<br>The committee’s two earliest iterations, in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, called for an arms buildup to counter the Soviets. The second iteration, formed over a luncheon table at Washington’s Metropolitan Club <span id="2" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 1976,</span> issued documents warning against Soviet expansionism, with titles like “Is America Becoming Number 2?”<br>The group reached the height of its influence during the Reagan administration, in which dozens of its members eventually held posts, including as the national security adviser and C.I.A. director. But as the Soviet threat faded, so did the committee.<br>The group was briefly active again starting <span id="3" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">in 2004,</span> this time to warn against the threat of Islamic extremism. The committee’s vice chair, Frank Gaffney, is the founder of the Center for Security Policy, a think tank that argues that mosques and Muslims across America are engaged in a “stealth jihad” to “Islamize” the country by taking advantage of American pluralism and democracy.<br><span id="10" class="red">The group’s activity largely died down until concern over China rekindled interest.<br></span><span id="11" class="red">Today’s committee acknowledges that the threat from China is different from Soviet Russia because the American and Chinese economies are much more integrated.</span> But Washington is increasingly reaching back into the Cold War toolbox to confront the threat.<br><span id="12" class="red">The administration has placed Chinese tech companies on an “entity list,” essentially blacklisting them from doing business with American firms.</span> In keeping with a law passed last year, the administration has increased its checks of Chinese investment, including of minority stakes in American companies. Last June, the administration began restricting visas for Chinese graduate students in sensitive research fields like robotics and aviation. And the United States has begun barring Chinese academics from the United States if they are suspected of having links to Chinese intelligence agencies.<br>“They’re not the Soviet Union. <span id="13" class="red">But this kind of government control, statism, never works for long,” Larry Kudlow, the White House chief economic adviser, said in a <span id="4" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">July 16 interview</span> with Sinclair Broadcast Group.</span> <span id="14" class="red">The possibility that China could collapse like the Soviet Union has “always been an undercurrent” in the trade war, he said.<br></span>The new Cold War has not been one-sided. Many of the changes in Washington have been triggered by a darker turn in Beijing.<br><span id="15" class="red">China has increased its scrutiny of American firms, and many American companies and their employees in China now fear reprisal.</span> In addition to detaining millions of Chinese Muslims, democracy activists and others, Chinese authorities have jailed foreign diplomats, academics and businesspeople — prompting some to cancel or delay trips to China.<br>China is also projecting its power abroad, funding global infrastructure and constructing an archipelago of artificial islands with giant air bases reaching almost to the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia. Beijing has made it clear that it intends to help its companies dominate the industries of the future, from artificial intelligence and supercomputers to aerospace equipment. <span id="16" class="red">Its policies have sought to replace imports of high-tech products with Chinese-made goods, pressuring multinationals to move factories from the United States and resulting in the loss of American jobs.<br></span><span id="17" class="red">China has rejected entreaties by the Trump administration to curb these activities, arguing that it is simply pursuing its own economic development.</span> <span id="18" class="red">In an interview after trade talks broke down in May, Liu He, China’s top negotiator, said that areas of disagreement between the United States and China focused on “major matters of principle” on which China was unlikely to bend.<br></span>The chill in relations has begun to weigh on Chinese investment in the United States, along with Chinese students and tourism. Chinese investment in American residential and commercial real estate has begun to decline. <span id="19" class="red">Companies are increasingly diversifying away from China, wary of the president’s ongoing economic war.<br></span>Nintendo, GoPro, Hasbro and other companies are reconsidering factories in China, choosing to source products from Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and India instead.<br>Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California at San Diego, said the United States is at risk of being gripped by “an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare” that is driving Chinese talent away and could rupture what little good will is left between the two countries.<br>“We’ve made this mistake once before, during the Cold War,” Ms. Shirk said. “And I don’t think we should make it again.”<br>Chinese nationals and Americans of Chinese heritage say they have felt the chilling effects. Some suspect they are being passed over for promotions and grants. Supporters of engagement have been dismissed as apologists or even traitors.<br>“Chinese Americans feel targeted,” said Charlie Woo, chief executive of Megatoys and a member of the Committee <span id="5" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);">of 100,</span> an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans. “And that’s really hurtful.”<br>The Trump administration and the Committee on the Present Danger have been careful to say their targets are the Chinese government and the Communist Party, not the Chinese people. But the distinction can be a difficult one to make. In the rush to protect against new threats from China, the line between preparedness and paranoia is sometimes unclear.<br>At a Senate hearing last year, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said the Trump administration was trying to “view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat,” adding, “I think it’s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.”<br>Many Chinese people and their defenders have bristled at the implication that the entire Chinese society poses a national security threat.<br>Toby Smith, vice president for policy at the Association for American Universities, said that American universities were working hard to remain vigilant to espionage threats, but that they thrive on openness and access to talent and science from around the world — including from China.<br>“The situation with China is different than the Cold War,” he said. “The concern with the Soviet Union was primarily military. <span id="20" class="red">Now it’s a concern about economic competitiveness.”</span><br><br>PROLIFIC: <i>none</i><br>HOUSE: <i>government</i><br><br><br><br><h1>A Tale of Two Steel Firms and Their Diverging Paths Under Trump’s Tariffs</h1><br><span id="0" class="red">Profits and raises are back at one, while the other is cutting costs and delaying investments<br><br>Feb.<span id="0" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"> 10,</span><span id="1" class="yellow" onclick="annotateQuant(this);"> 2019 7</span>:00 am ET<br><br>Nearly a year after the U.S. imposed tariffs on imported steel, the higher prices have been a godsend for Byer Steel Co.</span> The family-owned Ohio company last year posted its first profit in four years and surprised workers with year-end bonuses.<br><br>The tariffs “are giving us the ability to get off our knees for a minute,” said Burke Byer, whose great-grandfather founded the Cincinnati company a century ago. “We’re not so hand-to-mouth.”<br><br><span id="1" class="red">The same tariffs have pinched another small family business:</span> Laclede Chain Manufacturing Co. <span id="2" class="red">The St. Louis-based maker of steel chains had been on a growth spurt before higher steel prices forced it to refocus on cost cutting.<br><br></span>Surcharges have helped offset higher raw-material costs but don’t “make us whole,” said Tim Riley, president of the 165-year-old company.
