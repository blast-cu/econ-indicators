The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Wednesday that it <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6.9 million</span> in November, outraising its Republican counterpart for the seventh month in a row. In November, the National Republican Congressional Committee raised <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $3.8 million</span>.<br><br>House Republicans, however, still have more money on hand and the Republican National Committee has far more cash than the Democratic National Committee. In the Senate, the Democratic campaign arm has slightly more money in the bank than the Republicans.<br><br>Beyond the raw numbers, Democratic enthusiasm is soaring. And the sort of centrist voters that both parties covet are contemptuous of Mr. Trump because of his behavior and character, elements that are highly unlikely to change by next fall no matter what policies emerge from Washington.<br><br><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe downside of doing nothing was much higher,\u201d former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who previously led the party\u2019s House campaign efforts, said of the tax bill.</span> \u201cBut the major problem for Republicans is not that they haven\u2019t delivered \u2014 it\u2019s the way he conducts himself.\u201d<br><br>\u201cRepublicans have a big storm coming at them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad wind storm or a Category Five hurricane.\u201d<br><br>Mr. Trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president this soon into his tenure, and midterm elections are inevitably referendums on the party that controls the White House. He is especially unpopular among women, who in this year\u2019s statewide and special elections have overwhelmingly supported Democrats. According to a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll,<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 62 percent</span> of female voters disapproved of Mr. Trump.<br><br><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">So Democrats, some of them still bearing wounds from President Barack Obama\u2019s midterm losses, believe the tax measure will ultimately be of little consequence compared to the man who occupies the Oval Office.<br><br></span>\u201cYou can\u2019t run from the top of your ticket,\u201d said Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, who got a scare in the Affordable Care Act-fueled backlash <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2010.</span> \u201cThat\u2019s been proven to me over and over again. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">And the driver won\u2019t be the tax cut vote.</span> It\u2019ll be the unpopularity of the president.\u201d<br><br><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">There is also scant evidence large-scale tax bills offer much in the way of a political lift.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Republicans suffered losses <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1982,</span> a year after President Reagan\u2019s first tax bill, and <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1986,</span> just a few months after Congress passed the last tax overhaul.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">The 2002 gains</span> by Republicans were more the result of a rallying around the commander-in-chief in the months after the attacks of <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Sept 11,</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2001,</span> than the tax cuts that the party passed a year earlier.<br><br></span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Obama\u2019s economic stimulus plan <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2009 included</span> tax cuts that went straight into paychecks \u2014 and were hardly noticed ahead of the Republican Tea Party tidal wave <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span><br><br></span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Complicating matters for Republicans, some of their House seats that are most in jeopardy are in high-income and high-tax states where many voters will feel little benefit from a bill that limits mortgage interest deductions and state and local tax write-offs.</span> Eleven of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 House</span> Republicans who opposed the bill hail from California, New York and New Jersey, most of them from affluent districts that are already uneasy with Mr. Trump.<br><br><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cI think each individual congressman will be judged on how they voted,\u201d said Representative Dan Donovan, the only Republican who represents New York City, who opposed the measure because of the limitations on local tax deductions.</span> \u201cThe voters will know how hard we fought.\u201d<br><br>Yet as the fallout from the Affordable Care Act demonstrated <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010,</span> when half of <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 34 House</span> Democrats who opposed the measure still lost their re-election, opposing a controversial bill is not enough to inoculate lawmakers in wave election years.<br><br><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe wave starts in those districts whether they voted for or against the tax bill,\u201d said former Democratic Representative Steve Israel of New York, calling this moment \u201cpolitical d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d<br><br></span>Notably, the House Republicans who opposed the bill also will not be the beneficiaries of the Super PAC\u2019s spending.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on those who kept their promise to their constituents,\u201d said Corry Bliss, who runs the group.<br><br>Veteran Republicans are sober about how <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">daunting 2018 is</span> shaping up to be, and hope that a clash on taxes at the very least offers the prospect of shifting the political debate onto more favorable terrain.<br><br><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican and you think about what\u2019s coming, and the range of things you could be fighting about, to have a fight about this tax bill is among the better things they can fight over <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span>\u201d said Bill McInturff, a G.O.P. pollster, conceding that Republicans are facing \u201cvery tough numbers.\u201d<br><br>Mr. McInturff, who recently conducted a survey showing Republicans trailing Democrats <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 12 points</span> on the so-called generic ballot, said his party could not change the minds of those with fixed views about Mr. Trump, but that the tax bill offered an argument for those willing to hear them out.<br><br></span>\u201cYou better have something to say that <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 60 percent</span> is willing to listen to,\u201d he said, noting polls that <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">show 40 percent</span> of voters want to impeach Mr. Trump.<br><br>Mr. Stivers acknowledged the partisan preferences of voters at the moment were tilting away from Republicans. \u201cRight now there are people that don\u2019t like the president, and they\u2019re expressing it in that way,\u201d he said of the generic ballot. But he suggested that voters uneasy with the president are still willing to support Republican congressional candidates, pointing to the Atlanta-area special House election the party won earlier this year despite a massive influx of money for the Democrats.<br><br>And he said he had urged his members to make taxes central. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cEverybody needs to be talking about the tax bill, what it means for their communities,\u201d said Mr. Stivers.<br><br></span>Democrats, though, said no piece of legislation could address the depth of the Republican challenge.<br><br>\u201cIt is unfixable,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd by November, tax reform could be a nonissue because what\u2019s driving people to come out to vote is they don\u2019t like the way the country is being run and the comportment of the president.</span>\u201dContinue reading the main story", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the US economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 14s "}}

Live Updates<br><br>American employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate as a resurgent coronavirus and the absence of new federal aid take a toll on economic growth.<br><br></span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department reported Thursday <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 886,000 Americans</span> filed new claims for unemployment benefits

available.<br><br><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The lack of fresh data from California makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, but the latest numbers \u201cpoint to a lot of churn in the labor

make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election.<br><br></span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Speaking on CNBC, the Treasury secretary said that he would agree to the language that Democrats had insisted on when it came to a coronavirus testing program and noted that the two sides had already agreed to spend an <span

week.<br><br></span>But significant hurdles remain in reaching a deal, including Republican resistance to what the White House is willing to support.
