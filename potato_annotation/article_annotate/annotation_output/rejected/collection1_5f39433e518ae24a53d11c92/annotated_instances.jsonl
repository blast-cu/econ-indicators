Powell said policymakers needed to focus on restoring maximum employment.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">As some prominent economists fret that the government might overdo its pandemic response and prompt prices to shoot higher, the nation\u2019s top inflation fighter has a countermessage: Policymakers should stay focused on restoring full employment.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cGiven the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the postpandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said in speech to the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday.</span> \u201cIt will require a societywide commitment.\u201d\nMr. Powell called policies that would bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end as soon as possible \u201cparamount\u201d and said both workers and businesses that had been disrupted by the crisis \u201care likely to need continued support.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Unemployment remains sharply elevated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 6.3 percent</span>, up <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 3.5 percent</span> before the pandemic, and jumps to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span> when adjusted for misclassified job statuses and recent dropouts from the work force.\n</span>The pain has also been uneven. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Employment has dropped <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 4 percent</span> for workers earning high wages but \u201ca <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">staggering 17 percent</span>\u201d for the bottom quartile of earners, Mr. Powell pointed out.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Separately, he noted that \u201cinflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times,\u201d and later added that he did not expect it to accelerate in a sustained way coming out of the pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Economists have often treated high employment and low inflation as conflicting goals.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Policies that foster strong demand and pull workers back into the labor market can push up wages as businesses compete for talent, prompting them to raise prices both because they need to pass along their rising costs and because eager consumers will accept such increases \u2014 at least in theory.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But the arithmetic has shifted in recent decades, as annual inflation remained stuck below the Fed\u2019<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2 percent</span> goal even during long periods of very low joblessness.\n</span>President Biden and top Democrats are moving quickly to try to approve <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.9 billion</span> pandemic relief package. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But some economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, have warned that the large package could touch off long-dormant price increases.</span> Many Republican lawmakers have also cited that risk as a reason to oppose the package.\nMr. Powell did not weigh in on the package specifically, but he did seem to rebut many of those concerns. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He and his colleagues have been unusually vocal in pushing for more fiscal support for the economy throughout the coronavirus era, with some saying the bigger risk is doing too little rather than doing too much.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to get into what is clearly a very active debate,\u201d Mr. Powell said when asked specifically about fiscal policy.</span> But he added that \u201cit is the essential tool for this situation.\u201d\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s own policies are set to stimulate growth.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The central bank cut interest rates to near zero in March and has been buying <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $120 billion</span> in government-backed bonds per month.</span> It aims to keep borrowing cheap and credit flowing to companies and households.\nLow rates are likely to stay for a long time. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell and his colleagues said last year that they would worry only about too little employment, not about too much, and would shoot for periods of slightly higher inflation, aiming to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">average 2 percent</span> over time.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Officials have been clear that they plan to look past a pop in inflation that is expected to occur this year without lifting borrowing costs to cool off the economy.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Inflation is measured by taking the cost of a basket of consumer goods and services and comparing it to the cost of the same products a year earlier.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Prices that dropped sharply in some categories at the start of the pandemic \u2014 think plane tickets, hotel stays and work clothes \u2014 are returning to more normal levels.</span> That means the measure will spike mechanically in relation to the <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">depressed 2020 months</span>.\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \u203a\nLet Us Help You Better Understand the Coronavirus\n- Are coronavirus case counts rising in your region? Our maps will help you determine how your state, county or country is faring.\n- Vaccines are rolling out and will reach many of us by spring. We\u2019ve answered some common questions about the vaccines.\n- Now that we are all getting used to living in a pandemic, you may have new questions about how to go about your routine safely, how your children will be impacted, how to travel and more. We\u2019re answering those questions as well.\n- So far, the coronavirus outbreak has sickened more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 106 million</span> people globally. More than two million people have died. A timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Some economists have warned that a rapid bounce-back in consumer demand fueled by big federal relief packages could push prices higher.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Americans have amassed substantial savings as social distancing policies keep them out of restaurants and malls and as government stimulus checks pad their bank accounts.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">They might spend that money once lockdowns lift even as supply remains constrained; for instance, vacation demand might rebound even with airlines still flying fewer daily routes.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Less clear is whether such a surge would amount to a one-time bounce or a sustained increase that causes consumers and businesses to expect ever-rising prices.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials seem to be betting on the former.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">While prices have shot up temporarily in recent decades, inflation has largely been benign and even a little bit too low for comfort across much of the developed world.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of savings on people\u2019s balance sheets, there is monetary policy, there is fiscal policy \u2014 you could see strong spending growth, and there could be some upward pressure on prices there,\u201d Mr. Powell said Wednesday.</span> \u201cAgain though, my expectation would be that that will be neither large nor sustained.\u201d\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Fed officials have gone so far as to suggest that if a large fiscal stimulus causes prices to rise sooner rather than later, that would be a welcome development.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Central bankers can lift interest rates to control price increases, but it is less clear that they have the tools to reinvigorate price gains on their own.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">A little bit of inflation acts like grease on the wheels of the economy: It may help employers raise wages and allow businesses to adjust to a changing environment, and it leaves the Fed with more room to cut interest rates in a future recession or slowdown.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said during a speech last week, \u201cIt will be critical for monetary policymakers to look through temporary price increases and not even think about thinking about adjusting policy until the economic criteria we have laid out have been realized.\u201d\n</span>Advertisement", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}

On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach\u2019s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.\n\nMr. Parker denies his company\u2019s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.\n\nMr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker\u2019s Kitchen chain <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family\u2019s assets are frozen. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl\u2019s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n</span>\u201cI\u2019ve <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I\u2019m really, really proud of,\u201d Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won\u2019t settle the case, because to settle would be \u201cto have Parker\u2019s name besmirched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with America now,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should stand up for what\u2019s right. And I\u2019m standing up for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.\n\nThe litigation so far hasn\u2019t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family\u2019s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.\n\n</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker\u2019s team improperly plied a boat passenger\u2019s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker\u2019s team and a crisis communications firm.\n\nMr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker \u201cfor everything he\u2019s got\u201d because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker\u2019s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.\n\n\u201cI can prove everything he did and I\u2019m going to, and he\u2019s going to write me a big check,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said.\n\nPower in county\n\nThe boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh\u2019s alleged financial wrongdoing.\n\n</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor\u2019s, or district attorney\u2019s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family\u2019s close working relationship with local law enforcement.\n\nBefore he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.\n\nBased on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span>\n\nIn the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 7,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh\u2019s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The state\u2019s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides \u201cthe background and the motive\u201d for the double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not responsible.\u201d\n\nMr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul\u2019s slight build didn\u2019t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother\u2019s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.\n\n\u201cWhen you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don\u2019t even read the information on the ID, it\u2019s apparent what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren\u2019t rigorously followed at Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.\n\n</span>Night of drinking\n\nThe fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span>\n\nPaul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker\u2019s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III\u2019s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.\n\nVideo footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver\u2019s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $49 on</span> his mother\u2019s credit card.\n\nAfter Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.\n\nThe six young people met at Paul\u2019s grandfather\u2019s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast\u2014a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry\u2014at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.\n\nOn the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn\u2019t have running lights. Just <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.\n\nSeveral passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, \u201cscreaming, cussing and saying horrible things,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn\u2019t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.\n\nIt took a week to find Ms. Beach\u2019s body, which was facedown in the <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.\n\nPaul\u2019s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.\n\nMr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory\u2019s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 29,</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker\u2019s company.\n\nThe hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.\n\nAlex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach\u2019s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.\n\nThat left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.\n\nThe wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nQuirk in liability law\n\nMr. Parker,<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and \u201cChewy Ice,\u201d which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.\n\nAs Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh\u2019s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh\u2019s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.\n\nMs. Cohen \u201ctakes the driver\u2019s license,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cShe looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.\u201d Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother\u2019s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker\u2019s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach\u2019s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn\u2019t follow other company policies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got great written policies,\u201d Mr. Tinsley said. \u201cIf they did what they said they were going to do, I don\u2019t think this happens.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.\n\nMs. Cohen isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.\n\nAlcohol-enforcement authorities haven\u2019t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen \u201cdid her due diligence,\u201d by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">State law doesn\u2019t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.\n\n</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018Well, wait a minute. If I\u2019m one-millionth <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">held 100% liable</span>?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. \u201cHow does that work? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.\n\nThe law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.\n\nIn December<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nMr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker\u2019s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.\n\nMr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker\u2019s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.\n\nSuper Bowl party\n\nRhett Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.\n\nWhen asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, \u201cNot that she knows of.\u201d He added, \u201cThey had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he can\u2019t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said \u201cwe sure as heck wouldn\u2019t have directed anybody to break the law,\u201d including by buying alcohol for someone underage.\n\nMr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker\u2019s investigation wouldn\u2019t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn\u2019t the cause of the boat crash. \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Parker\u2019s side was \u201ccollecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Mr. Parker\u2019s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.\n\nThe suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for \u201cMurdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,\u201d a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.\n\nMs. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that \u201cwhoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules\u201d and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.\n\nMr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn\u2019t seek the family\u2019s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.\n\nIn December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.\n\nEdward Fenno, Ms. Ward\u2019s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward\u2019s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.\n\nThe completed \u201cMurdaugh Murders\u201d documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn\u2019t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach\u2019s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker\u2019s legal team but haven\u2019t made public.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to find out who and what we were up against,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\nMr. Parker said he didn\u2019t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn\u2019t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach\u2019s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker\u2019s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.\n\nMr. Roman published <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward\u2019s documentary. Mr. Parker\u2019s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman\u2019s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker\u2019s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.\n\nMr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were \u201cengaged to gather information for news purposes\u201d and not part of a conspiracy.\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh\u2019s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer\u2019s double homicide.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on this [investigation], do I think \u2018Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn\u2019t have done that?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m proud of the work we did.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. \u201cHere\u2019s a better question,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018So what?\u2019 Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, \u201cwhich was pretty easy to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThis life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.\n\nThe outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker\u2019s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers say <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.\n\nMr. Donehue\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker\u2019s team in the spring <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,\u201d Ms. Senn said in an email. \u201cI hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.\n\nMr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.\n\nLayers of connections\n\nSome of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina\u2019s close-knit legal community.\n\nMr. Tinsley,<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh\u2019s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden\u2019s ambassador to Slovenia.\n\nMr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group\u2014unrelated to Mr. Parker\u2014including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s team includes some of the state\u2019s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nMr. Parker\u2019s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook\u2019s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach\u2019s boyfriend and Mr. Cook\u2019s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.\n\nIn a preview of Mr. Parker\u2019s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj \u201cP.K.\u201d Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker\u2019s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach\u2019s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn\u2019t, according to depositions.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.\n\n</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cHe said I\u2019m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of J\u00e4germeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I\u2019m responsible?\u201d\n\nJoe McCulloch, Mr. Cook\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. \u201cMutiny on the Bounty wouldn\u2019t have ended well for anybody,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said.\n\nSouth Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn\u2019t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cVery few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said. \u201cHis willingness to point the finger isn\u2019t surprising.\u201d\n\nMr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker\u2019s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He said he was dropped by his longtime insurer after the boat crash and <span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">went 10 months</span> without insurance before finding a carrier, which offered him less coverage and charged a higher price.\n\n</span>Tom Mullikin, a lawyer who is leading Mr. Parker\u2019s South Carolina Coalition for Lawsuit Reform, said he knows he faces an uphill climb. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">He said the South Carolina trade associations for restaurants and convenience stores have expressed support but not yet joined the effort to change the law.\n\n</span>The president of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association said in an email the association generally supported changes to tort law and was \u201clooking into how the association would fit in\u201d with the coalition\u2019s work. The South Carolina Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA bill Mr. Parker backed in the legislative session that ended in June didn\u2019t get a hearing at the judiciary subcommittee level. In the legislature,<span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 54 of</span><span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 170 members</span> are lawyers, and a disproportionate number are trial lawyers who oppose changing the law, according to Mr. Mullikin.\n\nState Sen. Luke Rankin, the chair of the judiciary committee and a personal-injury lawyer, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate significant movement on the bill, saying it doesn\u2019t benefit the public.\n\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the August<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13,</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'Teens, Alcohol and a Crash: Case Shakes South Carolina'.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific [articles focused on a single business]": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}

This year, the problem got worse. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">In the April-to-June period, Exxon <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paid $3.1 billion</span> in dividends and had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just $1.7 billion</span> in net income, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.</span> <span id=\"6\"

more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $400 million</span> across a range of energy funds, including shares in Exxon, BP, Chevron and Shell.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The oil companies say they have many tools to deploy to help defray debt, including selling assets and offering shareholders more shares instead of a cash dividend, as well as continuing to cut costs.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Record-low interest rates are helping ease some of the pain.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They also say the steep levels of debt are temporary as the companies restructure, and the debt will fall when oil prices rise.\n</span>\u2018These companies won\u2019t be able to maintain the current dividends <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\"

analysts and investors say the oil slump is making it harder than ever for companies to raise money with asset sales to pay off debt.</span> Handing out more shares to shareholders is only storing up the dividend problem for the future when the companies will need to pay up. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Even the boost many companies got from bumper profits from their refining divisions\u2014which tend to do well when prices are low\u2014looks to be coming to an end as a glut of gasoline erodes fuel prices, say investors and analysts.\n</span>Still, some funds see BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron

Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.\nOnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China\u2019s growing market.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">China currently consumes <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world\u2019s supply of the product, according to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 20 gallons</span>\u2014or <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles\u2014a year, and analysts expect the country\u2019s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.\n</span>Water resources within China are limited.

water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.\n</span>Four of <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The country\u2019s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2013 and</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade data.\n</span>New Zealand has become an attractive destination for Chinese companies that want to use the country\u2019s environmentally pristine image to sell bottled water. A few years ago, the country\u2019s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country\u2019s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2016,</span> Nongfu\u2019s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country\u2019s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.\nThe plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community\u2019s own needs.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,\u201d it said.\n</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand\u2019s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean\u2019s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe need to protect our water supply for our community,\u201d said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t the potential for such growth in demand\u2026no one would be panicking.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com\u2019s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.\n\u2014Zhou Wei in Shanghai contributed to this article.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Write to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}

{"id": "20435", "displayed_text": "<h3>Making Sense of the N.B.A.\u2019s Wacky Start</h3>It has taken an unusual amount of ink, focus, caffeine and pregame napping to stay on top of all the drama in the N.B.A. this season.\nWithout a running diary, it would be easy to forget that the Oklahoma City Thunder did not win their first game <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 days</span>, or that Blake Griffin <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">scored 50 points</span> against Philadelphia, or that Luke Walton\u2019s run with the Los Angeles Lakers as coach once seemed to be in its final days.\nOnly a fraction of the way through this season, a crew of New York Times sportswriters and friends are ready to reflect.\nHere are their early-season takeaways:\nThe Celtics were supposed to be better than this\nBy Sopan Deb\nThe Boston Celtics could have four first-rounders in next year\u2019s draft, from: the Kings (<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 1 protected</span>), the Grizzlies (1 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 8 protected</span>) and the Clippers (1 <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 14 protected</span>), plus their own. We are almost a quarter of the way through the season. Who would have thought that the Celtics would be on track to end up the highest pick of them all by season\u2019s end?\nI\u2019m being hyperbolic. But we\u2019re past the \u201cit\u2019s early\u201d stage to assess the team, and the results are disappointing. Boston lost at home against a terrible Knicks team. Before that, there was a blown double-digit, fourth-quarter lead against a tired Charlotte Hornets team. It\u2019s nothing short of baffling. One of their wins required an unlikely, otherworldly late comeback against an objectively bad Phoenix team. And it\u2019s not like the Celtics are the only team that has had to incorporate players into new roles.\nBrad Stevens\u2019s offense moves the ball well (in the top half of the league in assist percentage) and generates open looks with ease. It\u2019s not a lethargy thing, either: The players seem to like playing with one another and for Stevens. And besides, how do you have one of the league\u2019s best defenses without playing hard?\nBut the open looks just aren\u2019t falling, and neither are the shots around the paint, in the rare instances players actually try to go to the rim. The offense is designed to emphasize the shooting talent of the roster. Everyone has some semblance of a jumper. In today\u2019s N.B.A., this should, in theory, make for a lethal offense. Early on, it was easy to say the bricks were a bug, not a feature. Now you have to wonder if there\u2019s more going on here. Boston shoots <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 35 percent</span> on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, well below the league average.\nWhen the open looks have not fallen, Boston has not found alternatives. The Celtics are near the bottom of the league in drives to the rim per game, which you can get away with if the offense is hitting its jumpers, which it\u2019s not. And when the ball finds its way into the paint, in the restricted area, the Celtics <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shoot 61 percent</span>, also below mediocre.\nAnd then there\u2019s Gordon Hayward, who clearly still needs time. I expected his explosiveness to the rim to need the time, not his 3-point shooting, which is mired <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 28 percent</span>. The lesson: Don\u2019t trust all those off-season workout videos you see of players swishing shots.\nSo those are the worrying signs. The positives? The talent is there. And this is with Kyrie Irving playing some of the best ball of his career. After a slow start, he is shooting <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 percent</span> from the field and is <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 10 in</span> real plus-minus. Jayson Tatum is pulling out of his slump, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">shooting 45 percent</span> from the field in November, compared <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 40 percent</span> in October. You have to believe that Jaylen Brown is better than <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 40 percent</span> he is shooting from the field.\nBoston has pulled out some big wins against other Eastern Conference powers: Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. I\u2019m still betting on Boston to go to the N.B.A. finals because Stevens is a master at adjustments and, frankly, in this league, talented players in their prime win. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">But if the mediocrity continues, I have to wonder if Danny Ainge will end up regretting not moving more aggressively to trade Brown for Kawhi Leonard.\n</span>And the biggest positive: Look at all those draft picks next year, if things don\u2019t work out!\nCalifornia is once again the wild, wild West\nBy Scott Cacciola\nThe N.B.A.\u2019s California contingent has gone mad. The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are dealing with \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 some dysfunction. The Los Angeles Lakers and their cast of misfit toys are suddenly surging behind the one and only LeBron James. The Los Angeles Clippers, whom few expected to even vie for a playoff spot, are shaping up as one of the more dangerous teams in the Western Conference. And the Sacramento Kings \u2014 well, at least the Kings are still the Kings, reportedly rived by front-office drama.\nOut here in California, where I relocated for the season, up is down, left is right and not a whole lot makes sense, starting with the Warriors, whom I visited toward the end of October. At the time, their season was going well, which was no surprise. I wrote about how they were having lots of fun, months removed from a championship season that apparently had its share of behind-the-scenes agita. But they were enjoying themselves again, and get this: Draymond Green said he had made it a goal to stop complaining to the referees so much.\nMy article did not age well. A kinder, gentler Green proceeded to blow up in Kevin Durant\u2019s face earlier this month, and the fallout has been something to behold. The Warriors have lost a bunch of games. Stephen Curry has been sidelined with an injury. And questions continue to swirl about Durant\u2019s future with the team, with free agency looming this summer.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that no one could have predicted this sort of drama playing out in Oakland. And while I would be shocked to see the Warriors continue to struggle \u2014 awesome talent tends to compensate for a multitude of sins \u2014 the past couple of weeks have illustrated the fragile nature of team chemistry, even when that team is an established superpower.\nSpeaking of superpowers, James is doing it again: elevating an odd collection of inexperienced players and reclamation projects into something that resembles a contender, or at least a competitive team. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Not so long ago, Rajon Rondo was trying to deck Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets, and Magic Johnson, the team president, was yelling at Coach Luke Walton, raising concerns about Walton\u2019s job security.</span> But the Lakers now look pretty cohesive compared with the Warriors, and who saw that coming?\nJames, of course, deserves a lot of the credit. <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Approaching 34 and</span> in his 16th season, he is playing some of the finest basketball of his career.\nThe Clippers, too, have been exciting to watch. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They have ferocious defenders and players who know their roles, and they are going about their business their own way: without a resident superstar, proving there might just be more than one way to win in the modern N.B.A.\nHold off on the hype (i.e., don\u2019t trust the process yet)\n</span>By Kevin Draper\nIt might not work for the Philadelphia 76ers. Jimmy Butler might bolt after the season. He might further erode Markelle Fultz\u2019s confidence. He might not be good enough to be the second-best player on a championship team.\nBut good for the 76ers for finally pushing their chips into the middle of the table and going for it.\nThis isn\u2019t an anti-Process rant, or at least not entirely one. It is a plea for a more realistic understanding of the typical development path and of how few young players actually become stars. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Every team eventually has a young player whom fans overhype, who is sure to be a star and whom the team refuses to trade.\n</span>For Golden State Warriors fans like me, that player was Anthony Randolph, who promised to be a hybrid of Lamar Odom and Kevin Garnett. In six N.B.A. seasons, Randolph started <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 43 games</span> and <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">averaged 7.1 points</span>. For Mavericks fans, that player was Rodrigue Beaubois. Declared \u201cuntouchable\u201d by Mark Cuban, he lasted four seasons in the league.\nFultz, Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum \u2014 the top three picks in last year\u2019s draft \u2014 are all struggling. So is Donovan Mitchell, the rookie of the year runner-up. At the same time, De\u2019Aaron Fox and Zach Collins are impressing after pedestrian rookie seasons.\nAll of this is to say that young players are tough to evaluate, and the overwhelming majority of them do not become stars. From <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2013 draft</span> there is Giannis Antetokounmpo and maybe Victor Oladipo. <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2014 there</span> is Joel Embiid. <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 2015 there</span> are none yet, unless you\u2019re willing to bet the farm on Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis.\nIf Philadelphia flames out in the playoffs, Butler leaves and Dario Saric turns into a star, the 76ers will look dumb. But the far greater sin is passing on the opportunity to acquire a star in the hope that your young player will develop into one.\nChristmas came early this year\nBy Marc Stein\nThe cynics will tell you there is little reason to follow the N.B.A. regular season. Not before Christmas, anyway.\nAs an N.B.A. addict, I love it when the cynics are forced to stuff it.\nWe\u2019re roughly one-fourth of the way into the 82-game schedule and the Golden State Warriors were on a very mortal 52-win pace entering Friday\u2019s play. They\u2019re hardly running away with things, as so many feared, and there has been a corresponding stream of surprises across the league.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">We might have already seen the biggest in-season blockbuster trade we\u2019re going to get with Jimmy Butler\u2019s Nov.<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 move</span> from Minnesota to Philadelphia.</span> We\u2019ve sadly seen Carmelo Anthony\u2019s stint as a Houston Rocket fizzle out faster than could be expected. And we\u2019ve seen an offensive eruption that has quickly generated five 50-point games \u2014 and a 60-pointer by Charlotte guard Kemba Walker \u2014 after <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 10 50</span>-point games total last season.\nThe big-picture geek in me, meanwhile, can\u2019t stop checking the standings every day \u2014 even at this early stage \u2014 because of the unforeseen chaos in both conferences.\nIn the resurgent East: Toronto, Milwaukee and Philadelphia are playing better than Boston, which means the Celtics will not be getting that supposed free pass to the N.B.A. finals. The unexpected battle for a top-four seeding \u2014 go ahead and throw the pesky Indiana Pacers into the conversation, too \u2014 has hushed the notion that this conference should just cease to exist after LeBron James\u2019s relocation to Hollywood.\nOut west, meanwhile, Portland, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers are overachieving, thus offsetting the so-so starts endured by the more established likes of Houston, Utah and San Antonio.\nThe rules haven\u2019t changed; only eight teams in each conference can advance to the playoffs. But take a look at the ever-deep West ladder and you\u2019ll see only one team <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15 </span>\u2014 Phoenix \u2014 that can be dismissed as noncompetitive.\nHow many wins is it going to take to secure a playoff berth in the West? Are we still sure that LeBron\u2019s Lakers will be one of those eight teams? Does the biggest threat to Golden State\u2019s bid for just the sixth three-peat in N.B.A. history \u2014 besides the Warriors themselves \u2014 reside in the West or the East?\nMaybe we\u2019ll be able to offer a clearer forecast on how to answer these nagging questions when we get to the regular-season midpoint in January.\nThen again, given the rampant script defiance we\u2019ve seen throughout #thisleague so far, maybe not.\nNew rule gives sneakerheads their due\nBy Kelly Whiteside\nWhen the N.B.A. changed its rule before the season allowing players to wear whatever color shoes they want, sneakerheads rejoiced. Six weeks into the season, this is what that the color change has wrought: In the season opener, Houston Rockets forward P.J. Tucker, the reigning \u201cSneaker Champ\u201d (there is such a thing), wore three different pairs. One was a black and purple Nike <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Kobe 1,</span> which he had signed by Kobe Bryant.\nA kaleidoscope of yellow ocher, Cinnamon Toast Crunch (part of Kyrie Irving\u2019s cereal pack) and green Grinch took center stage. Amid this color burst, there were floral patterns from a Chinese line, a pair inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and a shoe featuring a cartoon version of Rosa Parks on its heel \u2014 as if we needed more proof that the N.B.A. is much more fun than its stodgy pro counterparts.\nArguably the coolest line of kicks belongs to Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who will wear a different sneaker to every game. For the Nets\u2019 game against the 76ers on Sunday, he will debut his Creed shoe, a nod to Rocky\u2019s roots and the release of the movie \u201cCreed II.\u201d\nDinwiddie unveiled a media shoe, a sneaker close to our heart, in the Nets\u2019 home opener against the Knicks. It thanked news organizations for their hard work. (Really!) It featured the logos of ESPN, NBA TV, Bleacher Report, The New York Post and The New York Times among others.\nAgainst Detroit, he wore the shoes honoring Rosa Park. After the Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee died, Dinwiddie called an audible and helped design a tribute shoe. His brand, K8IROS, has honored other sports and entertainment legends, with sneakers inspired by Colin Kaepernick, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Allen Iverson and Jesse Owens, to be auctioned off for charity.\nSignature shoes have long been a benchmark of success in the league, but Dinwiddie thinks what he\u2019s doing \u2014 along with the loosened N.B.A. rules \u2014 may lead to even more fun on the court. \u201cIt would be dope to see everyone try their hand at it and express themselves the way they want to express themselves,\u201d he said.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Firm-specific [articles focused on a single business]": "1"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}

They achieved that up to a point. While worst-case loss rates look tough, certain loan portfolios -- in particular commercial real estate -- at some banks seem to have gotten off lightly. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, the tests' numbers for underlying earnings -- which are needed to offset soaring credit losses -- could turn out to be optimistic in some cases.\n\n</span>It is hard to quibble with most of the government's worst-case loss rates, which are calculated for this year and next. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">For example, <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.8% loss</span> rate for first-lien mortgages seems suitably tough, even when taking into account the aggressive underwriting during the housing bubble.</span> The government'<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 13.8% worst</span>-case loss-rate for second-lien mortgages seems fair. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But it is a stretch to think Wells Fargo <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">WFC 1.79</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle, with its large home-equity book focused on stressed housing markets, will have a lower-than-sector loss rate <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 13.2%.</span>\n\n</span>The government may have been too optimistic in positing <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.5% commercial</span>-real-estate loss rate. This sector is just starting to fall apart, and defaults may move sharply higher as borrowers struggle to refinance loans. BB&T's commercial-real-estate worst case is higher <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 12.6%,</span> but its portfolio may arguably show higher losses.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The government's earnings projections also need to be taken with a pinch of salt.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It is optimistic to assume banks can repeat their first-quarter revenue generation, for instance.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Given the Fed has unleashed a tidal wave of liquidity into the system, interest rates are going to be extremely volatile for several quarters, making bank revenue very hard to predict.\n\n</span>Another reason to be skeptical is few banks have to substantially increase overall levels of <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 1 capital</span>, which includes common and preferred shares, by raising new money. The government is effectively saying most large banks were solidly capitalized even when investors fled earlier this year.\n\nInstead of immediately raising overall capital levels, some banks are just shifting the mix toward common equity -- the highest-quality capital. Lenders that need to raise fresh money include GMAC, General Motors' lending arm. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Also, Wells Fargo's offering of common stock, announced Thursday, suggests its overall capital will increase.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Finally, the government has effectively said it wants banks to have <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Tier 1 common</span> stock equivalent <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% of</span> risk-weighted assets.</span> First, investors have to decide whether they have confidence in the risk weightings.\n\nSecond, Tier-1 measures of capital leave out certain unrealized losses on securities that could become real later -- something captured by tangible-common-equity ratios.\n\nThen they must decide <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">whether 4% </span>-- which still translates into 25-to-1 leverage -- is safe for the unpredictable environment we are in.\n\nWrite to Peter Eavis at peter.eavis@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}

Seeking to Keep Options Open\nThe minutes suggested a rate increase is a possibility as early as September\nWASHINGTON\u2014Federal Reserve officials, playing a waiting game on the economy, sought to keep their options open at a July policy meeting as they tried to reconcile differences over whether it was time to raise short-term interest rates again.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s Wednesday release of minutes from its July 26-27 meeting suggested a rate increase is a possibility as early as September, but that the Fed won\u2019t commit to moving until a stronger consensus can be reached about the outlook for growth, hiring and inflation.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Several officials, still not yet confident that inflation will rise to the Fed\u2019<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% objective</span> after running below target for four years, weren\u2019t prepared to consider a rate increase.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Others, believing the U.S. is close to a fully recovered job market, thought a rate increase would soon be warranted, according to the minutes.\n</span>\u201cMembers judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information,\u201d the minutes said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds interest rate from near zero in December, and began the year expecting to nudge rates up four more times in quarter-percentage-point increments <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span></span> It hasn\u2019t moved because of recurrent worries about growth, hiring and turbulence overseas.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Investors have doubts about the Fed\u2019s willingness to move again.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Futures traders place <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 18% probability</span> on a rate increase in September,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20% on</span> a move by November <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 50% on</span> a move by December.\nWSJ Pro In-Depth\nSeparate Subscription\nStocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar could all be jolted when the Fed does actually push rates up again, since borrowing costs affect so much in the economy\u2014including how much it takes to buy a home or car or finance a big corporate project.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Fed next meets Sept. 20-21.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Since its last meeting, economic data have been mixed.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Jobs data for July were strong\u2014payrolls <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 255,000</span>\u2014but retail sales and inflation indicators for the month were soft, leaving open the possibility of a prolonged Fed divide that could further delay the next rate move.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Despite the mixed economic backdrop, some notable officials this week have sought to remind investors that the time for another rate increase was drawing near.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cI think we\u2019re getting closer to the day where we\u2019re going to have to snug up interest rates a little bit.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">And that\u2019s good news,\u201d New York Fed President William Dudley, a close adviser to Chairwoman Janet Yellen, said on the Fox Business Network on Tuesday.</span> Dennis Lockhart, a middle-of-the-road official whose views often reflect the committee consensus, said Tuesday he wouldn\u2019t rule out a September move.\n\u201cMost of the fundamentals underpinning growth of consumption are pretty solid,\u201d Mr. Lockhart said. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\u201cEarly indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound,\u201d he added.</span> \u201cI don\u2019t believe momentum has stalled.\u201d\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Some of the Fed\u2019s worries have receded in recent weeks, including whether markets would convulse after Britain\u2019s June decision to leave the European Union.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cParticipants generally agreed that the prompt recovery of financial markets following the Brexit vote and the pickup in job gains in June had alleviated two key uncertainties about the outlook,\u201d the minutes said.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year, but several still harbor doubt, especially because inflation has run below the Fed\u2019s target for so long.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in July and <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.9% from</span> a year earlier.</span> The previous three months it was <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 1.1% from</span> a year earlier.\nThe central bank divided into three camps at its July meeting, the minutes show: those who aren\u2019t ready to move rates up, those who are ready, and those who say the moment is getting closer.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Several officials \u201cpreferred to defer another rate increase in the federal-funds rate until they were more confident that inflation was moving closer <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2 percent</span> on a sustained basis,\u201d the minutes said.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Others believed the U.S. was \u201cat or close\u201d to full employment, meaning a state where unemployment was low, fully recovered from recession and at a point where if it falls much more it could cause more inflation.</span> These people believed a rate increase \u201cwas or would soon be warranted.\u201d\n\u201cBy far the most significant part of the minutes was the point, repeated at least twice, that (official) forecasts had changed little during the intermeeting period,\u201d Roberto Perli, an analyst with Cornerstone Macro Advisers, said in a note to clients.\nBack in June they all expected to raise rates this year. If none of them changed their forecast in a material way, it must mean they still see a rate hike this year as appropriate, he said. \u201cA move by December was and remains a good base case,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some Fed officials also worried that a prolonged period of very low rates could cause investors to misallocate investments or misprice risk, possibly leading to a destabilizing financial bubble and bust.\n</span>Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "3"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. macroeconomic / general economic conditions": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}

about Longfin shine a light on the apparent ease with which IPOs are being approved under the Reg A+ regime, lawyers said. \u201cEveryone understood we were rationalizing the disclosures [required] but nothing as flimsy as what appears to have happened here,\u201d said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look back on Reg A+ and think this was an experiment that didn\u2019t get managed very well.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The SEC gave Longfin the green light to sell shares based on one month\u2019s audited financial statements, which showed

is \u201cbased out of Dubai\u201d but intends to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spend 15 days</span> a month in the U.S. He said its sole U.S. office space\u2014a small room with three desks and no computers in a shared-office building in downtown Manhattan that was deserted at 9:30 on a recent weekday morning\u2014is temporary. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Longfin plans to open a bigger office in New York and is hiring more U.S. employees, he added.\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Meenavalli rejects any suggestion of financial

The image is then transferred to a printer, which creates a three-dimensional object by producing each layer in plastic, metal, sand or other materials.\n\nRetailers <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">sell $1,500 3</span>-D printers that can make toys and jewelry. More advanced printers, selling <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $500,000 each</span>, make metal pump parts for the U.S. Navy, titanium knee joints and plastic ear pieces for hearing aids. Ford Motor Co. engineers use 3-D printers to make some prototype parts.\n\n\"Every week, if not every day, somebody walks into my office and says: 'You should be 3-D printing this out of that material,\" said Mr. Burns, a Rochester, N.Y., native, who managed machine shops before helping launch ExOne <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2005 here</span> in western Pennsylvania. \"It's easy to get distracted.<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nStock prices for some 3-D printing companies more than doubled <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> while world-wide revenue increased a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">smaller 27% to</span> an <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $2.8 billion</span> last year, according to consultancy Wohlers Associates Inc. in Colorado.</span> 3-D stocks though are off to a rough start this year with industry leaders 3D Systems Corp. <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DDD 1.66</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 40% and</span> Stratasys Ltd.

But the printers aren't yet capable of an industrial revolution.\"\n\nHe and other analysts say the printers need to be faster and cheaper to replace traditional techniques that cut, stamp, grind or cast metal into finished objects.\n\nThe biggest current advantage of 3-D printers: flexibility and complexity. ExOne's printers made a pump impeller for the Navy as a single unit, the company said. Before, it was assembled <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 13 parts</span>.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">ExOne is pursuing a risky industrial-only strategy focused on making metal objects\u2014no plastic\u2014in a bet that it will dominate a market for metal printers that is still in its infancy.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\"They've got an attractive position in the [metal printer] market, but the question is will metals be an attractive market to have an attractive position in,\" said Holden Lewis, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets.\n\n</span>Although ExOne does have some big customers, including Caterpillar Inc. and United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky helicopter unit.<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">, its sales last year <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $39.5 million</span>, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 38% increase</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2012.</span></span> Heavy expenses for production and technology development contributed to <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $6.5 million</span> loss last year, an improvement from <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $10.2 million</span> loss <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The company'<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s $500 million</span> market capitalization is dwarfed by <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $5.7 billion</span> market cap for bigger rivals 3-D Systems <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $5.4 billion</span> for Stratasys.\n\n</span>ExOne printers use silica sand for creating molds for metal castings or powdered metal, such as stainless steel or bronze, that are mixed with a glue-type binder to hold the particles together. The printer applies layer after layer during hours of production work. Once printed, the metal object goes into <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2,300</span>-degree furnace where metal particles are melted together.\n\nFord uses ExOne printers in design centers in North America and Europe to make molds for prototype engine and transmission parts, including the engine block for Ford's popular EcoBoost engine. It takes four days and <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs $3,000 to</span> print a 3-D prototype of an engine's air intake manifold, compared to four months <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $500,000 without</span> 3-D printing. Prototyped parts with 3-D printing can be easily enlarged or reduced by fractions of an inch and printed again.\n\n\"You're offering engineers a lot more flexibility\" with their component designs, said Harold Sears, additive manufacturing specialist at Ford. Printers can't yet produce finished parts in large enough volumes to install in cars and light trucks.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">3-D is making inroads in the market for hard-to-find replacement parts.</span> Contract manufacturer rp+m in Avon Lake, Ohio, uses an ExOne printer to make replacement parts from powdered tungsten for medical-imaging machines built by General Electric Co., Siemens AG and Philips NV. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">In many cases, the original suppliers have gone out of business and replacements parts must be built from scratch, usually in small quantities.\n\n</span>\"Companies order exactly what they need,\" said Matt Hlavin, chief executive of rp+m, which <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 13 3</span>-D printers made by multiple companies.\n\nSome 3-D customers want printed parts but aren't ready to invest in the printers themselves. Hydro Parts Solutions Inc. makes replacement parts for pumps and other equipment at oil refineries and chemical plants. \"The pumps are so old that no one has replacement parts for them,\" said co-owner Jeff Smith.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">His engineers create digital images of the broken or worn part and send it electronically to one of ExOne's seven job shops.</span> There, the printer creates a mold, which has as many <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 11,000 layers</span>, in less <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 24 hours</span>. The mold is used to cast a new metal part. In the past, this process took more than six weeks and the resulting molds weren't as precise and detailed.\n\n\"You can control the shape much better with 3-D,\" said Mr. Smith who ran a foundry <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 20 years</span> before launching Hydro Parts.\n\nWrite to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}

{"id": "22778", "displayed_text": "<h3>Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming</h3>HOUSTON \u2014 A surge of oil production is coming, whether the world needs it or not.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The flood of crude will arrive even as concerns about climate change are growing and worldwide oil demand is slowing.</span> And it is not coming from the usual producers, but from Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana \u2014 countries that are either not known for oil or whose production has been lackluster in recent years.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">This looming new supply may be a key reason Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant oil producer, Aramco, pushed ahead on Sunday with plans for what could be the world\u2019s largest initial stock offering ever.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Together, the four countries stand to add nearly a million barrels a day to the market <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 and</span> nearly a million more <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> on top of the current world crude output <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 80 million</span> barrels a day.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">That boost in production, along with global efforts to lower emissions, will almost certainly push oil prices down.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Lower prices could prove damaging for Aramco and many other oil companies, reducing profits and limiting new exploration and drilling, while also reshaping the politics of the nations that rely on oil income.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The new rise in production is likely to bring economic relief to consumers at the gas pump and to importing nations like China, India and Japan.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But cheaper oil may complicate efforts to combat global warming and wean consumers and industries off their dependence on fossil fuels, because lower gasoline prices could, for example, slow the adoption of electric vehicles.\n</span>Canada, Norway, Brazil and Guyana are all relatively stable at a time of turbulence for traditional producers like Venezuela and Libya and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Their oil riches should undercut efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to support prices with cuts in production and give American and other Western policymakers an added cushion in case there are renewed attacks on oil

Yergin, the energy historian who wrote \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Power and Money,\u201d compared the impact of the new production to the advent of the shale oil boom in Texas and North Dakota a decade ago.\n\u201cSince all four of these countries are largely insulated from traditional geopolitical turmoil, they will add to global energy security,\u201d Mr. Yergin said. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But he also predicted that as with shale, the incremental supply gain, combined with a sluggish world economy, could drive prices lower.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">There is already a glut on the world market, even with exports from Venezuela and Iran sharply curtailed by American sanctions.</span> Should their production come back, that glut would only expand.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Years of moderate gasoline prices have already increased the popularity of bigger cars and sports utility vehicles in the United States, and the probability of more oil on the market is bound to weigh on prices at the pump over the next few years.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The oil-supply outlook is a sharp departure from the early 2000s, when prices soared as producers strained to keep up with ballooning demand in China and some analysts warned that the world was running out of oil.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Then came the rise of hydraulic fracturing and drilling through tight shale fields, which converted the United States from a needy importer into a powerful exporter.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The increase in

for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.\n</span>\u201cThis could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,\u201d said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics.</span> Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.\nProduction of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.\n\u201cLegacy decisions keep going,\u201d said John Browne, BP\u2019s former chief executive. \u201cThings happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.\u201d\nThe added production in Norway comes despite the country\u2019s embrace of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 Paris</span> climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.\nEquinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, \u201cThe Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s rebound <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 19 years</span> of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">produce 440,000 barrels</span> a day, increasing the country\u2019s output <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1.3 million</span> barrels a day <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.6 million</span> next year <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 1.8 million</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021.</span></span>\nIn Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 300,000 barrels</span> a day, and the country is expected to add as much <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 460,000 more</span> barrels a day by the end <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021.</span> In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 15 billion</span> barrels of reserves.\nIn Canada, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,000</span>-mile <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Line 3 pipeline</span> that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10 percent</span>.\nAnd the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reach 120,000 barrels</span> a day early next year, rising to at <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 750,000 barrels</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2025,</span> and more is expected after that.\nGuyana potentially has the most complicated future of the four countries. Its ethnically divided politics are sometimes turbulent, and Venezuela claims a large portion of its territory. But with the oil fields miles offshore, drilling is largely protected. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">In addition, Venezuela is mired in a political and economic crisis and unlikely to challenge a Chinese state company which has an oil investment in Guyana, along with Exxon Mobil and Hess.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Energy experts say the new production from the four nations will more than satisfy all the growth in global demand expected over the next two years, which is well below the growth rates of recent years before economic expansion in China, Europe and Latin America slowed.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">At the same time, new pipelines in Texas are expected to increase United States exports <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3.3 million</span> barrels a day next year, from the <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">current 2.8 million</span>.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">That adds up to a vast surplus unless there is a resurgence of global economic growth to stimulate demand, or a prolonged conflict in the Middle East or other disruption to supply.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo support prices, OPEC is going to have to extend and probably deepen their production cuts for a while,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, a top State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cGetting the prices up to the point where Aramco can launch its I.P.O. is a big Saudi priority.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The new barrels on the world market will also put pressure on companies producing in the United States, where profit margins for shale production are slim at current price levels and stock prices are falling.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf I was in the business I would be scared to death,\u201d said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.</span> \u201cThe industry is going to face capital starvation.\u201d\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">American oil executives express concern that drilling will fade in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado as oil prices drop to as low <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $50 a</span> barrel in the next few years.</span> Small companies are expected to merge, while others go bankrupt.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u2018This Is the Most Lonesome Job\u2019: Ride With a \u2018Hot Shot\u2019 Oilfield Trucker in Texas\nAs the United States has become the world\u2019s largest producer of oil, demand in the fields has soared for pipes or drums in a hurry.</span> That\u2019s where Mike Wilkinson fits in.\nScott D. Sheffield, chief executive of the Texas-based producer Pioneer Natural Resources, said he expected the growth of United States oil production to ease <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1.2 million</span> barrels a day this year <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 500,000 barrels</span> next year and <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">perhaps 400,000 barrels</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021.</span></span> Those increases are modest compared with the average increase of a million barrels a day every year <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2010 to</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018.</span>\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Sheffield said he was optimistic, in part because new supplies coming to market could be offset by production declines in older fields in Mexico and elsewhere <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 2021.</span>\n</span>\u201cThere are no more big, giant new projects except Guyana,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to be patient for a couple of more years.\u201d", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Industry-specific [articles focused on multiple/all businesses within a single sector e.g. the steel industry]": "2"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}

id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 3</span>:33 pm ET\n\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s decision Thursday to lower its key interest rate further below zero while relaunching an asset-purchase program means monetary policy in Europe is now even more stimulative than in the U.S.\n\nThat prompted a strong response from President Trump, who complained in a tweet that the ECB is weakening the euro against the U.S. dollar and thus \u201churting U.S. exports,\u201d while the Federal Reserve \u201csits, and sits, and sits.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Fed cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point in July and is poised to do so again next week, which would lower the rate to a range <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%.</span></span> That would be well above the ECB\u2019s key rate, which will drop to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">minus 0.5%.</span>\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Behind this divergence: The U.S. economy is stronger than the eurozone\u2019s, which means there is less reason for the Fed to boost growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s not an enviable situation to be in to have negative interest rates,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cEurope has negative rates because the economy is weak.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Here are five charts that highlight the differences in the two economies.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Economic Growth\n\nFirst, overall economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe since mid-2017.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">While growth faltered in the eurozone beginning in the first quarter <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2018,</span> it has remained solid in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nA central bank\u2019s main job is to maintain slow and steady inflation to keep the economy humming along.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The Fed targets <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2% rate</span> while the ECB seeks a level close to but just under<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%.</span></span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Inflation has been weak in both economies lately but it has come closer to the Fed\u2019s goal.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Manufacturing\n\nThe global economic slowdown has had a bigger effect on manufacturing in the eurozone, which is more export-driven.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">That has contributed to Europe\u2019s weakening economy and helped spur the ECB\u2019s latest move.\n\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Borrowing Costs\n\nFaced with the sluggish economy, European investors are seeking safety in European government bonds, pushing up their prices.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">That, combined with the large portfolio the ECB has accumulated through its asset purchases, has pulled yields in several eurozone countries into negative territory, well below the yield on U.S. government debt.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Currencies\n\nThe stronger U.S. economy has attracted investment from overseas.</span> That has pushed up the value of the dollar against other currencies, including the euro.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">President Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more to weaken the dollar, which would benefit American exporters.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He pressed the Fed in a tweet Wednesday to cut short-term rates to \u201c\u201cZERO, or less.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But the relatively solid U.S. economy means that could be risky.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">It could cause the economy to overheat and inflate dangerous asset bubbles that might burst and harm the economy.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this month the U.S. economy \u201cis in a good place,\u201d adding that the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to keep the expansion going.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">But the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience means the Fed is unlikely to push rates below zero soon.\n\n</span>Write to

On Saturday, officials <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 793 additional</span> deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting pandemic.\nThe government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in Lombardy, the northern region at the center of the outbreak, where bodies have piled up in churches. On Friday night, the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.\nThe tragedy of Italy now stands as a warning to its European neighbors and the United States, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. If Italy\u2019s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion \u2014 when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.\n</span>Italy\u2019s piecemeal attempts to cut it off \u2014 isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown \u2014 always lagged behind the virus\u2019s lethal trajectory.\n\u201cNow we are running after it,\u201d said Sandra Zampa, the under secretary at the Ministry of Health, who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had. \u201cWe closed gradually, as Europe is doing. France, Spain, Germany, the U.S. are doing the same. Every day you close a bit, you give up on a bit of normal life. Because the virus does not allow normal life.\u201d\nSome officials gave in to magical thinking, reluctant to make painful decisions sooner. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">All the while, the virus fed on that complacency.\n</span>Governments beyond Italy are now in danger of following the same path, repeating familiar mistakes and inviting similar calamity. And unlike Italy, which navigated uncharted territory for a Western democracy, other governments have less room for excuses.\nItalian officials, for their part, have defended their response, emphasizing that the crisis is unprecedented in modern times. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They assert that the government responded with speed and competence, immediately acting on the advice of its scientists and moving more swiftly on drastic, economically devastating measures than their European counterparts.\n</span>But tracing the record of their actions shows missed opportunities and critical missteps that have left the country in its worse state since World War II.\nIn the critical early days of the outbreak, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and other top officials sought to down play the threat, creating confusion and a false sense of security that allowed the virus to spread.\nThey blamed Italy\u2019s high number of infections on aggressive testing of people without symptoms in the north, which they argued only created hysteria and tarnished the country\u2019s image abroad.\nEven once the Italian government considered a universal lockdown necessary to defeat the virus, it failed to communicate the threat powerfully enough to persuade Italians to abide by the rules, which seemed riddled with loopholes.\n\u201cIt is not easy in a liberal democracy,\u201d said Walter Ricciardi, a World Health Organization board member and a top adviser to the health ministry, who argued that the Italian government acted on the scientific evidence made available to it.\nHe said the Italian government had moved at a much faster clip, and took the threat much more seriously, than its European neighbors or the United States.\nStill, he acknowledged that the health minister had struggled to persuade his government colleagues to move more quickly and that the difficulties of navigating Italy\u2019s division of powers between Rome and the regions resulted in a fragmented chain of command and inconsistent messages.\n\u201cIn times of war, like an epidemic,\u201d that system presented grave problems, he said, adding that it perhaps delayed the imposing of restrictive measures.\n\u201cI would have done <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 days</span></span> before, that is the only difference.\u201d\nIt Could Never Happen Here\nFor the coronavirus,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 days</span> can be a lifetime.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21,</span> as top Chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases \u201cwill be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,\u201d Italy\u2019s culture and tourism minister hosted a Chinese delegation for a concert at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to inaugurate the year of Italy-China Culture and Tourism.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Michele Geraci, Italy\u2019s former under secretary in the economic development ministry and a booster of closer relations with China, had a drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily.\n</span>\u201cAre we sure we want to do this?\u201d he said he asked them. \u201cShould we be here today?\u201d\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Italian officials say certainly not.\nMs. Zampa, the health ministry under secretary, said in retrospect she would have closed everything immediately. But in real time, it wasn\u2019t that clear.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Politicians across the spectrum worried about the economy and feeding the country, and found it difficult to accept their impotence in the face of the virus.\n</span>Most importantly, Italy looked at the example of China, Ms. Zampa said, not as a practical warning, but as a \u201cscience fiction movie that had nothing to do with us.\u201d And when the virus exploded, Europe, she said, \u201clooked at us the same way we looked at China.\u201d\nBut already in January, some officials on the right were urging Mr. Conte, their former ally and now political enemy, to quarantine schoolchildren in the northern regions who were returning from holidays in China, a measure aimed at protecting schools. Many of those children were from Chinese immigrant families.\nMany liberals criticized the proposal as populist fear-mongering. Mr. Conte declined the proposal and responded that the northern governors should trust the judgment of education and health authorities whom, he said, had proposed no such thing.\nBut Mr. Conte also demonstrated that he was taking the threat of contagion seriously. On Jan.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> he blocked all flights in and out of China.\n\u201cWe are the first country in Europe to adopt such a precautionary measure,\u201d he said.\nOver the next month, Italy responded swiftly to coronavirus scares. Two sick Chinese tourists and an Italian returning from China received care from a prominent infectious disease hospital in Rome. A false alarm led authorities to briefly confine passengers on a cruise ship docked outside of Rome.\n\u2018Patient One,\u2019 Super-spreader\nWhen a 38-year-old man went to the emergency room at a hospital in Codogno, a small town in the Lodi province of Lombardy, with severe flu symptoms on Feb.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18,</span> the case did not set off alarms.\nThe patient declined to be hospitalized and went home. He got sicker and returned to the hospital a few hours later and was admitted to a general medicine ward. On Feb.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20,</span> he went into intensive care, where he tested positive for the virus.\nThe man, who became known as Patient One, had had a busy month. He attended at least three dinners, played soccer and ran with a team, all apparently while contagious and without heavy symptoms.\nMr. Ricciardi said Italy had the bad luck of having a super spreader in a densely populated and dynamic area who went to the hospital not once, but twice, infecting hundreds of people, including doctors and nurses.\n\u201cHe was incredibly active,\u201d Mr. Ricciardi said.\nBut he also had not had any direct contacts with China, and experts suspect he contracted the virus from another European, meaning Italy did not have an identifiable patient zero or a traceable source of contagion that could help it contain the virus.\nThe virus had already been active in Italy for weeks by that time, experts now say, passed by people without symptoms and often mistaken for a flu. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">It spread around Lombardy, the Italian region that has by far the most trade with China and the home of Milan, the country\u2019s most culturally vibrant and business-centered city.\n</span>\u201cWho we call \u2018Patient One\u2019 was probably \u2018<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Patient 200,</span>\u2019 \u201d said Fabrizio Pregliasco, an epidemiologist.\nOn Sunday, Feb.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> the number of infections clicked <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passed 130 and</span> Italy sealed <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">off 11 towns</span> with police and military checkpoints. The last days of Venice Carnival were canceled. The Lombardy region closed its schools, museums and movie theaters. The Milanese made a run on the supermarkets.\nBut while Mr. Conte again commended Italy for its firm hand, he also sought to downplay the contagion, attributing the high numbers of infected to Lombardy\u2019s overzealous testing.\n\u201cWe have been the first country in the European Union to opt for more rigorous and strict controls in airports and cities,\u201d he said in an address to the nation. \u201cWe have more people infected because we made more swabs.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The next day, as infections <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surpassed 200,</span> seven people died and the stock market plunged, Mr. Conte and his health aides doubled down.\n</span>He blamed the Codogno hospital for the spread, saying it had handled things in \u201ca not-completely-proper way\u201d and argued that Lombardy and Veneto, another northern region, were inflating the severity of the problem by diverging from global guidelines and testing people without symptoms.\nAs Lombardy officials scrambled to free up hospital beds, and the number of infected people rose <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 309 with</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11 dead</span>, Mr. Conte said on Feb.<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 25 that</span> \u201cItaly is a safe country and probably safer than many others.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Conte\u2019s office offered an interview on the condition that he could answer questions in writing. When sent questions, including those about his past statements, he declined to respond.\nMixed Messages Sow Confusion\nReassurances from leaders confused the Italian population.\nOn Feb.<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> Mr. Zingaretti posted his aperitivo picture. That same day, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, the former leader of one of the governing parties, the Five Star Movement, held a news conference in Rome.\n\u201cIn Italy, we went from the risk of an epidemic to an infodemic,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said, disparaging media coverage that highlighted the threat of the contagion, and adding that only \u201c0.089 percent\u201d of the Italian population was quarantined.\nIn Milan, only miles from the center of the outbreak, the mayor, Beppe Sala, publicized a \u2018\u2018Milan Doesn\u2019t Stop\u2019\u2019 campaign, and the Duomo, the city\u2019s landmark cathedral that is a draw for tourists, reopened. People went out.\nBut on the sixth floor of the regional government headquarters in Milan, Giacomo Grasselli, who is the coordinator of the intensive care units throughout Lombardy, saw the numbers going up and quickly realized that it would be impossible to treat all the sick if the infections continued unabated.\nHis task force worked to match the sick to beds in intensive-care units in the nearest possible hospitals and appropriate dwindling resources.\nAt one of the daily meetings of <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 health</span> and political officials, he told the regional president, Attilio Fontana, about the growing numbers.\nAn epidemiologist showed the curves of infection. There was a catastrophe facing the region\u2019s well-respected health system.\n\u201cWe need to do something more,\u201d Mr. Grasselli told the room.\nMr. Fontana, who had been pressing the central government for tougher action, agreed. He said that the mixed messages from Rome and the easing of restrictions had led Italians to believe \u201cthat everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to.\u201d\nHe said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,\u201d said Mr. Fontana.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 billion</span> euro ($28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn\u2019t.\n</span>Ms. Zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of V\u00f2, the virus epicenter of the Veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the Codogno outbreak.\nShe said that the health minister, Mr. Speranza, and Mr. Conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In a <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surprise 2 a</span>.m. news conference on <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 8,</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">when 7,375 people</span> had already tested positive for coronavirus <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 366 had</span> died, Mr. Conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country\u2019s economic engine.\n</span>\u201cWe are facing an emergency,\u201d Mr. Conte said at the time. \u201cA national emergency.\u201d\nA draft of the decree, leaked to Italian media on Saturday night, pushed many Milan residents to rush to the train station in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.\nYet the following day, most Italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.\nTo clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued \u201cauto-certification\u201d forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or \u201cother\u201d necessities.\nIn the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self quarantine. Others didn\u2019t.\nThe broader restrictions in Lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on Codogno and other \u201cred zone\u201d towns linked to the original outbreak. Checkpoints disappeared. Local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.\nThree days later, on <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 11,</span> when the positive cases <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 12,462 and</span> the death toll climbed <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 827,</span> Mr. Conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.\nBut by then, some experts say, it was already too late.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Local Experiments\nItaly is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians.</span> The staggering number of recent deaths \u2014 more <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2,300 in</span> the last four days \u2014 are of people infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.\nRoberto Burioni, a prominent virologist at the San Raffaele University in Milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to \u201cthat behavior.\u201d\nThe government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. But on Saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.\nLeaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.\nOn Friday, Mr. Fontana complained that <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 114 troops</span> the government deployed were insignificant, and that at <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 1,000 should</span> be sent. He said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and \u201capply rigid measures.\u201d\n\u201cMy idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,\u201d he said.\nHis political ally, Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, pre-empted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that Rome needed to enforce \u201ca more drastic isolation,\u201d including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.\n\u201cWalks should be banned,\u201d he said.\nMr. Zaia has some credibility on the issue. As new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in V\u00f2, a town of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 3,000 people</span> that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country\u2019s first coronavirus death.\nSome government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. But Mr. Zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. The government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.\n\u201cAt least this slows down the virus\u2019 speed,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. \u2018\u2018And slowing down the virus\u2019 speed allows the hospitals to breathe.\u2019\u2019\nIf not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.\nAmericans and others, he said, \u201cneed to be ready.\u201d", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Not Relevant to the U.S. Economy": "6"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "4"}, "Economic Direction": {"Not relevant to the U.S. economy": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">As President Trump demanded a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the past year, Canada staked out a position squarely at odds with the White House:</span> Any new pact must recognize climate change.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">That demand is now facing a test.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The United States and Mexico, the other two parties to the three-nation trade deal, in recent days have hammered out a possible revision of the pact, and Mr. Trump is urging Canada to sign on or be hit with automobile tariffs.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The revised terms don\u2019t mention climate change, according to the scant details made public Monday, and the Trump administration has long dismissed the science that shows global warming poses a serious threat to people and economies.\n</span>Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, was in Washington on Tuesday to continue negotiations. Her government so far has given little indication of its intentions beyond a statement by Ms. Freeland\u2019s spokesman, Adam Austen, who said the priority was that any deal be \u201cgood for the middle class.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Canada\u2019s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement.\n</span>In France, the environment minister quit during a live radio interview on Tuesday, saying the nation wasn\u2019t doing enough on green issues. And last week in Australia, the prime minister was unseated by a challenger with strong coal-industry connections. Canada, much like Australia, has a powerful energy industry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a challenge from politicians aligned with the oil industry there. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, also has vowed to fight Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to put a price on carbon emission in Canada when it takes effect next year.\n</span>For reasons like these, Canadian environmental activists and United States foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government would have to pick and choose its priorities in the tense coming days, and many say climate change most likely will not make the cut. The Trump administration has opposed any mention of the phrase.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen at this point,\u201d said George David Banks, former international energy and environment adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Banks said neither the Trump administration nor Mexico appeared interested in pursuing climate change in Nafta.\nMr. Trump has said if a compromise cannot be negotiated with Canada he will cut the country out of the deal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s not at all clear, though, that Congress \u2014 which must sign off on any trade deal before it takes effect \u2014 would accept that.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">For Canada the risks are both economic and political.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, American exports to Canada have <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 165 percent</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1993,</span> the year before Nafta came into force, and imports from Canada <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 150 percent</span>.</span> If Mr. Trudeau is unable to strike a deal with Mr. Trump he could come off looking weak in the eyes of his public. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But if Mr. Trump imposes <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 25 percent</span> tariff on automobiles it would hit hard the economic powerhouse province of Ontario.\n</span>The absence of climate change language wouldn\u2019t have an immediate effect on the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions projections from Canada, the United States or Mexico. After all, the current agreement also makes no mention of the need to drive down global warming.\nBut environmentalists say that failing to incorporate a mention would be a missed opportunity to make a statement in support of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 Paris</span> Agreement, which calls on <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 200 nations</span> to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and which did not exist when Nafta was drafted.\n\u201cIt violates the norm that the environment belongs at the negotiating table,\u201d said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe seem to be pushing our trading partners to say, \u2018It\u2019s prosperity or the environment.</span> It\u2019s prosperity or human rights,\u2019\u201d he said, arguing that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as an either-or.\nCanada, for its part, has made climate change a centerpiece of its international agenda. It features prominently in the title, for example, of upcoming discussions at the Group <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 energy</span> discussions slated for Nova Scotia in September.\nBut the Canadian government also has sought out ways to avoid isolating the Trump administration by bringing less antagonizing issues, for instance cleaning plastic from the oceans, to the table.\nWhen it comes to Nafta, the Trudeau government has taken a similarly pliable position. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In August, Ms. Freeland outlined Canada\u2019s vision for what it called \u201cprogressive elements\u201d to any new trilateral trade deal.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The priorities: strengthening labor safeguards and incorporating new chapters on gender equality, indigenous rights and climate change.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">On climate, Mr. Trudeau maintained that he wanted to see the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to move to a low-carbon economy to be written into the new Nafta.\n</span>\u201cWe are certainly looking for a better level playing field across North America on environmental protections,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said last year.\nShortly after that remark, the Canadian foreign affairs minister sent the Trump administration a proposed chapter that included those elements but did not require the United States to accept or embrace the Paris Agreement.\nHowever, late last year the Trump administration declined to accept that language, according to Mr. Banks and a Canadian official who asked not to be identified.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request to discuss the role of that agenda in this week\u2019s talks.\n</span>\u201cThe big question will be to what extent Canada will be interested in going to the wall on climate,\u201d said Dale Marshall, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, a Canadian nonprofit group. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen the rubber hits the road and we\u2019re talking about economic trade, does Canada feel strong enough about those issues to be willing to scuttle a deal?</span> I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Joshua C. Zive, a trade lobbyist who works with energy and utility companies for the firm Bracewell in Washington, said he did not think pushing climate change this week would be in Canada\u2019s negotiating interest.</span> Already, he said, the Trump administration is intent on casting Mr. Trudeau as the scapegoat if a deal falls through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,\u201d Mr. Zive said. \u201cIf it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Mr. Zive for his part questioned the need to incorporate climate change into Nafta, and said the trade deal had always been a fairly technical way to deal with specific products like automobiles.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">If negotiators push for a mention of climate change \u201cjust for symbolic purposes, you\u2019re also importing the symbolic controversy,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere is no need to force people to resolve this in an already-complicated and high-stakes trade dispute.\u201d\nMr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration.\n</span>\u201cAs the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States\u2019 competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,\u201d he said.\nCatherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto.\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

{"id": "62318", "displayed_text": "<h3>To Trump Supporters, Here Are 9 Things This Conservative Assumes About You</h3>Dear Trump Supporter,\n\nLet me start by saying that I get it. I get the frustration.\n\nI, too, am tired of all the PC language that has dominated our culture. I'm tired of having to be careful about everything (and I mean everything) I say for fear of accidentally offending someone and dealing with hyped up repercussions.\n\nI, too, am sickened with politics as usual -- with a stagnant, do-nothing government. I'm tired of unmet promises and of wimpy politicians who won't stand up for what is right and what needs to be done.\n\nI, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again.\n\nSo I get it.\n\nI get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Why wouldn't we want an accomplished businessman to run the \"business\" of the states?</span> Why wouldn't we want a person who could not care less what people think to break through the barriers of our hypersensitive speech? Why wouldn't we root for someone radically different than what we've seen before in Washington, who promises to get stuff done, while at the same time makes us laugh?\n\nBut this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.\n\nFor the Donald has said and done a number of things that many analysts have stated should have knocked him out of the race. But rather than causing him to lose ground with you, you have stood faithful. In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.\n\nTherefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.\n\nSo while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.\n\nOn <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18,</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" McCain had <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.\n\nTrump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 298 charities</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2009 and</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.\n\nIn other words, \"leading\" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:\n\nWounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.\n\nAfter this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $57,000 to</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.\n\nSo I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly \"imitated\" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.\n\nThough Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.\n\nNot convinced? You decide:\n\nFor any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?\n\nAP Photo/Andrew <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Harnik\n\n3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.\n\nTrump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> \"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**.\" Granted, that was <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.\n\nAnd while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had \"the Face of a Dog,\" calling a lawyer \"disgusting\" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.\n\n\"I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.\"\n\nThis is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, \"If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\"\n\nAny self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?\n\nIt is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).\n\nLast year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.\n\nMany, as a result, have accused him of being a \"racist.\" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.\n\nPerhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.\n\n</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.\n\nBut if that label of \"racism\" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:\n\na person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is \"bigot.\"\n\nAs Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, \"It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.\"\n\nAs a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.\n\nIn the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.\n\nHe previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as \"incompetent.\"</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is \"the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.\"\n\nHe once said he was \"very pro-choice\" and now he says he is \"very pro-life.\" <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Up <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\n</span>\"In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nJust on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.\n\n</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.\n\nMany Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.\n\nTrump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.\n\nIn your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.\n\nThere was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.\n\nYes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians;\" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an \"active member\" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a \"Christian\") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.\n\nAdd in his questionable moral behaviors, his \"love of money,\" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.\n\nFor many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?\n\nIn addition,<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a \"huckster\" and a \"menace to American conservatism.\"\n\nAnd as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).\n\nWe promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.\n\nIt's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.\n\nHIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.\n\nAs writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:\n\nBullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors\" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.\n\nMany mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.\n\nAs clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, \"To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.\"\n\nNarcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, \"Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\"\n\nMichaelis adds, \"He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.\"\n\nSo why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?\n\nOf course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n\n8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...\n\n...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).\n\nTrump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama \"led the way.\"\n\nHe has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.\n\nPhoto by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nBut what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?\n\nAnd in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.\n\nFurthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:\n\n\"We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.\"\n\nIn regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, \"Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.\"\n\nNow if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?\n\n\"First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\"\n\nIn terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.\n\nRecently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.\n\nFirst, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?\n\nSecond, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?\n\nThird, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?\n\nFourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?\n\nWill he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?\n\nTrump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:\n\n9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).\n\nEarly on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton \"plant\" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.\n\nTrump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.\n\nAs to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.\n\nIf the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).\n\nMy vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.\n\nOr...\n\n9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to \"make America great again,\" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your \"momma\" or \"daddy\" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.\n\nSo far Trump's demonstration of \"great\" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.\n\nMany conservatives themselves, including \"Tea Party\" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.\n\nAnd yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.\n\nRemember, the Donald is playing \"nice\" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8 </span>(that's pronounced \"first Samuel eight\"), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.\n\n</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:\n\nNot since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.\n\nBut it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?\n\nNow if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.\n\n\"It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?\"\n\nBut when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.\n\nBut if not then, well, I've already listed it.\n\nThe question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?\n\nAmerica is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.\n\nAmerica is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.\n\nAmerica is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.\n\nAmerica is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.\n\nIn some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.\n\nBut in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?\n\nIf Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.\n\nIf that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.\n\nSo the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?\n\nI guess we'll start to get a picture soon, beginning <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Feb 1.</span>\n\nA version of this post originally appeared on HonestlyThinking.org.", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}

Kennedy Jr.\nIt found that Kennedy and his group, which news rating service NewsGuard reports \u201chas published false and unproven scientific and health information,\u201d have more than doubled their Twitter followings since <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2021.</span> And researchers said the Daily Wire has been the most popular news publisher on Facebook since <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2021,</span> with much of its engagement \u201ccentered around content critical of vaccines and vaccine policy.\u201d\nResearchers say the findings highlight that sites known to spread misleading or false medical information at times dramatically outperform reliable sources on social media, and that anti-vaccine content can be a driver for that engagement.\n\u201cNot only are these sites gaining audience share while trafficking in false or misleading claims, these claims seem to be driving some of their engagement,\u201d said Karen Kornbluh, director of GMF\u2019s Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative and an Obama administration alum.\nAccording to the study, the Daily Wire was the top-performing site in terms of engagement every week during the second half <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span></span> and it drew more interactions \u2014 likes, comments and shares \u2014 than the New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times and NPR combined. And the site garnered \u201cthe most [interactions] of any outlet on vaccine mandate articles, and nearly triple the next highest site,\u201d according to the report.\nThe study also found that the Daily Wire\u2019s posts about vaccine mandates in particular drew significantly more engagement than their typical ones, \u201cindicating that the site found success in pushing content that tapped into ongoing culture wars around U.S. COVID policies.\u201d\nNewsGuard has found that the site has \u201cpublished unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims about COVID-19.\u201d\nOn Twitter, the Children\u2019s Health Defense has \u201cregularly outperformed more reliable news outlets that met NewsGuard\u2019s criteria for trustworthiness, despite repeatedly publishing false information about COVID-19,\u201d according to the report. That included posts misleadingly claiming that Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates \u201cadmitted \u2026 that the [COVID] vaccines aren\u2019t effective.\u201d\nThe findings also raise questions about the efficacy of how platforms have responded to misleading health claims, including by adding information labels to posts and surfacing authoritative sources of medical information.\nResearchers found that the Children\u2019s Health Defense \u201cfrequently evades fact-check labels\u201d on Twitter. \u201cAnti-vaccine promoters managed to evade platform policies, distorting the information system with out-sized footprints during the second half <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span></span>\u201d researchers wrote.\n\u201cIt will take stepped-up efforts from the platforms to tackle this problem going forward,\u201d Kornbluh said.\nAaron Simpson, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a statement, \u201cVoicing opposition to government mandates is not against our policies \u2026 What we do have clear rules against is harmful COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation.\u201d Twitter teams frequently apply warnings to links posted to the site, and exclude some Tweets with particular links from amplification and recommendations, according to Twitter spokesperson Elizabeth Busby.\nRepresentatives from the Children\u2019s Health Defense and the Daily Wire did not return requests for comment.\nA separate GMF report last year found that sites that share news misleadingly, rather than blatantly lying, drew record shares of engagement on Facebook.\nTogether, the findings show how influential and wide-reading this kind of murky content that often stops just short of falsehood can be online.\nOur top tabs\nTwitter mistakenly deleted accounts exposing Russian disinformation\nResearchers have posted evidence on Twitter in recent weeks showing that Russian-made videos claiming to show violence in Ukraine\u2019s separatist regions were faked. But their accounts were deleted, sparking speculation that a Russian-led effort had gotten them banned from the platform, Craig Timberg reports. But Twitter was actually responsible for the problem, with its reviewers mistakenly banning them after concluding that videos posted by researchers were manipulated images, Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said.\nRosborough cited Twitter\u2019s policy against \u201csynthetic and manipulated media.\u201d She also said she knew of less than a dozen accounts that had been affected.\nBellingcat researcher Nick Waters said he <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">counted 15 erroneously</span> blocked accounts. \u201cHe welcomed the acknowledgment of error by Twitter but said such problems have happened repeatedly around the world, including in Syria, Turkey and India,\u201d Craig writes.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Police arrested an Amazon union organizer in Staten Island\nAmazon Labor Union President Chris Smalls was charged with trespassing, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, Bloomberg News\u2019s Josh Eidelson, Michael Tobin, and Fola Akinnibi report.</span> Two workers who support the union were also arrested, though it\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019ve been charged or released.\nIt came as the Staten Island Amazon warehouse prepares for a unionization vote in around a month.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Smalls drove into the warehouse\u2019s parking lot to deliver food and union literature for employees to share, union vice president Connor Spence, who said he witnessed the incident, told Bloomberg News.</span> Amazon says it fired Smalls <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 for</span> breaking its safety rules; Smalls said he was raising concerns about its coronavirus policies.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Amazon didn\u2019t say whether it called the police, telling Bloomberg News that it \u201cdid not call the police on employees.\u201d</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel told the outlet that \u201cSmalls \u2014 who is not employed by Amazon \u2014 has repeatedly trespassed despite multiple warnings.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Today, when police officers asked Mr. Smalls to leave, he instead chose to escalate the situation and the police made their own decision on how to respond.\u201d\nAmazon Labor Union attorney Seth Goldstein said that calling the police constituted a violation of a National Labor Relations Board settlement.</span> The outlet couldn\u2019t reach Smalls for comment.\nRant and rave\nFacebook parent Meta unveiled its plans for artificial intelligence and the metaverse at an event Wednesday, Reuters's Elizabeth Culliford reports.

{"id": "63507", "displayed_text": "<h3>As China Talks Begin, Trump\u2019s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering</h3>WASHINGTON \u2014 <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">In the middle of his crowded dinner in Buenos Aires with President Xi Jinping of China, President Trump leaned across the table, pointed to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative whose skepticism of China runs deep, and declared, \u201cThat\u2019s my negotiator!\u201d\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">He then turned to Peter Navarro, his even more hawkish trade adviser, adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s my tough guy!\u201d</span> according to aides with knowledge of the exchange.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Now, with talks between China and the United States set to begin this week in Beijing, Mr. Lighthizer, aided by Mr. Navarro, faces the assignment of a lifetime: redefining the trade relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies by Mr. Trump\u2019s <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2 deadline</span> to reach an agreement.\n</span>And he must do it in a way that tilts the balance of power toward the United States. His approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">First, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Despite his declaration that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d and his recent boast that he is a \u201cTariff Man,\u201d Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.\n</span>Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his advisers that Mr. Xi is someone with whom he can cut a big deal, according to people who have spoken with the president. On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi to discuss the status of talks, tweeting afterward that good progress was being made. \u201cDeal is moving along very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nThe administration has tried to force China to change its ways with stiff tariffs <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">on $250 billion</span> worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and threats of additional levies on <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $267 billion</span> worth of goods. China has responded with its own tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods. But over a steak dinner during the Group <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 summit</span> meeting in Argentina, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump agreed to a 90-day truce and to work toward an agreement that Mr. Trump said could lead to \u201cone of the largest deals ever made.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s not some subtle shift; Trump has flipped since September,\u201d said Derek Scissors, who studies China\u2019s economy for the American Enterprise Institute.</span> \u201cHe went from saying how he was going to slap tariffs on everything to all this talk about making the greatest deal ever.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer \u2014 whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February \u2014 has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting \u201cempty promises\u201d like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Lighthizer,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 71,</span> is pushing for substantive changes, such as forcing China to end its practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.</span> But <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 40 years</span> of dealing with China and watching it dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs in order to win true concessions.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Lighthizer senses that anyone \u2014 even Mr. Trump \u2014 might be going a little soft on China, he opens a paper-clipped manila folder he totes around and brandishes a single-page, easy-reading chart that lists decades of failed trade negotiations with Beijing, according to administration officials.\n</span>\u201cBob\u2019s attitude toward China is very simple. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">He wants them to surrender,\u201d said William A. Reinsch, a former federal trade official who met him three decades ago when Mr. Lighthizer was a young aide for former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.</span> \u201cHis negotiating strategy is simple too. He basically gives them a list of things he wants them to do and says, \u2018Fix it now.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Lighthizer last month to lead the talks initially spooked markets, which viewed the China skeptic\u2019s appointment as an ominous sign. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">It also annoyed Chinese officials, who had been talking with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a more moderate voice on trade and the primary point of contact for Liu He, China\u2019s top trade negotiator.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Mnuchin has urged the president to avoid a protracted trade war, even if that entails reaching an interim agreement that leaves some issues unresolved.\n</span>Mr. Mnuchin, who attended the G-20 dinner, helped Mr. Trump craft an upbeat assessment declaring the Buenos Aires meeting \u201chighly successful\u201d in the presidential limousine back to the airport, according to a senior administration official.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The disparate views among Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers have prompted sparring \u2014 both publicly and behind the scenes.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2017,</span> when Mr. Lighthizer grew concerned that Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, were wading too far into China matters, he enlisted Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary at the time, to persuade Mr. Trump to draft a document designating Mr. Lighthizer the main trade emissary to China, according to a person who has seen the letter.</span> Mr. Lighthizer has never used the document to defend his position, the person said, but he considers it an insurance policy of sorts.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">During an Oval Office meeting with the trade team the fall <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> Mr. Lighthizer accused Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the former National Economic Council director, of bad-mouthing him to free-trade Republican senators.\n</span>The argument grew so heated that the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, quickly pulled the combatants into the nearby Roosevelt Room and away from the president, where the argument raged on for a few more minutes, according to two witnesses.\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, disputed the account.\n</span>Mr. Lighthizer has since worked to increase his own face time with Mr. Trump. He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president\u2019s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">own $2.3 million</span> waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.\nHe used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China\u2019s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing\u2019s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Mr. Scissors said.\nThose who know Mr. Lighthizer say he will try to force concessions through a combination of pressure tactics, like tariffs, and public condemnation. Mr. Lighthizer \u2014 who described his own negotiating style as \u201cknowing where the leverage is\u201d during <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1984 interview</span> \u2014 typically presents few specific demands during initial talks while publicly bashing efforts by the other side.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He used that approach during recent talks with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, criticizing foreign counterparts as intransigent and characterizing complaints by American businesses as pure greed.\n</span>Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s unsparing view of China comes, in part, from his childhood in Ashtabula, Ohio, an industrial and shipping town on the Great Lakes hit by the offshoring of steel and chemical production. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">For much of his career, Mr. Lighthizer was a lonely protectionist voice in a Republican Party dominated by free traders, alternating between jobs in government and a lucrative private law career representing large American corporations like United States Steel in trade cases against China.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Mr. Lighthizer found his way into Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit through his work in the steel industry, where he gained prominence by filing lawsuits accusing Japan and China of dumping metals into the United States, in violation of trade laws.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2011,</span> Mr. Lighthizer caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with an opinion piece in The Washington Times, in which he defended Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to China as consistent with conservative ideology and compared the future president to Republican icons like Ronald Reagan.\nTaciturn in public and self-deprecating in private, Mr. Lighthizer sees himself as a serious player on the world stage: Two recent guests to Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s Georgetown townhouse were greeted by the stern visage of their host staring down at them from an oil portrait on the wall.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The trade adviser is guarded around Mr. Trump, often waiting until the end of meetings to make his points and quietly nudging the president away from actions he views as counterproductive, current and former officials said.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">That was the case in mid-2017 when he cautioned the president against withdrawing unilaterally from the World Trade Organization, adding for emphasis, \u201cAnd I hate the W.T.O. as much as anybody.\u201d\n</span>He does not always get his way. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In the wake of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this fall, Mr. Lighthizer urged Mr. Trump to consider easing steel and aluminum tariffs on those countries and replacing them with less burdensome quotas.</span> Mr. Trump rejected his plan, according to negotiators from all three countries.\nA poker-faced Mr. Lighthizer broke the news to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts by declaring the proposal was inoperative, one of the officials said.\nThe president also ignored Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s advice in early December when he announced that he intended to begin the six-month process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta in order to pressure House Democrats into passing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">That threat undermined months of quiet negotiations between Mr. Lighthizer, labor groups and Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to try to win their support for the new trade deal.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump has yet to follow through on his threat, and Mr. Lighthizer continues trying to work with Democrats to get the new trade deal approved.\n</span>\u201cBob is trying to provide stability and focus in a completely chaotic environment,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Bob, but I am certain he is frustrated. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">How could you not be frustrated as the U.S. trade representative for a president who knows what his gut thinks but hasn\u2019t put much of his brains into trade?\u201d</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Government revenue and expenses [articles focused on lawmaking and government action including treaties, regulation, taxes, laws, and spending]": "3"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}

{"id": "64400", "displayed_text": "<h3>Opinion | Why the age of inequality has made us less happy</h3>As it turns out, people who trumpet that research ignore a major finding in it: People do express more satisfaction with their overall lives the more money they have on hand. They also ignore a more recent survey of millionaires, which found those <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with $8 million</span> banked were happier than those with less than that amount.\nA fascinating study released last month offers us another angle to consider in the money and happiness conundrum: It\u2019s quite possible that the age of inequality has come for our happiness.\nIn a paper released last month by the journal Emotion, researchers Jean Twenge and A. Bell Cooper studied responses to questions about happiness from the General Social Survey. Looking at decades of people\u2019s answers to questions such as whether someone was \u201cvery happy,\u201d they found that \u201cmoney and prestige do appear to buy happiness, and more is continuously better.\u201d But there is a kicker: This was not a stable finding.\nIn the 1970s, people with different amounts of money experienced similar levels of happiness. But over time a gap developed, one that turned into something of a chasm. When Twenge spoke to The Post earlier this month, she speculated that inequality is a major reason.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Income inequality was not much of an issue in the early to mid-1970s, when the <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 1 percent</span> of households earned less <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> of total income in the United States.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But the income gap between <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1 percent</span> and the rest is now at the highest level <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 50 years</span>, driven by everything from the decline of union representation among workers \u2014 unions not only bargain for better pay, but also for workplace protections \u2014 to the offshoring of jobs to increasing CEO pay.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The necessities of life didn\u2019t come down in price to make up for the difference.</span> Instead, they went up. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Adjusted for inflation, the cost of attending college \u2014 either public or private \u2014 more than doubled.</span> The same is true for buying a home. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The price of health care soared so high that the typical employer-provided family plan now costs more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $20,000,</span> and comes with a four-figure deductible.</span> (The typical family only pays <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $6,000 of</span> it, but you can think of that <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">other $14,000 as</span> something you might otherwise see in your paycheck, if you are lucky enough to still have one.) <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">And as two-earner families became the norm, there was a new, backbreaking expense that needed to be accounted for: child care, something that has risen in price such that in a majority of states, it costs more than attending public college.\n</span>What we call a \u201cgood life\u201d got harder and harder for many to afford, leaving many to borrow more and more money \u2014 mortgages, student loans, credit cards, you name it. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">But it should surprise no one to discover that struggling with debt is correlated with greater levels of depression.</span> One study, published in Social Science & Medicine <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> found those with student loans are more likely to experience \u201cpoorer psychological functioning.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just that, as research shows, using money to buy our way out of tasks we find unpleasant \u2014 like housekeeping or cooking \u2014 increases our happiness level. It\u2019s also that money buys privilege \u2014 the privilege of health (yes, the wealthy are healthier, and, yes, good health increases happiness), or, say, the privilege of working from home during a pandemic.\nIn the United States, we buy books on happiness, and we download apps that claim they will improve our mood. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Yet all too many of us live in denial of the impacts of income and wealth inequality.</span> When asked, we routinely overestimate the middle and lower classes\u2019 share of the money pie, and we are more likely than those in countries with less inequality to tell pollsters that working hard is key to getting ahead in life.\nIn a society that is all but obsessed with the idea of happiness, I suspect it\u2019s simply too painful to admit that our chances of achieving it are greater when our literal fortunes are greater, too.\nRead more:", "label_annotations": {"frame": {"Macroeconomic / General Economic Conditions [in the U.S.]": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"No Opinion": "2"}, "Economic Direction": {"No opinion": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 22s "}}
