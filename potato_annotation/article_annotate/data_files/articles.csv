American employers extended an impressive run of hiring in May, even as policymakers took steps to cool the economy in an effort to ease high inflation.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Friday that employers <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span></span>, the 17th straight monthly gain.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3.6 percent</span> for the third straight month, a touch away from a half-century low.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">At the same time, the labor force grew <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 330,000 people</span>, and the share of adults employed or looking for work continued to edge closer to prepandemic levels.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The data signaled that the Federal Reserve’s initial moves to dial back its monetary support for the economy were — at least so far — not constraining business activity so much that hiring was feeling a pinch.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After the strong rebound from the depths of the coronavirus lockdowns — all <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">but 800,000 of</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 22 million</span> jobs that were lost have been recovered — the Fed has shifted its emphasis from maximum employment to its other mandate: price stability.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The challenge is to apply its primary tool, a steady series of interest-rate increases, without inflicting a recession.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“I think we’re on sort of what looks like a glide path right now, and that’s good — nothing’s broken,” said Guy Berger, the principal economist at the career-focused social network LinkedIn.</span> “But keep fast-forwarding it a year and the question marks are still big.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The closely watched indicators include the impact on wages, which have been increasing at a pace not seen in decades, though not enough to keep up with inflation over the past year.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed is worried that rising labor costs will be passed along to consumers.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Wages kept rising across industries.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Percent change in average hourly earnings for nonmanagers since January 2019
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">On that score, the Labor Department report showed little change in trajectory.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Average hourly earnings <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.3 percent</span> from the previous month, the same pace as in April, and <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 5.2 percent</span> higher than a year earlier, compared with <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5.5 percent</span> year-over-year increase in April.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“It’s moderating, but it’s not moderating to a level, I think, where it’s consistent with the Fed’s inflation goals,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said of wage growth.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">He said the Fed would probably want wages to cool toward an <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">annualized 3.5 percent</span> pace, at the higher end, a rate that officials view as aligned <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2 percent</span> inflation.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">The State of Jobs in the United States
Job gains continue to maintain their impressive run, even as government policymakers took steps to cool the economy and ease inflation.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">- May Jobs Report: U.S. employers <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span></span> and the unemployment rate remained steady <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.6 percent</span> in the fifth month <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022.</span>
- Vacancies: Employers <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 11.4 million</span> vacancies in April down from a revised total of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 11.9 million</span> the previous month, which was a record.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">- Opportunities for Teenagers: Jobs for high school and college students are expected to be plentiful this summer, and a large market means better pay.
- Higher Interest Rates: Spurred by red-hot inflation, the Federal Reserve has begun raising interest rates.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">What does that mean for the job market?
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">President Biden gave a nuanced celebration of the jobs data in remarks on Friday, emphasizing recent gains while arguing that a slowdown would be welcome, allowing inflation to ease.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">“The point is this: We’ve laid an economic foundation that’s historically strong,” Mr. Biden said.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Now we’re moving forward to a new moment, where we can build on that foundation, build a future of stable, steady growth so that we can bring down inflation without sacrificing all of the historic gains that we have made.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Stocks declined on Friday and bond yields rose as investors evidently read the report as reinforcing the Fed’s muscular efforts, which risk denting economic growth.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">“The better the data, the more difficult that a pause or reduced pace of tightening later this year becomes,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a research report published after the jobs numbers were released.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The continued job gains are among many indications of a vibrant economy.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Reports from the nation’s largest banks show checking accounts are still <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2019 levels</span> for nearly all income groups.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">New bankruptcies and debt-collection proceedings are both at their lowest levels since tracking began <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span>
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Yet those encouraging trends have been at odds with the generally sour national mood, dominated by inflation concerns.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">U.S. consumer sentiment declined in early May to the lowest <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to the University of Michigan.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate stayed flat in May.

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">And with a potential change in the economic cycle, economic security is not evenly distributed among households.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">If tightening financial conditions prompt businesses to downsize, research shows that “last hired” workers will typically be the “first fired” — and that Black and Hispanic workers and those with less education are particularly vulnerable.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">But a broad range of economists and policymakers, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, stress that more modest wage gains when paired with milder prices will be more sustainable for all workers, who are also consumers, in the long run.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“The Fed at this point is saying, look, we’d rather head off inflationary pressures, because if we have to slam on the brakes, then we’re going to cause a recession and it will be worse for these underserved communities,” said Gerald Cohen, an economist at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">“It’s a challenge, because they want to pull people into the labor force.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">They know the way to do that is through higher wages.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But higher wages can also breed higher inflation.”
</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">For employers, too, the prospective change in the economic picture may not be spread evenly.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">“Businesses with high profitability, easy access to capital, the capacity to automate and pricing power are still eager to hire,” said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, a large commercial bank based in Texas.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">“But businesses that are seeing their margins squeezed by rising costs, like hospitality, or that are seeing demand soften, like retail, are pulling job postings as their outlook softens.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">And competition for workers is squeezing lower-paying employers out of the job market.”
</span>Richard Canny, the president of Ultimation in Roseville, Mich., is feeling that squeeze. <span id=""43"" class=""red"">His company’s conveyor belts and simple robots for use in warehousing and distribution sold briskly during the tight labor market, as e-commerce companies sought to make each worker more productive.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">With 45 employees</span>, Mr. Canny said, Ultimation has managed to stay at full staffing by raising wages — <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $17 to</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $18 an</span> hour to start, from <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $13 to</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $15 </span>— as well as offering perks like parental leave and partial tuition reimbursement.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">His white-collar employees have retained the flexibility to work from home.</span> <span id=""46"" class=""red"">All that, he said, is necessary to compete with big employers in the area like Amazon.
</span>“Small companies historically haven’t had to offer the same kind of benefits as the large ones, but I think that’s changed since Covid,” Mr. Canny said.
<span id=""47"" class=""red"">Prime-age workers came back to the labor force in May
Share of those <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 25 to</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 54 who</span> are in the labor force (employed, unemployed but looking for work or on temporary layoff)
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">At this point in the recovery, labor- and business-oriented economists alike believe that expanding the supply of labor may be even more important than jobs gains themselves.
</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">There are nearly two openings for every job seeker, and several factors are unlikely to change in the near term.</span> Some, like the large cohort of retiring baby boomers, are simply demographic.
More opportunities for women could be part of the answer. <span id=""50"" class=""red"">Employment of women was <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 181,000 in</span> May, yet more <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 700,000 below</span> the level in <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2020.</span>
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">That lag may stem, in part, from the lapse of last year’s child tax credit expansion, argued Elizabeth Ananat, a professor of women and economics at Barnard College, who has researched the program’s effects on parental employment and labor force participation.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">The credit gave most families monthly payments of up <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $250 per</span> older child <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $300 per</span> young child, “helping families weather both inflation and the not-fully-recovered job market, leading to our biggest-ever cuts in poverty for families,” Ms. Ananat said.</span> For families with a child <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 5,</span> she said, a quarter of the credit was being spent on child care.
Summer Seay,<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34,</span> of Chattanooga, Tenn., worked as a senior customer service representative at Cigna, the health insurer, throughout the pandemic, <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">making $23 an</span> hour. <span id=""53"" class=""red"">But she left in late April to spend more time caring for her three children while assisting her husband with “more of the paperwork” for the family’s wooden pallet business.
</span><span id=""54"" class=""red"">One reason she decided to leave the wage-earning work force was frustration that much of her pay was merely covering child care costs, which had mounted <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $700 a</span> week just as the expanded child tax credit expired.
</span>“It kind of went hand in hand,” she said. “Because our big thing is food, feeding the kids.”
Another missing element of the work force are recent immigrants. Goldman Sachs researchers said recently that because of visa restrictions and health protocols <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">during 2020 and</span><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> the total number of workers was <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1.6 million</span> below where it would be otherwise. Legal immigration rates and refugee admissions have returned to prepandemic levels under the Biden administration, the analysts found, but are not enough to make up the difference.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Weakness in the GDP report also was evident in government outlays and consumer spending, which slowed to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.1 percent</span> gain <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 4 percent</span> in the final quarter <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017.</span></span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Slumping auto sales were a major contributor.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Commerce Department analysts reported worrying signs of rising prices with a key price index, excluding volatile food and energy costs, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 2.5 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">That was the fastest pace <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011 and</span> it comes as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is trying to prevent the economy from growing so fast that it sparks a spiral of rising prices.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Fed, which wants to keep price increases to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2 percent</span> annually, raised short-term interest rates in March for the sixth time <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2015 when</span> they were near zero.

135,"<h3>Republicans knock holes in Affordable Care Act but don’t demolish the law</h3>Before Congress left Washington for the year, Republicans finally made good on their determination to knock big holes in the Affordable Care Act, crippling its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance and leaving insurers without billions of dollars in promised federal payments.
At the same time, public support for the perennially controversial law has inched up to around its highest point in a half-dozen years. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 9 million</span> people so far have signed up for ACA health plans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2018 during</span> a foreshortened enrollment season, far surpassing expectations.
This dual reality puts the sprawling ACA — prized domestic legacy of the Obama era, whipping post of the Trump administration — at a new precipice, with its long-term fate hinging on the November midterm elections certain to consume Washington once the new year begins. If Democrats win a majority in either chamber of Congress, the law would be protected; a GOP sweep could further embolden repeal attempts.
“It’s right on the balance there,” said Robert J. Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis. “The viability of the program is heavily dependent on the outcome of the election, not the changes in between.”
With recent polls showing health care remains a top concern among voters, both major political parties have an incentive to wield it as an election issue. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Democrats are likely to argue that the GOP wants to take coverage away from millions of Americans, with Republicans focusing on escalating insurance prices.
</span>What happens in the interim, health policy analysts say, depends on how events play out in three arenas — Capitol Hill, the White House and the insurance industry.
After a year of full GOP control, congressional Republicans and the White House have damaged the ACA but fallen short of their vehement goal of dismantling broad swaths of it. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">More ambiguous is whether their end-of-year victory — removing tax penalties starting <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 for</span> people who violate the insurance mandate — will whet the GOP’s appetite for taking apart more of the law.
</span>“To those who believe — including Senate Republican leadership — that <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 </span>there</span> will not be another effort to repeal and replace Obamacare — well you are sadly mistaken,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted last week.
Graham’s vow was a rejoinder to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested in an NPR interview that “we’ll probably move on to other issues.” He also noted that the chamber’s slender GOP majority will shrink to one senator once the Democratic winner of a special election in Alabama is sworn in next month.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">McConnell reiterated his intention to try to coax the Senate early in the year to adopt two measures, promised to a crucial Senate Republican moderate in exchange for her support of the massive tax overhaul enacted last week, that would help cushion ACA insurance marketplaces.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">One bill would restore for two years the payments that the law guarantees insurers — estimated <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $8 billion</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 </span>— to reimburse them for discounts that ACA health plans must give lower-income customers for deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.</span> President Trump cut off the payments in October.
The other bill would provide <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $10 billion</span> over two years to help states create high-risk pools or otherwise help insurers cope with customers with especially high medical costs. House conservatives fiercely opposed both measures.
Meanwhile, the administration is pressing forward with at least one more jab at the ACA marketplaces. As directed by an executive order that President Trump signed this fall, officials are finishing a draft rule to make it easier for insurers to sell meager but inexpensive health plans that skirt the law’s coverage requirements.
The ground-level effect of such changes for consumers rests in large part on how the insurance industry responds. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Without the measure to help stabilize the law’s marketplaces and with greater availability of skimpy health plans, “we risk the individual market on the exchanges becoming a de facto high-risk pool,” said one industry official not authorized to speak on the record.</span> That means premiums would soar, causing those exchanges to shrink and become the province of sick, expensive customers.
On the other hand, said Joseph Antos, a health-care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, more expensive premiums could “move in the opposite direction of knocking down the ACA” because the law’s premium subsidies would rise to keep pace. For the more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 percent</span> of ACA customers who qualify for those subsidies, he said, more generous subsidies could make it easier to afford higher tiers of coverage, motivating more people to sign up.
Such hard-to-predict boomerang effects could be true of the insurance mandate as well. The requirement has always been the least popular part of the law. So at a time when the most recent polls show that slightly more than half the public regards the ACA favorably, removing the most objectionable feature “could even be a blessing in disguise” for supporters, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Trump sought last week to equate the part of the tax legislation that undermines the individual mandate with repeal of the entire law.</span> His assertion at a Cabinet meeting was a pronounced overstatement. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Other central features of the ACA remain intact — including its insurance marketplaces, intended for Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job; the expansion of Medicaid in more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 states</span> plus the District of Columbia; and the premium subsidies.
</span>In fact, health-policy analysts say ending the penalties for violating the mandate will be a real-world test of a debate that has simmered for years: whether a legal requirement to be insured motivates people to get coverage, or whether the ACA’s subsidies are a stronger incentive.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">According to the most recent federal figures,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6.7 million</span> Americans who flouted the requirement paid a total of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 billion</span> in tax penalties <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Ending the penalties will cause an <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional 4 million</span> people to be uninsured <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 million</span> within a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</span> Insurance premiums in the ACA marketplaces will rise an <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra 10 percent</span> in most of those years, the CBO estimates.
If this happens, it will feed the talking points of both political parties, Blendon, the Harvard professor, predicts. “The big-picture issues will be premiums increasing and dropping coverage,” he said.
But for now, Antos says, the unexpectedly high number of people enrolling in ACA plans, in a year when insurance choices shrank, premium costs rose and the White House became a megaphone for criticism of the law, suggests that the law remains “durable.”
“I don’t see big lurches in either direction for both political and practical reasons,” he added. “It’s hard to move the ship once it’s moving.”

When a key economic input suddenly becomes scarce, it’s called a supply shock: It pushes costs up and economic activity down.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">This helps explain why markets have responded so badly to President Donald Trump’s announcement of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 25% tariff</span> on steel imports <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 10% on</span> aluminum.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Like a geopolitical shock that reduces the supply of oil, it’s bad for both inflation and growth.
</span>To be sure, the direct macroeconomic effect of Mr. Trump’s tariffs look to be slim. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Net imports of steel and aluminum are <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 0.2% of</span> gross domestic product, compared <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 0.3% for</span> oil.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Barclays estimates the tariff will <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">add 0.1 percentage</span> point to inflation and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">subtract 0.1 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.2 percentage</span> point from economic growth, for one year.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">But those small direct impacts are exacerbated by what the tariffs symbolize for Mr. Trump’s agenda and the broader global economy.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">By following his nationalist instincts Mr. Trump has broken with the pro-business factions in his administration and his party whose policy priorities have been critical to the upswing in business and investor sentiment since he was elected.</span> By willingly hurting U.S. allies over a problem of overcapacity that is mainly China’s doing, he’s cast further uncertainty over the U.S. role as global leader.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Market action over Thursday and Friday neatly captures these cross currents.
</span>Shares of steel and aluminum makers went up, while shares of companies that consume them, such as automobile, aircraft and construction equipment makers went down. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Because consumers are more important to the economy than producers, the overall market went down.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">With investors already on edge about Federal Reserve interest rate increases, the steel tariffs at the margin compound inflation pressure.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That effect is so far too small to alter the Fed’s calculus, but a tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation could lead to even more inflation and rate increases than investors or the Fed have anticipated.
</span>Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs to produce more steel and aluminum at home to safeguard national security. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">If so, that comes at a price, just as Japan’s longtime insistence on growing its own rice cost the Japanese in pricier food.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Firms can produce more at lower cost by serving a global rather than just a domestic market.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Protectionism shrinks markets, raises costs, and reduces how fast a country can grow without generating inflation.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">U.S. steel and aluminum companies can meet the demand previously filled by imports, but with unemployment at a 17-year low that may require hiring workers away from other industries, putting upward pressure on wages.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">This is good news in the short run for workers, but bad news for any consumer who must now pay more for cars or beer cans.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Thus on Thursday and Friday, Treasury bond yields began to discount slightly higher inflation and slightly slower growth.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Because tariffs reduce the foreign currency needed to buy imports they are supposed to lead to a stronger dollar, but in fact the dollar fell in the wake of the tariff news.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Investors speculated that the angry reaction of American allies, in particular the European Union, showed U.S. global leadership is fading and with it the dollar’s appeal as a reserve currency.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“If you start a global trade war, the dollars required for global trade activity falls,” said one fund manager.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The tariffs may also lead to a broader rethink of just how beneficial Mr. Trump is to the economy.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump campaigned as a nationalist whose anti-immigration and anti-free trade views were at odds with business and establishment Republicans.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Once in office, he hired business executives and prioritized deregulation and tax cuts.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is one reason surveys of business sentiment are so buoyant relative to actual economic activity.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But that pro-business side is now taking a back seat to a less business-friendly nationalist agenda, which is denting investor sentiment.
</span>It may be premature to predict a long-term impact. The tariffs haven’t been finalized and Mr. Trump could yet soften the sting. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">China may move more quickly to curb its overcapacity, the root of the import surge and price pressure that is hurting U.S. producers.</span> Yet the decision has generated conflict within his own administration, his party and with key U.S. allies that, at least at the margin, counteracts the boost from the rest of his agenda.

American employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate as a resurgent coronavirus and the absence of new federal aid take a toll on economic growth.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Thursday <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 886,000 Americans</span> filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, an increase of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 77,000 from</span> the previous week.</span> Adjusted for seasonal variations, the total <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 898,000.</span>
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">After dropping in late spring and early summer as pandemic-related lockdowns eased, new claims for state jobless benefits had been steadily totaling <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 800,000 a</span> week.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It’s discouraging,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</span> “We’re still stuck at a level of claims that’s far higher than it was during the worst of what followed the crash <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2008.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The labor market appears to be stalled, which underscores the need for new stimulus as quickly as possible.”
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program that covers freelancers, self-employed workers, part-timers and others who don’t qualify for benefits under the regular unemployment system, were tallied <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 373,000,</span> down <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 474,000.</span></span> Most of the decline reflected an aberration in Arizona, which has been dealing with fraud issues in the program and reported no new claims.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The data do not include fresh figures for California, which has temporarily stopped accepting new unemployment applications to address a huge processing backlog and weed out fraud.</span> Instead, the report incorporated the last weekly figures available.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The lack of fresh data from California makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, but the latest numbers “point to a lot of churn in the labor market, and it appears the rate of firings has picked up,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Over the past month, large employers including United Airlines, Disney and Allstate announced tens of thousands of layoffs, and more are expected as sectors like leisure and hospitality struggle.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In some states, restaurants have salvaged some business by serving diners outside, but many will lose that option as temperatures fall.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Despite the widespread economic pain, Republicans and Democrats in Washington have been unable to agree on a new relief package, a failure that may cause the economy to slow further in the coming months.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Federal benefits created in March to supplement state payments to the unemployed are set to expire by the end of the year.
</span>Steven Mnuchin says he will back the Democrats’ testing proposal, but hurdles remain in reaching a deal.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Speaking on CNBC, the Treasury secretary said that he would agree to the language that Democrats had insisted on when it came to a coronavirus testing program and noted that the two sides had already agreed to spend an <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $75 billion</span> on testing and contact tracing.</span> The specifics of such a program have been an obstacle in the talks.
“We’ll fundamentally agree with their testing language, subject to some minor issues,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We need to get money to the American public now.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary is expected to speak to Ms. Pelosi later on Thursday.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Mr. Mnuchin’s remarks came after the Labor Department reported that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits jumped <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 886,000 last</span> week.
</span>But significant hurdles remain in reaching a deal, including Republican resistance to what the White House is willing to support. On Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged it would be difficult to pass and enact a deal in the next three weeks.
In the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more “targeted” relief bill.
Negotiators have been locked in fruitless talks for months. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin assailed Democrats for letting politics get in the way of reaching agreement before the election, though President Trump scuttled the talks himself when he said in a tweet last week that he had called off stimulus negotiations until after the election.</span> The majority of Senate Republicans have also warned that they cannot accept the <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">latest $1.8 trillion</span> framework Mr. Mnuchin has put forward, even as Ms. Pelosi insists that plan is inadequate.
Mr. Mnuchin also called on Congress to give him the authority to repurpose <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately $300 billion</span> in unused relief money from the legislation that was passed in March. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">He said he could begin getting that money into the economy this week.

More and more Americans are relying on a federal program designed to help the jobless as state unemployment benefits run out.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The program, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, was created by Congress in March to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">provide 13 weeks</span> of aid when regular state unemployment benefits expire — typically <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 26 weeks</span>.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">It has now been more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 weeks</span> since unemployment claims spiked in March, when the pandemic first forced the economy into lockdown mode, so millions of unemployed Americans are starting to qualify for the extended benefits.
</span>But getting on the rolls isn’t easy, experts say. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“The transition from regular state benefits to P.E.U.C. is not going smoothly,” said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In some places, recipients of state unemployment benefits haven’t been notified of their eligibility for the federal extension, and aging computer systems have slowed the processing of applications.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Still, in the week that ended Sept.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 26,</span> the most recent period with available data, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2.8 million</span> people were getting Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits, a jump from fewer than two million the previous week.</span> That increase was roughly equal to the decline in the number collecting state benefits.
The federal program is set to expire at the end of the year, and if it is not extended by Congress, “we’re going to see a disaster,” Ms. Shierholz said. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">“There will be a huge drop in living standards and an increase in poverty as well as downward pressure on economic growth.”
</span>For those who qualify, the program has helped as they search for work.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Jared Gaxiola of Torrance, Calif., was laid off from his job as a freelance lighting technician in March, after live events were canceled across the country.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">When Mr. Gaxiola’s state benefits ran out in mid-September, he was able to get a 13-week extension through Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Mr. Gaxiola,<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35,</span> hopes to find a job by the time the payments run out again in December.</span> But with entertainment work still scarce, he worries about how he will pay his rent in the new year.
“I could probably borrow money from my sister if I needed to,” Mr. Gaxiola said. “But I really don’t want to have to do that.”

Before the pandemic struck, Chloe Ezi was a lifeguard at a public aquatic center in Powder Springs, Ga. It was part-time work, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $11 an</span> hour, but she was able to bring in an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra $300 a</span> week by teaching private swim lessons.
In March, Ms. Ezi was sent home for three months when the aquatic center closed during coronavirus lockdowns. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Because she continued to be paid half her wages — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $75 a</span> week — the pool told her that she was not eligible to file for unemployment benefits.
</span>Ms. Ezi,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> was called back to work in May, but because virus restrictions kept her from teaching private swim lessons, she was able to bring in only <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $150 a</span> week — barely enough to cover <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">her $280 monthly</span> car insurance bill, <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">her $80 cellphone</span> bill, <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $100 monthly</span> payments to Penn Foster College, where she is completing a dental assistant certificate program, plus groceries and other necessities.
“That’s not a lot to live off of,” Ms. Ezi said. “I was zeroing out my paycheck every month.”
To save money, Ms. Ezi lived with her boyfriend in his parents’ house.
“We’re all just a big family living in this house together,” she said. “It can get pretty stressful living with so many people like this.”
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Tired of living in such close quarters, Ms. Ezi began looking for a job that would pay more.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">In August, she found a full-time position as a sales representative at a store that sells birding equipment, where she <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">makes $13 an</span> hour plus tips.</span> She remains on the staff at the pool, where she still picks up an occasional shift.
Now she and her boyfriend can afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Smyrna, Ga. They moved in on Wednesday.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">“My new job allowed us to finally get our own place,” she said.</span> “I’m feeling pretty proud of myself right now.”
For three years, Lea Polizzi worked more <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 hours</span> a week as a nanny and a freelance photographer in New York City. But in March, when the pandemic hit, the family she worked for on the Upper East Side left the city, and all of her photography gigs dried up.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">Ms. Polizzi,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span></span> filed for unemployment benefits and started receiving <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $200 a</span> week from the state, as well as <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $600 federal</span> supplement.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Those payments enabled her to meet expenses — including <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,100 rent</span> for her apartment in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn — while she looked for a job.
</span>But <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $600 payments</span> expired at the end of July. Since then, Ms. Polizzi has used <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75 percent</span> of her savings — <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $4,000 </span>— to pay bills.
“That was the money I had saved to use for vacations or emergency funds,” Ms. Polizzi said. “I was going to buy a new camera. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">And then as soon as everything started going down, I had to put everything on hold, because I knew that I was going to end up having to pay rent with it eventually.”
Ms. Polizzi recently <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $900 from</span> Lost Wages Assistance, a short-term supplement from the federal government, and she expects one more payment from the program in the next few weeks.
</span>In the meantime, she has taken matters into her own hands. She is making masks, lingerie, hats and jewelry and selling the items online <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $25 to</span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $200 apiece</span>.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">She has made <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 60 sales</span>.</span> “Hopefully, I’ll be able to make it work and just pay all my bills through my art ventures,” she said.

<span id=""39"" class=""red"">It didn’t seem to help that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election.</span> Mr. Mnuchin had dampened sentiment in the markets Wednesday by cautioning that he didn’t expect a relief package before the Nov.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 election</span>.
<span id=""40"" class=""red"">Mr. Mnuchin’s comments came as data from the Labor Department showed that new state unemployment claims jumped last week to <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 900,000,</span> a figure that highlights the fact that employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate.
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">The slide in markets on Thursday is “linked to spikes in coronavirus cases and fears that regional lockdowns will subdue the economic recovery,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</span> “We are seeing fresh losses for airlines and travel stocks.”
Shares of European airlines, Lufthansa and easyJet, fell sharply. Ryanair tumbled after saying it would fly <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 40 percent</span> of its usual capacity this winter, down from previous plans <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 60 percent</span>.

On the afternoon of Feb.<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span></span> President Trump declared on Twitter that the coronavirus was “very much under control” in the United States, but hours earlier, senior members of the president’s economic team, privately addressing board members of the conservative Hoover Institution, were less confident.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">Tomas J. Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy.</span> To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time.
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">The next day, board members — many of them Republican donors — got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.</span> Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and “it’s pretty close to airtight,” Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was “contained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don’t know,” according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times.
The document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover’s board, was stark. “What struck me,” the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus “as a point of concern, totally unprovoked.”
The consultant’s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president’s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.
<span id=""45"" class=""red"">Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering.
</span>To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country.
<span id=""46"" class=""red"">“Short everything,” was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.

Americans used one-time stimulus checks they received from the federal government early in the pandemic to pad their savings accounts and pay off debt, new research from the Federal Reserve shows.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">Households spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 29 percent</span> of the money they received earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a post on its website, citing its Survey of Consumer Expectations, conducted in June and August.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Another 36 percent</span> of the cash was saved, <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 35 percent</span> was used to pay down debt.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Americans adults who qualified for the stimulus received up <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,200 each</span>, with an <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra $500 added</span> per child in the household.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">Out of the Fed’s sample,<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 89 percent</span> of households received money.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">Poorer families and those who lost jobs or income amid the pandemic were more likely to use their money to pay down debts, while richer families saved the money.
</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">“The economic impact payments, by increasing both household income and the debt pay down, contributed importantly to the sharp increase in the overall saving rate during the early months of the pandemic,” the central bank’s researchers wrote in the post.
</span>Several factors might have been behind the relatively low spending and high saving. <span id=""54"" class=""red"">People were unsure when the economic crisis would clear up, the researchers wrote, and might have been acting cautiously.</span> They were on lockdown, which might have limited opportunities to spend, and some rent payments — which count as consumption — were delayed.
<span id=""55"" class=""red"">The trends seem unlikely to change if new aid becomes available: In the August survey, the New York Fed asked what households might do if they received <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $1,500 check</span>.</span> Respondents expect to spend even less of that money, <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 24 percent</span>.

16121,"<h3>U.S., Canada and Mexico just reached a sweeping new NAFTA deal. Here’s what’s in it.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sunday night, President Trump got his wish for a significantly revised North American trade deal.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">After more than a year of intense negotiations, the United States, Canada and Mexico reached an agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1994 pact</span> that governs more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.2 trillion</span> worth of trade among the three nations.
</span>The new deal won’t go into effect right away. Most of the key provisions don’t start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2020 because</span> leaders from the three countries have to sign it and then Congress and the legislatures in Canada and Mexico have to approve it, a process that is expected to take months.
Here’s a rundown of what’s in the “new NAFTA.”
New name. Goodbye NAFTA. The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Trump, who had long disdained NAFTA, had suggested that he might call it the “USMC,” in honor of the U.S. Marine Corps, but in the end, USMCA won out.
Big changes for cars. The goal of the new deal is to have more cars and truck parts made in North America. Starting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 75 percent</span> of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 62.5 percent</span> requirement.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">[Winners and losers of Trump's new trade deal with Canada and Mexico]
There’s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $16 an</span> hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Starting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> cars and trucks should have at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 30 percent</span> of the work on the vehicle done by workers <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $16 an</span> hour.</span> That gradually moves up <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 40 percent</span> for cars <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2023.</span>
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">While many economists think these new rules will help some North American workers, they also warn that car prices might rise and some small cars may no longer be made in North America because they would be too expensive under the new requirements.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">There are also concerns that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Trump’s victory: Canada opens up its milk market to U.S. farmers.</span> Trump tweeted often about how unfair he thought it was that Canada charged such high tariffs on U.S. dairy products. Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don’t go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high.</span> Trump didn’t like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers.</span> U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Class 7 dairy</span> products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).
Canada’s victory: <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 19,</span> allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said repeatedly that he wanted to keep <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 19 in</span> place, and that’s exactly what happened. The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.
<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 19 allows</span> Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court.</span> Over the years, Canada has successfully used <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 19 to</span> challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.
Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won’t pound them with auto tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap hefty tariffs on car and vehicle parts coming from overseas into the United States. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Along with the new trade deal, his administration signed “side letters” allowing the two nations to mostly dodge Trump’s auto tariffs.
</span>The side letters say Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.
Trump’s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 25 percent</span> tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn’t happen — yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a “completely separate track.” Trudeau has called the steel tariffs “insulting and unacceptable” because the two nations are such close allies.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Improved labor and environmental rights.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico.</span> For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen — a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.
</span>Increased intellectual property protections. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The new IP chapter <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 63 pages</span> and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">negotiated 25 years</span> ago.
</span>Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada. U.S. drug companies will now be able to sell pharmaceuticals in Canada <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 years</span> before facing generic competition. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That’s up from eight years of so-called “market protection” now.
</span>Deal must be reviewed <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 years</span>. The USMCA stipulates that the three nations will review the agreement after six years. If all parties agree it’s still good, then the deal will continue for the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">full 16 year</span> period (with the ability to renew after that for <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 16 years</span>). This was a compromise provision: Trump wanted ability to renegotiate the deal frequently. Ultimately, there will be a review, but it won’t happen until after Trump leaves office.
<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11,</span> giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 is</span></span> eliminated entirely for Canada and mostly for Mexico, except for some key industries such as energy and telecommunications. <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 gave</span> companies and investors a special process to resolve disputes with one of the governments in NAFTA. The idea was that if investors put a lot of money into a project and then the government changed the rules, there was a clear dispute process — outside the court system — where investors could get their problem resolved.
Critics argue that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 was</span> mainly used as a way for big corporations to get taxpayer money, but businesses say it was necessary to ensure they weren’t harmed by sudden changes when new governments came into power in Mexico, Canada or the United States. In the end, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 is</span></span> mostly gone, except for a few key industries, such as oil, that lobbied hard to be able to challenge the Mexican government if it changes the rules and tries to nationalize its energy sector again.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Winners

■ High-income earners.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The plan would reduce the top rate on individual income tax — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 39.6 percent</span> for income over <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $470,000 for</span> a married couple — <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 35 percent</span></span>.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But that’s only part of the gain for high-income earners.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It also would eliminate <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.8 percent</span> tax, used to help fund Obamacare, that applies to investment income <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $250,000 for</span> a couple.
</span>■ People with creative accountants. <span id=""9"" class=""red""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 15 percent</span> business tax rate could open a huge loophole for people to receive business income through a limited liability company or other pass-through entity instead of as wages.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Depending on how the law is drafted, that could enable some people to pay that <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">low 15 percent</span> rate on their earnings instead of an individual income rate up <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 35 percent</span></span>.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">People who already receive their income through investment vehicles wouldn’t have to change anything for a windfall.

</span>■ Donald J. Trump.

71054,"<h3>A Tale of Two Steel Firms and Their Diverging Paths Under Trump’s Tariffs</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Profits and raises are back at one, while the other is cutting costs and delaying investments

Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 7</span>:00 am ET

Nearly a year after the U.S. imposed tariffs on imported steel, the higher prices have been a godsend for Byer Steel Co.</span> The family-owned Ohio company last year posted its first profit in four years and surprised workers with year-end bonuses.

The tariffs “are giving us the ability to get off our knees for a minute,” said Burke Byer, whose great-grandfather founded the Cincinnati company a century ago. “We’re not so hand-to-mouth.”

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The same tariffs have pinched another small family business:</span> Laclede Chain Manufacturing Co. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The St. Louis-based maker of steel chains had been on a growth spurt before higher steel prices forced it to refocus on cost cutting.

</span>Surcharges have helped offset higher raw-material costs but don’t “make us whole,” said Tim Riley, president of the 165-year-old company. Laclede put off plans to add a third shift at its Vicksburg, Miss., plant and delayed <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1 million</span> investment in new equipment.

The shifting fortunes of these two businesses show how steel tariffs imposed last year have created opportunities for some and challenges for others. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Both companies say that business has stabilized since the trade conflict ratcheted up last summer, but add that planning remains difficult amid uncertainties about U.S. trade policy over the long term.

</span>“The real-world challenge all of us are asking is, what does the long-term sustainable world look like without these tariffs,” said Mr. Byer, who ran the company <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 years</span>. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He sold the business earlier this month to his sister.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The U.S. is dispatching its chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing this week to continue talks ahead of a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 1 deadline</span> to reach an accord.</span> President Trump is “highly unlikely” to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the deadline, a White House official said Thursday.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">For now, steelmakers’ profits are up, though foreign steel continues to account for a significant share of the U.S. steel market.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The January average price for hot-rolled U.S.-made steel, an industry benchmark, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 17% above</span> its <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017 lows</span>, though prices have fallen significantly from last year’s highs.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">For some U.S. manufacturers, the pain of higher steel costs has been eased by tariffs imposed in September <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span> of Chinese imports.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Byer Steel now has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 130 employees</span>, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 20 hired</span> last year.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $45 million</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 30% increase</span>.</span> “We can start thinking about the future,” said Mr. Byer.

With more cash in its coffers, Byer Steel handed out the first pay raises in two years and year-end bonuses <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaging 5%.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">It also sweetened its health-insurance coverage, added overtime and began offering <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">employees $500 bonuses</span> for referring new hires.

</span>The company, which heats railroad-car axles and rolls them into “rebar,” reinforcing bar used in construction, has overhauled its furnaces and cooling, cutting and bundling operation. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Byer, which also recycles scrap, bought out some leases and paid down debt.

</span>But profit margins started to shrink late in the fourth quarter, and new U.S. production is coming online.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Byer Steel is holding off on investments that aren’t crucial to its ongoing operation, such as <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $6 million</span> advanced material-processing system that would boost productivity, product quality and worker safety.

</span>“It’s difficult, given the uncertainties right now, to make long-term strategic decisions,” said Byer Steel President Jonas Allen.

Three hundred fifty miles away, Laclede Chain is also grappling with uncertainty. The company bends, shapes and welds steel rod into chains used for hoisting, tie-downs and tire traction.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Sales at the company’s largest unit <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 10% in</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 compared</span> with the previous year, with business <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 25% in</span> the first quarter and then flat for the rest of the year.

</span>Keeping costs down has taken precedence over boosting output. Laclede is currently upgrading a small computer used in manufacturing so that it provides more real-time data on the quality of output, which could reduce waste. To limit costs, the work is being done by an internal team instead of an outside contractor.

Laclede has replaced a companywide incentive program, based on monthly targets, with more frequent department-specific measures, such as pounds produced per day. Workers now “can see the target clearly on a display every day so they can see what their progress is,” Mr. Riley said. “It makes it easier for them to visualize the goal for the week, month and quarter.”

Fears the company would lose orders because of higher costs haven’t materialized. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Tariffs imposed in September on steel chains imported from China have reduced the price gap between Laclede’s U.S.-made chains and Chinese products.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Prices have gone up,” said Mr. Riley.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">“Customers have had to keep doing business.</span> They’ve adjusted to the new normal.”

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Laclede now <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 205 employees</span>, up five from its recent low in June, and has added some overtime to keep up with demand, which rose <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5% in</span> January compared with the previous year.

</span>Given all the uncertainty, customers are on the fence about placing large orders or moving forward with bigger projects, Mr. Riley said. “This year we are starting to grow again,” he added. “We are in a good situation, but we don’t know how long it will last.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Analysts said Mr. Trump’s comments were unlikely to sway the Fed’s rate-setting decisions, and if anything, they could backfire by forcing the central bank to affirm its independence.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Marc Sumerlin, managing partner at economic consulting firm Evenflow Macro, said the already-high likelihood of a rate increase in September had climbed higher after Mr. Trump’s remarks.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“If the president publicly tells a Fed chair to stop, they have to keep going,” said Mr. Sumerlin, who served as an adviser to former President George W. Bush.</span> “Trump’s being counterproductive to his own goal because any time a president says publicly to stop, a central bank can’t.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Even if the president’s unhappiness doesn’t influence the Fed, the comments risk calling the Fed’s independence into question if the central bank, on its own, concluded it needed to slow its gradual pace of rate increases, analysts said.
</span>Central bankers have long argued for independence from political pressure. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They said it gives investors greater confidence that officials will make unpopular decisions in the long-run best interest of the economy—such as raising rates to curb inflation—as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Political pressure on former Fed chairmen William McChesney Martin by the Johnson administration and on Arthur Burns by the Nixon administration to follow easy-money policies is widely blamed for the inflation surges of the 1970s.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed is charged by Congress to maximize employment and maintain stable prices, and its leadership today seeks inflation <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2% because</span> it sees that level as reflecting a healthy economy.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">With the economy expanding solidly and the unemployment rate falling to its lowest levels in decades, the central bank has been gradually raising rates from historically very low levels to keep growth on an even keel.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Both of the Fed’s rate increases this year have been approved unanimously.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump has filled two of seven seats on the Fed’s board of governors, which has four vacancies.</span> The Senate hasn’t yet confirmed Mr. Trump’s three additional nominees, all of whom have said they won’t allow political considerations to influence their decision-making.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">The upshot is that Mr. Trump has few means to directly influence the Fed.</span> If all the president’s remaining nominees were confirmed, he would have only one vacancy left to fill on the board.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Fed governors serve fixed terms and cannot be removed from office by the president because of a policy dispute.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, now at the Brookings Institution, said he didn’t expect Mr. Trump’s comments Thursday to influence Mr. Powell, who goes by Jay.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“I’m completely confident that the Fed, under Jay’s leadership, will continue to do whatever is necessary to achieve its dual mandate,” he said.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The president, who has previously expressed support for a weaker dollar, said he was frustrated that rising interest rates had caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen against other currencies.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Europe’s “making money easy, and their currency is falling,” Mr. Trump told CNBC.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">“China, their currency is dropping like a rock.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Our currency is going up.</span> I have to tell you, it puts us at a disadvantage.”
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">A stronger greenback makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive on world markets.
</span>The dollar weakened slightly against other major currencies when CNBC aired Mr. Trump’s remarks, with the WSJ Dollar Index moving lower shortly <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 1 p</span>.m. EDT. It later recouped some of those losses.
Mr. Powell, who hasn’t met with or spoken to Mr. Trump since his confirmation, said last week he wasn’t worried about political pressure from the White House.
“We have a long tradition here of conducting policy … independent of all political concerns. Wedo our work in a strictly nonpolitical way, based on detailed analysis, which we put on the record transparently,” Mr. Powell said in an interview with American Public Media’s “Marketplace” radio program.
The nonpolitical approach “is deep in our DNA,” Mr. Powell added.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">The Fed cut its benchmark rate to near zero to boost demand after <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis, and it held the rate there far longer than many observers expected.</span> Officials began to gradually lift rates in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015.</span> Last fall, the central bank also began to slowly shrink <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $4.3 trillion</span> bond portfolio it amassed during several rounds of asset purchases designed to lower long-term rates and further stimulate growth.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">While former President Ronald Reagan was reluctant to publicly question Mr. Volcker, his White House frequently criticized Fed policy and nominated several governors who outvoted Mr. Volcker, a rare rebuke.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Former President George H.W. Bush, when he was vice president and seeking the presidency <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1988,</span> fretted publicly that the Fed might take steps to slow the economy.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Some White House officials blamed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for not cutting rates quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession, which they thought cost Mr. Bush <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 1992 re</span>-election bid.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1993,</span> a top adviser to then-President Bill Clinton began enforcing a rule within the White House that the Fed’s policy decisions shouldn’t be publicly questioned.</span> That rule largely held under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It also was followed until this year in Mr. Trump’s White House.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn emphasized to colleagues the importance to markets of not publicly second-guessing monetary policy decisions.</span> He left the White House in April.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">After a portion of Mr. Trump’s interview aired on Thursday, a White House spokeswoman issued a statement that read in part, “Of course the president respects the independence of the Fed.”
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said during the interview that he knew some people didn’t think it was appropriate for the president to comment on interest rates or the dollar, but he said of those concerns, “I couldn’t care less what they say.”
At a conference in Sweden earlier this year, Mr. Powell said an erosion of trust in public institutions had created special challenges for central banks.</span> Those institutions “cannot take our measure of independence for granted,” he said.

869,"<h3>Jobless Rate Revisions a Sign of a Slowdown</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Unexpectedly dismal job growth last month cast a shadow on the nation’s economy, as a government report on Friday sent analysts scrambling for adjectives like “dreadful,” “a body blow” and “grim” to describe just how disappointing they found the latest employment figures.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Labor Department found that the jobless rate held steady <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5.1 percent</span> in September, but wage gains stalled, the labor force shrank and employers created many fewer positions than they had been averaging in recent months.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While the latest report is only a snapshot of the economy and the weakness may ultimately prove fleeting, it made clear that ordinary workers are still failing to take home the kind of monetary rewards normally expected from a recovery that has being going on for more than six years.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The new estimates came just two weeks after the Federal Reserve decided that the economy’s advance remained too fragile to risk lifting interest rates from their near-zero level — even as it hinted an increase would come before the year’s end.</span> Now, experts said, signs of a slowdown may well push any rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 2016.</span>
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The odds of a move in December have “clearly diminished,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.</span> “There’s nothing good in this morning’s report.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Despite the lagging economy, the mere likelihood that the Fed would yet again postpone a retreat on its stimulus program may have ultimately buoyed some investors’ confidence.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">After opening sharply down after the Labor Department’s announcement, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index turned around, ending the day up <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 1.4 percent</span>, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1,951.36.</span></span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond dipped <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 2 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“That may assure the markets that unconditional support from monetary policy will be sustained,” Mr. Tannenbaum said.</span> “Low for long may go on even longer.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, had “really made it clear that she’d like to re-engage those sidelined in recent years by allowing the unemployment rate to fall below what most consider full employment.</span> It’s the only way we’re going to regain living standards lost in recent years.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed faces an uphill battle, she and other analysts suggested, as the United States now appears to be importing some of the economic malaise that has infected other parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.
Ms. Swonk, who labeled the employment numbers a “body blow,” warned that the economy was likely to be plagued by subpar growth for a while.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Industry has been hurt by the strong dollar and weak global demand; the oil industry has cut back sharply on investment in response to the fall in energy prices; and farming has suffered because of slumping agricultural commodity prices.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Last month, the sectors that absorbed the greatest job losses were mining, logging and manufacturing.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">By contrast, health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services remained strong, highlighting other signs of sturdiness in the economy that countered the otherwise disheartening jobs news.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Consumer demand at home has been on the upswing and vehicle sales have been strong.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">And a broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, dipped <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 percent</span> in September, its lowest mark since <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Against the backdrop of accelerating real consumption, it’s hard to see what’s driving this softening and what could sustain it,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sounding a more optimistic note.</span> “We have to expect better numbers next month, and the odds still strongly favor upward revisions, despite the unexpected downward revision to August.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">But Mr. Shepherdson was drowned out by a chorus of more negative reactions to the estimate that employers created <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 142,000 jobs</span> in September.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Adding to the gloom, the Labor Department revised August’s employment numbers, registering <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 136,000 new</span> jobs for that month, well below <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 173,000 originally</span> reported.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">With Friday’s revision, job gains have averaged <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 167,000 a</span> month for the last three months, compared with an average of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 260,000 for</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014.</span></span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Average hourly wages in the private sector dropped slightly, as did the average length of the workweek.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">With the presidential campaign already underway, neither party wasted much time in using the jobs report to attack the other side.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Republicans criticized the president for promoting a program that they argue stifles economic growth.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The slowdown may provide a political opening for Republican contenders to attack Mr. Obama and the Democrats on an issue that was not resonating as much with voters when the job market was on the upswing.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">In response, President Obama vowed on Friday not to sign another temporary spending measure after the one passed this week in an effort to raise the pressure on Congress to reach a long-term agreement to finance the government.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Obama warned that the economy could be endangered by the continual game of budget chicken encouraged by conservative Republicans in hopes of forcing Democrats to give ground on other issues, like health care and the fate of Planned Parenthood.
</span>The short-term spending bill passed this week to pay for government operations only until Dec.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> he said, was a “gimmick” that “sets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.” He added: “This is not the way the U.S. should be operating.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">To prevent a recurrence, he said he would veto any further budget measures postponing a full-fledged spending plan.</span> “I will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week,” Mr. Obama said. “We purchased ourselves <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 weeks</span>. We need to use them.”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">While overall growth remains on a slow but steady track, the job outlook varies markedly depending on geography, training and industry.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Looking at the feeble rise in median wages, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, pointed out that such figures masked a wide disparity among industries.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Workers in financial services, construction and graphic design, for example, have on average enjoyed double-digit wage growth from the previous year.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Those stuck in neutral or suffering from effective wage declines included those in the manufacturing, retail clothing and textile industries.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The demand for young, high-technology workers has been evident to Isaac Oates, the chief executive of Justworks, a human resources management company that handles mostly small businesses.</span> “We see that a lot of companies are growing quickly” in this area, saying his own firm has grown <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 60 workers</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 40 over</span> the past three months in order to keep pace.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">Other industries, like travel and leisure, have proved more resilient job creators, even if wages have not grown much.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">An improving housing market has also helped push down the number of unemployed workers with construction experience to its lowest level <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2000,</span> according to the Associated General Contractors of America.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">The picture is bleaker for those in the low-skill corners of the economy.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“We’re still finding a lot of skilled jobs come open, but it’s certainly slowed down for the unskilled,” said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 750 offices</span>.
</span>Skilled workers are at a premium at Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing consulting company based in Peoria, Ill.
“Where we’re struggling is in the area of talented people in manufacturing,” Jeff Owens, the company’s president, said, mentioning that he would like to add <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 160 managers</span>, electricians, information technology workers and machinists to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 3,300</span>-person staff.
Location also matters. Mr. Funk, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he observed a slowing down in the last six weeks, with the biggest drop-offs in the oil-drilling states, including Texas, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Others fear that the economy is never going to deliver many gains to workers who have been waiting years to receive any bounty from the upswing in business activity.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: “We’ve pretty much reached a kind of stability, and the unemployment rate will continue to fall, mostly because of retirements.”
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">An analysis this week from Morgan Stanley noted that the decline in the unemployment rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5.1 percent</span> in August, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.5 percent</span> in May, was almost entirely attributable to changes in the labor force participation rate.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">The percentage of the working-age population that is employed — which many economists consider a better indicator of the health of the job market than the official jobless figure — has stayed flat at <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 60 percent</span> for several years, still well below its prerecession level of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 63.</span>
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">Public sector jobs were one of the few bright spots, growing <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 24,000 in</span> September, thanks to hiring on the state and local level.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">But government workers — from teachers to police officers to transit workers — have not made up the lost ground, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization in Washington.
</span>“The number of teachers and education staff fell dramatically during the recession,” Ms. Gould said, “and has failed to recover to anywhere near its prerecession level, let alone the level that would be required to keep up with an expanding student population.”
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the economy.</span> It is heading into the final quarter <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span> of course — <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">not 2016.</span>"

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Several signs suggest that investors are responding rationally to signs of fundamental problems for China’s economy
SHANGHAI—This year’s selloff in China’s stocks and currency is reviving painful memories of the country’s last market rout, in the summer <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015.</span></span> If anything, things look more worrying this time around.
Shares in Shanghai are the world’s worst performing among major markets this year, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">tumbling 17%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The yuan has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slumped 3.6% against</span> the dollar since the start of June, pushed down by a combination of selling by nervous investors and the Chinese central bank’s efforts to guide the currency lower as a trade conflict with the U.S. escalates.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">On paper, even those big market moves pale in comparison <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2015.</span></span> Three years ago the Shanghai Composite Index lost nearly half its value in the two months starting in June, bottoming out only in early 2016: They have never since regained their mid-2015 highs. The central bank also shocked markets with an <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">abrupt 2% devaluation</span> of the yuan in August that year.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">More concerning this time round is that several factors, including Beijing’s campaign against high debt levels and its trade war with the U.S., suggest that investors are responding rationally to signs of fundamental problems for China’s economy.
</span>The U.S. placed tariffs <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $34 billion</span> worth of Chinese goods at midnight Eastern time on Friday. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And while Shanghai stocks <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose .5% on</span> Friday, their fall this year has accelerated since trade tensions ramped up in the spring.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">By contrast, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 the</span> market boom and bust was driven by retail investors who—initially with government encouragement—had taken on piles of debt to bet on stocks, then rushed to sell when the market cooled.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 2015 market</span> crash was like unexpectedly catching a fever that came fast but also went fast.</span> What we are witnessing this time is a likely protracted decline,” said Landing Zhang, chief executive of Shanghai asset-management firm CYAMLAN Investment.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">One big difference between this year <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2015 is</span> that institutional investors, who typically take a longer-term view of markets, appear to be driving the equity-market selloff.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">No breakdown of market trading by investor class is available, but a couple of factors indicate professionals are in the lead.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">First, much of this year’s Shanghai market slump is due to falling share prices of major state-owned Chinese companies such as Citic Securities and Baoshan Iron & Steel.</span> Such blue-chip stocks are normally favored by big institutional investors.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“The latest selloff was definitely led by institutions, because in the past when the market fell, blue chips often bucked the trend.</span> This time around, blue chips are falling, too, and it has been like a stampede,” said Amy Lin, a senior analyst at brokerage Capital Securities.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">A sharp fall in the use of margin finance, which enables investors to bet on stocks with borrowed money, is a sign that China’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 90 million</span> retail investors have had relatively less influence over this year’s market slump.</span> The value of margin loans outstanding is down <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 908.9 billion</span> yuan ($137 billion) as of Thursday, less than half the <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 2.1 trillion</span> yuan right before <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 summer</span> rout.
“Nobody, including myself and many of my friends, wants to invest in anything. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">There’s no confidence, and we are in no mood,” said Wu Yunfeng, a retail investor from Shanghai who said he hasn’t invested in stocks since last year.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Institutional investors’ increasingly pessimistic view of China’s outlook has started being borne out by economic data.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Despite solid growth in the first quarter, figures for May showed a slowdown in areas including investment and retail sales.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Beijing’s campaign against shadow-banking activity more than halved China’s overall credit supply in May.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“The economy was in better shape <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> and the stock market had rallied for a long time before the crash.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">There was also no trade war at that time,” Ms. Lin said.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">For some, the market gloom is an overdue reflection of the difficult task policy makers in Beijing face in trying to juggle a financial-system housecleaning while protecting economic growth—all against the backdrop of a trade war.
</span>China’s central bank has faced a dilemma when it comes to managing the yuan’s level against the dollar, too. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Rising U.S. interest rates and slowing Chinese growth have created market pressure for the yuan to fall.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Beijing may be happy to see the yuan slide, in part to offset any impact on its exports as trade tensions rise.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Still, policy makers are eager not to let the yuan drop too far, too fast, in case that encourages heavy capital outflows that could cause a liquidity shortage in China’s financial system.
</span>“It does make sense to witness a shift in sentiment because we were always surprised by how sanguine Beijing has looked with its deleveraging campaign. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">We didn’t think it was priced in by the market,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Singapore-based economist at research firm Capital Economics.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Investor uncertainty over whether Beijing can pull off a deleveraging of China’s economy and avoid a significant slowdown has deepened amid some mixed signs from policy makers.</span> While authorities have tried to cut back on credit by shadow-banking institutions, they have also freed up more funds for bank lending three times this year.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">“The government wants to guide more money into the real economy, but it hasn’t been easy because investors aren’t showing lots of confidence in Chinese companies, especially those in the manufacturing sector,” said CYAMLAN Investment’s Mr. Zhang.

35510,"<h3>In Trump country, a group of coal miners rebel over lost jobs, missed paychecks</h3>CUMBERLAND, Ky. — Sitting in lawn chairs plopped in the middle of train tracks, two coal miners smoked and chewed tobacco to pass the time. There’s been little else to do here for the past four weeks, except wave at motorists who honk in support of these homegrown heroes waging a national struggle over workers’ rights.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Since Chris Rowe and Chris Sexton were laid off from their mining jobs this summer along <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 300 co</span>-workers, they have been camped out here in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, blocking a train car full of coal from going to market.</span> Their protest is against coal company Blackjewel, which halted operations in July without settling its final salary obligations to Rowe, Sexton and an <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 1,800 other</span> workers across the country. But it’s also become a declaration against corporate bankruptcy laws that they say deprioritize workers’ interests.
“The same situation may have happened to others, but we are the ones making a stand,” said Rowe,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35,</span> who was laid off days after he purchased his first house. “We mined the coal and broke our backs to get that coal, so that coal belongs to us until they pay for it.”
Blackjewel is part of the latest spate of coal producers to file for bankruptcy, a trend that has lingered under President Trump as the nation’s appetite for coal has continued to shrink. The Trump administration’s rollback of environmental regulations implemented under Obama have failed to spark a revival in communities like Cumberland that formed his political base during <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 election</span>.
Cumberland is located in Harlan County, where Trump <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 85 percent</span> of the vote. But these miners say their fight isn’t a political one. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">At the camp, there is an informal policy against speaking about Trump or partisan issues, underscoring the president’s continued popularity in areas where the local economy has continued to suffer.
</span>“That is the main reason we have gotten as far as we’ve got now; it’s because we have kept the nonsense down,” Rowe said, referring to the nation’s divisive political debate.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Although the number of Americans employed in the coal industry nationwide has remained relatively steady since Trump took office, analysts say the industry faces a rocky future as energy suppliers continue to shift toward renewable sources and relatively low-cost natural gas.</span> Annual U.S. coal production is expected to drop <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 711 million</span> tons to less <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 million</span> tons during the next five years, said Gregory Marmon, a principal coal analyst at global consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The administration has definitely pulled back regulations, and that has stopped some of the bleeding, but renewable energy is so cost-effective, and natural gas prices are so low, the pulling back of some regulations has not been able to stop the decline of coal,” Marmon said.

Blackjewel, which operated mines in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, abruptly announced <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 1 that</span> it was shutting down operations. Paychecks bounced or were clawed out of miners’ accounts. Other paychecks were never issued.
“We had just bought a washer, and then the bank pulled the money back out, and it made our account negative,” said Stacy Rowe, Chris Rowe’s wife.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The effect of those missed paychecks has rippled through the county’s economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Many of the miners <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">made $20 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $30 an</span> hour, a middle-class salary in a county where the household median income <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $24,000 a</span> year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Upset that the product of his labor was about to leave town while his bank account showed a negative balance <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2,100,</span> Sexton phoned Rowe and other miners to stop the coal train on <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 29,</span> an act of defiance that continues today.
</span>After a tense standoff with Kentucky State Police troopers, the rail cars remained stationary and the miners were permitted to continue their protest. The workers have erected blue and white tarps along the rail tracks to create a makeshift kitchen, children’s playroom, and a space to collect donated clothes and canned goods. Portable toilets have been trucked in. Each night, miners pitch tents or sleep in their trucks to avoid the coyotes and black bears that pass these rail tracks parallel to a tributary of the Cumberland River named “Poor Fork.”
“If that train leaves, we ain’t got nothing,” said Sexton,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> who said Blackjewel owes him <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $5,000.</span> “This is all we got left, because we mined it and still ain’t got paid for it.”
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Labor Department has sought an injunction to prevent Blackjewel from moving the rail car, which is estimated to have <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1 million</span> in coal, according to local media reports.
</span>Meanwhile, a team of attorneys is working to help the miners, who were not unionized, to secure back pay and other damages as part of bankruptcy proceedings. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Sam Petsonk, a West Virginia attorney who is <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">representing 1,100 of</span> the laid-off employees, said the miners’ plight highlights the need to reform bankruptcy laws so employee wages and benefits are more highly prioritized in such legal proceedings.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Blackjewel is selling off mines as part of the bankruptcy proceedings and, in at least one case, “the buyer has committed to assume and pay outstanding employee obligations,” according to a statement from interim CEO David Beckman.
</span>The previous chief executive, Jeffrey Hoops Sr., resigned on <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 3.</span>
“Blackjewel knows that each day that passes creates additional hardship for miners who have not yet been brought back to work and their families,” Beckman said. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The company “continues to work tirelessly on finding ways to make all of the employees whole on their pre-petition wages.”
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The protest has brought attention to the decline of labor unions across coal country, particularly in Harlan County, site of a violent uprising in the 1930s by coal miners who attempted to form a union.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">As mines shut down in recent decades, amid declining reserves and more stringent environmental regulations, they have been replaced with smaller, less labor-intensive operations that relied on nonunionized workers.
</span>Now, there are no unionized coal mines in Kentucky, according to Phil Smith, the director of communications and government affairs for the United Mine Workers of America. Nationwide, just about a quarter of the nation’<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 38,000 hourly</span> coal miners are represented by the United Mine Workers, Smith added.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">“These workers are showing how all workers are vulnerable to the efforts of corporations to deny them wages and benefits, but you can come together as a group and challenge it,” said William J. Londrigan, president of the Kentucky AFL-CIO.
</span>[Rural Appalachia lags the rest of the country in infant mortality and life expectancy]
The fight has attracted national attention. Farmer Wayne Cryts <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drove 12 hours</span> from Missouri to show support for the coal workers’ cause.
While visiting the camp last week, he told Sexton and Rowe that he made national headlines in the early 1980s when he nearly <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 31,000 bushels</span> of soybeans after the company that stored it declared bankruptcy. With his crop tied up in court proceedings, Cryts and dozens of supporters tried to force their way into the grain elevator to retrieve his harvest. The move triggered a protracted legal battle that eventually landed Cryts in prison.
“I can tell you from experience, that coal is the only leverage you got,” said Cryts, who vowed to return if authorities try to forcibly break up the camp.
Meanwhile, all around them, storefronts are boarded up and signs advertising payday loans are affixed to power poles. Some Cumberland residents say their faith in the U.S. political system is being tested.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“It just feels like we are still waiting” for Trump’s vow to revive the economies of depressed communities, said Boe Montgomery,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59.</span></span> “This town is just about done in, and they might as well just make it a lake.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">But Dan Mosley, the county executive, said the overall health of Harlan County’s economy had been on an upswing in recent years before the Blackjewel bankruptcy.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The county had <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 13 percent</span> unemployment rate in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2017,</span> when Trump was sworn into office, but it had fallen to <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate surged back <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 13 percent</span> in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
</span>The closure of the Blackjewel mines shouldn’t be viewed as “an issue that affects the president in any way,” Mosley said.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“This is an issue of one failed company, and one failed executive who didn’t manage his company the right way,” said Mosley, a Democrat, who added the region also needs to continue diversifying its economy.
</span>As he sat in the protest camp last week, holding his 9-month-old daughter, 29-year-old David Pratt said being laid off made him decide to go to college to get his nursing degree.
“I just started last Monday and decided to do it while I’m still young enough,” said Pratt, noting he’s now been laid off three times from three different coal companies over the <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 11 years</span>.
But many of the miners say they remain optimistic they will soon be able to return to work after Blackjewel’s Kentucky assets are sold off to a new owner.
If that happens, though, the miners believe their protest will have sent a powerful message to their new boss as well.
“Coal will make a comeback, maybe not a big comeback, but it will come back,” Rowe said. “And hopefully these companies will see guys are going to start standing up again.”"

The Affordable Care Act will lose its teeth <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span></span> as the penalty for not buying insurance disappears – leaving the health care law’s future as murky as ever.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On one hand, recently released enrollment numbers indicate the system may be able to survive the elimination of the so-called individual mandate penalty – which was stripped as part of last year’s tax overhaul.
</span>While the requirement to buy insurance was considered a crucial part of the original law, enrollment dipped but did not dive in anticipation of that penalty disappearing. The official numbers show enrollment in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 39 states</span> that use the federal exchange declined <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 4.2 percent</span> from last year – from <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 8.8 million</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5 million</span>.

“The funny aspect to the individual mandate is that it mostly was [threatening] to penalize people who were already going to buy insurance anyway,” said Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow and health scholar at George Mason University’s libertarian-oriented Mercatus Center.
In other words, Graboyes said, the vast majority of people who signed up on the government-run portal did not need the threat of a penalty.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, many people who did not find ObamaCare to be a good deal skipped it and either paid the price or made an excuse.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Figures from the Internal Revenue Service show <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 4.1 million</span> taxpayers <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 paid</span> the penalty for not having insurance <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The federal government <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collected $2.9 billion</span> in revenue from those taxpayers.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Another 10.8 million</span> taxpayers claimed one of many hardship exemptions.
Yet experts said the elimination of the penalty is just one of many factors driving an enrollment decline.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The big question going <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 2019 and</span> beyond will be whether that slide will continue, and whether the system will continue to take on sicker customers while losing the young and healthy – creating an imbalance that would threaten higher prices.</span> Add to the mix a recent court ruling against the law, and ObamaCare continues to take hits despite Republicans’ repeated failure to repeal it.
Edmund Haislmaier, a health policy expert at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said many people who were young and healthy have concluded that insurance simply was not worth it. This is especially true if they had no assets that would be at risk if an emergency caused them to be treated without insurance at a hospital.
“What [the architects of the law] didn’t account for was the behavior of the target population,” he said.
For now, Republican congressional efforts to further dismantle the law – beyond their mauling of the mandate – are dead in the water for at least the next two years, with Democrats taking back the House.
But ObamaCare now faces a new legal threat, following a federal court ruling this month declaring the health care law unconstitutional – and creating a new element of uncertainty.
OBAMACARE COULD RETURN TO SUPREME COURT
That legal dispute is tied to the mandate penalty’s elimination.
Back <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> the Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare’s individual mandate, ruling that the government could require the purchase of health insurance under its taxing power. But in his recent opinion, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that because the mandate penalty was eliminated, the rest of the law is invalid.
“The remainder of the ACA is non-severable from the individual mandate, meaning that the Act must be invalidated in whole,” O’Connor wrote.
The Affordable Care Act remains in place pending appeal as the law’s defenders vow to preserve it. Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi blasted the ruling as “absurd.” The case eventually could come before the Supreme Court.
Josh Blackman, a South Texas College of Law Houston professor who has written two books on ObamaCare, said the judiciary must look at what the lawmakers who drafted the plan thought of the mandate. And there is plenty in the record indicating that they believed the law could not work without it, he said.
“We have to look at the mandate and the intent of <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Congress</span> to resolve this question,” he said.
The mandate originally was pitched as a way to get healthy people to sign up for subsidized insurance and offset the costs for others, thus keeping the program’s overall costs in check.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Congressional Budget Office long had predicted that without the stick of a penalty, millions of people would ignore the carrot of subsidized health care.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last year, the budget forecasters determined that eliminating the mandate would result <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 13 million</span> fewer people with insurance <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2027 than</span> if it remained in place.</span> That <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included 5 million</span> fewer people on Medicaid – even though the program is free to enrollees.
But Cynthia Cox, director of the program for the study of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said polling conducted by her organization indicates many people were not even aware of the penalty.
“The mandate is only as effective as people know about it. … To me, that just seems like a lack of information,” she said.
The penalty itself has risen from its inception. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">People filing their tax returns in April will have to pay the greater <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.5 percent</span> of household income <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $695 per</span> adult <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $347.50 per</span> child if they did not have health insurance for the entirety <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That is far less than the cost of coverage for many people, though.
</span>And <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">come 2019,</span> the penalty imposed on people without insurance will drop to zero when they file their returns <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span>
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Cox pointed to other explanations for the enrollment decline, including an improving economy that has allowed more people to get insurance from employers and the introduction of short-term, limited-duration health plans that are designed to fill insurance gaps when people are between jobs.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Joshua Peck, co-founder of the advocacy group Get America Covered, disputed that the decline is the result of a stronger economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He noted that the economy has been growing each year the Affordable Care Act has been in place.</span> But he agreed that the new short-term alternatives – what he calls “junk plans” – have played a role.
Peck also blamed the Trump administration for slashing outreach efforts <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 90 percent</span> over the past two years. Although “most people are not motivated by the penalty,” he argued, eliminating the mandate has not helped.
“It did have an impact,” he said. “But it isn’t all by itself the most important factor.”"

Unemployment Claims Rise Sharply, Showing New Economic Pain
Weekly filings for jobless benefits hit the highest level since July as the pandemic’s resurgence batters the service industry.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ten months after the coronavirus crisis decimated the labor market, the resurgent pandemic keeps sending shock waves through the American economy.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Though more than half of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 22 million</span> jobs lost last spring have been regained, a new surge of infections has prompted shutdowns and layoffs that have hit the leisure and hospitality industries especially hard, dealing a setback to the recovery.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The latest evidence came on Thursday when the Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, exceeding one million for the first time since July.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Just days earlier, the government announced that employers had <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shed 140,000 jobs</span> in December, the first net decline in employment since last spring, with restaurants, bars and hotels recording steep losses.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We’re in a deep economic hole, and we’re digging in the wrong direction,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist with the career site Glassdoor.</span> “The report obviously shows that the rise in claims is worse than expected, and there is reason to think that things are going to get worse before they are going to get better.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">That prospect is all the more troubling because a major element of the relief package signed by President Trump last month — <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $300 weekly</span> federal supplement to other unemployment benefits — is set to run out in mid-March.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he will push a new stimulus package through Congress to provide a lifeline for workers and employers until the pandemic can be brought under control.</span> His plan will include direct payments to most households along with aid to small businesses and local and state governments.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The recent economic data has brought a new sense of urgency to such efforts, with millions struggling to make ends meet even as more job losses could be in the offing.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Labor Department said on Thursday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 1.15 million</span> workers filed initial claims for state unemployment benefits during the first full week of the new year.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">A <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 284,000 claims</span> were filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program for freelancers, part-time workers and others normally ineligible for state jobless benefits.</span> Neither figure is seasonally adjusted. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled 965,000.</span>
Before the pandemic, weekly filings typically totaled <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 200,000.</span>
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The holidays may have held down unemployment claims in previous weeks, with people waiting until the new year to submit claims.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But several economists expressed skepticism that filing delays were a major driver of the uptick in claims last week.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“I don’t think there’s any question that on the margin, there could be some unusual things going on,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“But we have to think also about the fact that these are not our grandfather’s unemployment lines — meaning much of this is done digitally.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">I think if one just tries to understand human nature, it doesn’t make a lot of sense that someone would be delaying a request for financial assistance when they’re out of work.”
More likely, economists say, is that <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $300 federal</span> supplement prompted an increase in demand for benefits.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Confusion over the new federal aid — which Mr. Trump spent several days threatening not to sign — may also have temporarily slowed down claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which fell during the week ending Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.</span></span> The increase last week brought the numbers more in line with the previous elevated levels.
Those seeking new work have found diminishing prospects. Hiring slowed for five straight months before December’s outright reversal. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">In November, even before the recent surge in virus cases, the number of workers officially counted as unemployed outnumbered job openings by more than four million, according to the Labor Department.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">And the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group, says the number of workers displaced by the pandemic is far higher than <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10.7 million</span> officially counted as unemployed in December.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">By the institute’s calculation, after adjusting for misclassification and undercounting and factoring in those considered to have quit the labor force,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 26.8 million</span> workers are jobless or have seen a drop in hours and pay because of the pandemic.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Even with the new federal aid for the unemployed in last month’s legislation, there are continuing concerns about the processing of payments — a task left to the states — after problems with the initial round of emergency benefits last spring.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“States are extra cautious now to get as much guidance as possible,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit workers’ rights group.</span> But she said some states, including New York, seemed better equipped to move quickly this time, taking an “ask questions later” approach.
She said she expected that by next week most states would have “a significant piece” of their program up and running, if not all of the components.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">In addition to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $300 weekly</span> supplement and the short-term renewal of benefits for gig workers and the self-employed, the latest round of federal aid renewed Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, a program for those whose state benefits have run out.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">The disparate nature of state unemployment programs, some of which provide as little <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 12 weeks</span> of benefits in normal times, has made them a target for Democrats.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has said he will press for an overhaul of the nation’s unemployment benefits system.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">As part of his economic recovery plan, Mr. Biden will seek congressional approval of an automatic renewal of federal unemployment benefits and other aid until the jobless rate falls to a given level.</span> That would alleviate the need for repeated legislative action in times of crisis.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">In the meantime, as the coronavirus pummels the service sector, employers are likely to cut more jobs in the weeks ahead.</span> Some struggling businesses may not survive.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">“When I look at the situation of the pandemic and the health situation, people are still scared of the virus, as they should be, and that is going to have an economic impact,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at the career site Indeed.</span> “The virus is the root of all that is going on right now.”
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Still, economists and analysts see better times ahead, possibly as soon as the spring.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">As more people are vaccinated, cases will begin to fall, which will ease restrictions on businesses and could lead to a resurgence in consumer activity.</span> Warmer weather could allow more people to gather outside, slowing the spread of the virus, as it did last year. <span id=""30"" class=""red"">A new stimulus package could also alleviate some of the pandemic’s economic pain.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Yet even when the coronavirus does become contained, economists say that an upswing will not happen overnight.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">“As we get into the second quarter, the economy should begin to heal,” Mr. Hamrick of Bankrate said.</span> “But clearly, all of this has taken much longer than anyone expected, and probably the healing will take some time as well.”

Growth rate was the fastest recorded in two years after expanding an <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">anemic 1.4% in</span> the second quarter
WASHINGTON—U.S. economic growth accelerated last quarter, easing fears of a near-term slowdown but doing little to change the trajectory of a long but weak expansion.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services produced across the economy, expanded at an inflation- and seasonally <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adjusted 2.9% annual</span> rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday.</span> That was stronger growth than the second quarter’s pace <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.4%.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected growth at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.5% pace</span> for the July-to-September period.
</span>Last quarter’s growth rate was the fastest recorded in two years.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The third-quarter acceleration largely reflected increased exports and a buildup of inventories, while consumer spending increased at a slower rate.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The latest data “do not point towards a new growth path but rather a strong rebound following one year of soggy growth,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM US.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Friday’s data also gave voters their last comprehensive look at the economy’s health before the November election.
</span>The improvement could give Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton more latitude to position herself as the candidate to continue Obama administration policies that have led to a long expansion. Still, the most recent gain comes in the weakest expansion in recent memory, a point Republican candidate Donald Trump makes frequently.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Since the recession ended in mid-2009 the economy has grown at roughly <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2% annual</span> rate, making the current expansion the weakest on records back <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1949.</span>
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve policy makers are likely to hold the central bank’s benchmark interest rate steady when they meet next week, but improved output gains could support the first increase in a year at their December meeting.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Acceleration in growth in the third quarter, as well as continued improvement in the labor market and indications of higher inflation,” will lead the Fed “to boost the federal funds” in December, PNC Financial Services economists wrote in a note Friday.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The third-quarter GDP report showed consumer-spending gains slowed after a strong advance this spring.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Personal-consumption expenditures rose at <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.1% pace</span> in the third quarter compared with <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.3% gain</span> during the prior period.</span> Spending on long-lasting durable goods such as cars and appliances rose grew at better <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 9% in</span> the past two quarters.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of total output.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Exports, which add to GDP, increased at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 10% rate</span> in the third quarter, the best gain in nearly three years.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Export gains had slumped over the prior year and half, in part because a stronger dollar made U.S. good more expensive overseas.</span> But separate data suggested that shipments of agricultural products, especially soybeans, supported the latest gain.

4255,"<h3>Senate Passes $1.2 Trillion Infrastructure Bill</h3>After months of painstaking haggling, the U.S. Senate voted Tuesday to approve a <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">historic $1.2 trillion</span> bill designed to upgrade the nation’s aging infrastructure system by repairing and constructing new roads, bridges, airports, waterways and more.
If approved by the House, the legislation would provide the largest federal investment in infrastructure in decades. It would also mark a major victory for President Joe Biden, an avid railway fan who pledged to restore bipartisanship upon taking office.
The vote was bipartisan, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 19 Republican</span> senators joining every Democrat in favor.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $175 billion</span> for building and repairing roads, bridges and railroads;<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $39 billion</span> for public transportation <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $65 billion</span> for expanding access to high-speed internet.</span> It includes tens of billions more to improve electric and power grids and make school buses and ferries more environmentally friendly.
The legislation also <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">includes $15 billion</span> aimed at replacing the nation’s lead pipes and service lines, a big part of Biden’s pledge to aid overlooked and marginalized communities.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The financing of the package, which <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">includes $550 billion</span> in new spending, presented the biggest obstacle for the bipartisan group of senators ―<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 Republicans</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 10 Democrats</span> ― who spent months working to draft it.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They ultimately settled on a mix of various revenue sources — including obscure budget maneuvers, fees, and asset sales — without raising taxes to cover the cost of the new spending.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scorekeeper, said that roughly half of the bill would be paid for, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $256 billion</span> added to the deficit over the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 10 years</span>.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That analysis fueled GOP opposition to the measure, especially among self-described deficit hawks.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">But the bill’s authors countered that CBO’s analysis neglected other savings included in the bill, such as <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $200 billion</span> previously allocated to address the COVID-19 pandemic and unspent unemployment insurance funds.</span> The provisions, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) argued, “don’t score under [CBO’s] rules, but they are real dollars.”
The path ahead for the bill is unclear, however.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has vowed not to allow a vote on the bipartisan legislation without the Senate first approving <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3.5 trillion</span> reconciliation bill — a partisan proposal to address the many policies (like child care, paid leave and climate provisions) that Republicans refuse to engage on.
Democrats on Monday unveiled their outline for the bill, a list of instructions for relevant Senate committees tasked with writing its various components. It includes huge liberal priorities such as paid leave, monthly checks for parents, immigration reform and new Medicare benefits.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“A budget should be a statement of our values, and this budget is a clear declaration of the value that congressional Democrats place on America’s workers and families,” Pelosi said in a statement, praising the “transformational” document.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The reconciliation process allows Democrats to avoid a GOP filibuster, but it requires every member of the Democratic caucus to vote for the package, even those who have concerns with <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3.5 trillion</span> price tag like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
</span>House progressives, meanwhile, are flexing their muscles by threatening to vote against the bipartisan infrastructure bill if their Senate counterparts decrease the size of the reconciliation package. A protracted standoff between the party’s two ideological wings could derail both bills and blow up Biden’s legislative agenda, which got a huge boost this week.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The more immediate challenge for Democrats this week, however, is staying united in response to numerous amendments Republicans are expected to offer to the Democratic budget resolution ― amendments that are often messaging bills designed to exploit divisions within the party on taxes, spending, immigration and other issues ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</span> The so-called “vote-a-rama,” a grueling marathon of votes, could last many hours and potentially even days."
91407,"<h3>'Wealth Effect' Drives Vacation-Home Sales</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Stock Rally, Real-Estate Rebound Boost Market for Second Houses

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 11</span>:09 pm ET

Sales of vacation homes are surging again, the result of rising wealth in higher-income households and renewed confidence in the housing market.

</span>The number of second homes acquired for part-time personal use <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 30% last</span> year <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 717,000 homes</span>, according to an annual survey by the National Association of Realtors. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The gain was the largest since the association started tracking second-home sales <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003.</span>

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Although the number of second homes sold last year is well short of the high point of <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1.1 million</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006,</span> last year's jump signals a rapidly changing sentiment about the value of residential real estate, which just a few years ago was considered a poor investment amid the broad market bust.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Economists note that the vacation-home market was a beneficiary of last year's big gains in the stock market and rising home values, bringing buyers more wealth and confidence.</span> The Standard & Poor'<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 500 index</span> of stocks posted <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 30% increase</span> last year, its largest <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1997.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The median price of an existing home rose <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 11.5%,</span> the largest gain <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> according to the Realtors group.

</span>That combination gives rise to the classic ""wealth effect"" in which people feel more wealthy and therefore more willing to spend. More households also sought to diversify their wealth by transferring their gains from stocks and other investments into real estate.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Rising prices and favorable currency-exchange rates spurred Calgary residents Sherry and Phillip Hickey to buy a second home in Mesa, Ariz., last year to escape the Canadian winters.</span> The couple, represented by Realtor Kris Anderson at Your Premier Team at RE/Max Excalibur, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $357,500 on</span> a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home where they intend to spend roughly five months a year.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""We just saw that things were looking better in the Phoenix market and prices were going up,"" Ms. Hickey said.</span> ""We wanted to get in before they went up too high and to make use of the Canadian dollar at par"" with the U.S. dollar at the time.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Ms. Hickey,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56 years</span> old, and her husband,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 63,</span> who own a small business in concrete forming, spent several decades of savings on the purchase.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">""The housing market is in full-blown recovery mode,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.</span> ""People are much more confident in the sector as a long-term investment [as shown by] their decision to purchase an extraordinarily discretionary item, a second home.<span id=""9"" class=""red"">""

Overall, vacation homes accounted <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 13% of</span> U.S. home sales last year, up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 11% in</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> according to the Realtor association survey.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Their median price last year <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $168,700,</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 12.5% from</span><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012.</span>

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Regionally, the South accounted for most vacation home sales last year—41%—likely due to its mild weather.</span> Next was the West, with 28%; the Northeast, with 18%; and the Midwest, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 14%.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Florida tends to propel the South to the forefront of the vacation-home market.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">""The market definitely picked up for vacation homes in the Tampa Bay area overall last year,"" said Tony Baroni, who leads five real-estate agents at Keller Williams Realty in the Tampa Bay, Fla., area.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">""Our market had gone down so much [in price] that, even when it started recovering, buyers still felt like it was a great value.</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">""

The second-home surge also underscores a disparity in the market.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">More-affluent, move-up buyers trading into their second- or third-generation home have carried the U.S. real-estate market in recent years as would-be first-time buyers have been hobbled by strict mortgage-qualification standards.

</span>Also, several measures show that household wealth reached new heights last year. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Pay gains have favored better earners; U.S. Census Bureau data show that the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 60% of</span> U.S. earners saw household income rise <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2.3% or</span> more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 while</span> the <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">bottom 40% saw</span> gains of less <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1.8%.</span>

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Deutsche Bank's Mr. LaVorgna pointed to the U.S. ratio of household liquid assets to liabilities, meaning a comparison of readily sellable assets such as cash and stock against debt such as mortgages.</span> In last year's fourth quarter, household liquid assets <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 2.6 times</span> liabilities, the highest ratio <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2000,</span> he said. The latest ratio well exceeds the long-term average <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.1 times</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980.</span>

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Even so, ""from a macroeconomic perspective, it's a positive thing,"" said David Berson, chief economist for Nationwide Insurance.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">""While the benefits of second homes may accrue disproportionately to the upper half of the income distribution, there are a lot of people who build these homes"" and benefit from ancillary spending tied to them.

</span>Meanwhile, the Realtor association's survey, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 2,008 households</span>, also found that second-home purchases by investors declined last year <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 8.5% to</span> an <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 1.1 million</span>. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Such a drop has been widely forecast as home prices rise and the number of foreclosed and distressed properties declines.</span> The survey doesn't include purchases by large, institutional investors.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Law firms, technology start-ups and other white-collar employers that were initially able to keep workers on payroll and let them work from home are now laying people off as revenue dries up.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Even ZipRecruiter isn’t immune — the company cut hundreds of jobs this week as the steep drop in job postings cut into its business.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“People are being way too sanguine about a lot of the white-collar industries,” said Martha Gimbel, an economist and labor market expert at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“This thing is going to come for us all.”
Erica Battle, an education consultant in Nashville, figured her industry was as close to recession-proof as any — no matter how bad the economy, schools stay open.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But as schools moved to online learning because of the virus, business began to dry up.</span> Then, on <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 16,</span> as she was preparing for a weeklong consulting trip to Alabama and Texas, she got a call: The gigs were canceled.
“It was like, this is unbelievable, this is not really happening,” Ms. Battle said. “I’m going to wake up and I’m going to have to catch a flight.”
April was meant to be one of her busiest months, as schools rush to get students ready for standardized testing season. Instead, she is home with her husband and teenage son, trying to figure out how to cut expenses. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">They have gotten their bank to defer this month’s mortgage payment.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Ms. Battle’s husband, a substance abuse counselor, still has a job, but they aren’t sure how long that will last.
</span>“When you have to think about paying for groceries or for therapy, which one are you going to do?” Ms. Battle said.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Economists have warned that those sorts of choices — groceries or therapy?</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">— could turn an acute economic crisis into a long recession.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">If laid-off workers can’t pay their bills, there could be a cascade of further layoffs and business failures.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The greater the damage, the less chance of a quick economic rebound once the health crisis eases.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“The deeper the layoffs get, the longer the recovery will take,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist for ZipRecruiter.
</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2 trillion</span> emergency outlay by Congress last week was meant, in part, to prevent that cascade. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The government will provide businesses with low-interest loans — which in some cases could turn into grants — to help them avoid layoffs and keep the lights on.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">And the law temporarily expanded the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers and offer them more generous benefits.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But even before that expansion, the unemployment system was strained by the surge in job losses.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">State unemployment offices have reported record levels of calls and online inquiries, and jobless workers have struggled to get through to file claims.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Dustin Sullivan,<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 39,</span> finished his final shift at the check-in desk at the W Hotel in Times Square on <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 19,</span> but he had to wait to apply for jobless benefits until Wednesday of the following week — the day that New York had designated for people whose last names begin with the letters O through Z.
</span>He spent most of the next week struggling to file a claim, first encountering a website crash and then a telephone nightmare: “Calling on the phone and getting a busy signal. Calling and getting an automated message saying no one’s available and hanging up on me. Calling and immediately getting a message in Spanish that I don’t understand. Calling and getting through-ish — to the first part of the session” — the part that takes your information and Social Security number before telling you to hold on to speak to a representative — “and then hangs up on you.”
Finally, on Tuesday, he managed to file his claim.
“So I now join the group who can shout out to the rest: ‘There’s hope!’” Mr. Sullivan wrote in an email.
Mr. Sullivan was one of more <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 366,000 New</span> Yorkers to file claims last week, up <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 80,000 the</span> week before, according to Thursday’s federal data. California, another state that has struggled with the deluge of filings, reported close <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 900,000 claims</span> last week, up <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 186,000.</span> Those figures, unlike the nationwide total, are not adjusted for seasonal patterns.
In a news conference this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said he knew the state’s claims system wasn’t keeping up with the surge, and he said hundreds of people were working to expand capacity.
“The site is so deluged that it keeps crashing because you literally have hundreds of thousands of people at any time trying to get on the site,” he said. “I apologize for the pain. It must be infuriating.”
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Economists, too, have struggled to keep pace with the speed of the collapse.</span> A month ago, most forecasters still thought the United States could avoid a recession. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Today, many economists are expecting a decline in gross domestic product that rivals the worst periods of the Great Depression.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">On Friday, the Labor Department will release its monthly report on hiring and unemployment, usually one of the most-watched indicators on the economic calendar.</span> But the data was collected in early March, an eon ago in the coronavirus age. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Most forecasters expect it to show only a modest uptick in the unemployment rate and a small decline in jobs, despite the wave of layoffs that hit later in the month.
</span>For workers and businesses, the reversal of fortune has been head-spinning.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Barely a month ago, Elizabeth Mora quit her job in Utah to take a new position as a supply chain manager for MGM Resorts in Las Vegas.</span> But by the time she crossed the state line in a moving truck two weeks later, the hospitality industry was beginning to shut down. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">After two days on the job she was furloughed, and the MGM hotel where she was staying temporarily as part of her relocation package had closed.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">“In a moment, I became both jobless and homeless,” she said.
</span>Now Ms. Mora is staying with an acquaintance and living out of the suitcase she filled with two weeks’ worth of clothes when she moved. The rest of her belongings are in a storage facility. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">She is applying for any job she can find and briefly considered selling home-baked bread — until she discovered that the local grocery stores had no more flour.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">When she accepted the job at MGM, Ms. Mora said, she was excited to begin a new phase.</span> Now, she said, she is just trying to survive.
“I picked up my entire life and I moved here, not only physically but emotionally,” she said. “I’ve never felt the sense of uncertainty like I do now.”"
30465,"<h3>U.S. Economy Contracted 0.7% in First Quarter</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The economy got off to an even weaker start this year than first thought, the government reported Friday, as economic activity contracted amid a disappointing trade picture and continued caution on spending by businesses and consumers alike.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 0.7 percent</span> decline in economic output in the first quarter <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015 was</span> a reversal of the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">initial 0.2 percent</span> advance for the period reported last month by the Commerce Department.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">While statistical quirks and one-time factors like wintry weather in some parts of the country played a role, as did a work slowdown at West Coast ports, the lackluster report for January, February and March underscores the American economy’s seeming inability to generate much momentum.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Much of the revision was spurred by fresh data showing businesses added to inventories at a slower pace than first estimated, while net exports fell slightly more than first thought.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A sharp pullback in energy exploration in the wake of falling oil prices is also putting pressure on business investment.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Most experts had expected Friday’s data to show a contraction in the first quarter, and virtually no mainstream economists believe the country is on the verge of a recession.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Still, the weakness is a reason the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise short-term interest rates until the second half <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span></span></span> after speculation that a June increase was possible.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Consumers, who generate roughly two-thirds of growth, have also been less willing to open their wallets, despite the windfall provided by lower gasoline prices.</span> Personal consumption rose <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.8 percent</span> last quarter, down <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 4.4 percent</span> in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2014.</span>
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">After the economy grew at an annual rate of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 5 percent</span> in the spring and summer <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014,</span></span> some experts concluded that the economy had found its footing and predicted that a healthier, sustained growth rate of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 3 percent</span> was finally at hand.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The new data for the first quarter, and signs of only a tepid rebound in the current, second quarter <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span></span></span> are now forcing some economists to rethink earlier assumptions.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“This isn’t the off-to-the-races kind of expansion we envisioned six months ago,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">“More and more folks are coming around to the view that the long-term growth rate of the American economy <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 2 percent</span>, at best.</span> We can’t <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sustain 3 or</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 percent</span> growth for very long, so it’s two steps forward, one step back.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">While cloudy, the economic outlook is not necessarily dark.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unemployment has been falling steadily, and experts think it could fall to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 percent</span> by the end of the year, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.4 percent</span> now.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The jobless rate stood <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8 percent</span> a little over two years ago.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The real estate market has also been robust as of late, with a measure of pending home sales last month hitting a nine-year high, according to data released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">New-home sales and construction were also strong in April.
</span>Indeed, an upward revision in residential construction last quarter actually offset some of the weakness elsewhere.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">And experts say some of the weakness in the first quarter of the year reflects how the numbers are crunched by government statisticians to account for seasonal variations, like the retail slowdown that follows the holiday shopping season or less business activity as temperatures plunge.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">That process, known as seasonal adjustment, may indeed have exaggerated the underlying weakness last quarter, according to an analysis by private economists at firms like Barclays and Macroeconomic Advisers, as well as at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">In first quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014,</span></span> the winter slowdown was even more pronounced, with the economy contracting at an annual rate <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.1 percent</span>.
</span>Whatever role seasonal adjustments did play, Mr. Anderson cautions against dismissing the first quarter weakness as a statistical quirk.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Some economists have been trying to explain away the negative numbers,” he said..</span> “I don’t think it’s so easily dismissed. We will get a modest bounce back this quarter.”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">In particular, he said, the dollar’s surge against foreign currencies like the euro is hurting manufacturers and other exporters, a trend likely to continue even with the resolution of the West Coast port slowdown.
</span>Although he expects the annual rate of growth to rebound to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2 percent</span> this quarter and to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 percent</span> in the second half <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span></span></span> that still leaves his estimate <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.2 percent</span> for the annual growth rate for the year. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Last year, the economy grew at an annual rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.4 percent</span>.
</span>“There’s some truth to the statistical issues and the one-time factors, but we are still left with a real deceleration,” Mr. Anderson said. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Two percent is probably where the economy will gravitate longer term.”</span>"
