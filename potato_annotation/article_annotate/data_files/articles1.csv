54624,"<h3>Goldman Sachs Drops the Velvet Rope for Savers</h3>Wall Street firm is offering savings accounts and certificates of deposit from the website of its banking arm

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 7</span>:56 pm ET

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., GS -0.42%decrease; red down pointing triangle adviser to billionaires and the world’s largest companies, will now accept your couch-cushion money.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The financial firm most synonymous with Wall Street started offering savings accounts and certificates of deposit this month from the website of its banking arm, GS Bank.</span> The firm will accept new customers with as little to save <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1,</span> though they will <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">need $500 to</span> open a certificate of deposit.

The move was set in motion last August, when Goldman signed a deal to buy the online-deposit platform of GE Capital Bank. The transaction’s closing this month started the new era for the nearly 150-year-old firm run by Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Goldman Sachs’s sudden fondness of small accounts is mainly driven by recent bank regulations that look more kindly on retail deposits.</span> The bank also is looking to make more loans. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Its core investment-banking and trading businesses suffered a tough first quarter, reviving some concerns about its strategy.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">With the move, the New York company isn’t offering full-service retail banking.</span> For example, its savings accounts don’t come with checking features, ATMs or Goldman branches to accept cash.

The main selling point, in addition to Goldman’s cachet: high rates. The bank is touting <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.05% yield</span> on savings accounts,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1% on</span> one-year certificates of deposits <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2% on</span> five-year CDs.

Those rates are low historically, but much higher than what most large banks are offering these days. Goldman’s five-year CD provides a yield of between four times <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 times</span> the amount offered by the four largest U.S. banks—J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. The yield on Goldman savings accounts exceeds the ones offered by its peers by a factor of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100.</span>

Still, Goldman is moving into a sector with experienced rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Goldman’s rates are competitive with other nationally available offerings, including those of Discover Financial Services, Ally Financial Inc. and Synchrony Financial, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</span> Like many banks that don’t have to maintain branch networks and the costs they entail, Goldman is able to offer higher yields than the biggest banks do, Mr. McBride said.

GE Capital, a unit of General Electric Co., pitched identical rates on the savings accounts and CDs for its <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $16 billion</span> in deposits. Goldman chose to keep offering the same rates and used a similar look and feel for its website to help ease the transition for those existing depositors. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The firm also inherited a call center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 employees</span> to field requests and questions about the savings products.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The GE deal was part of a broader strategy by Goldman to collect more low-cost deposits it can then lend out to clients across each of its businesses, from investment banking to wealth management.</span> Goldman’s GS Bank held <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $88 billion</span> in deposits as of Dec.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> according to a regulatory filing. Much of that came from well-heeled clients in the firm’s wealth-management division, in which the average account has <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $50 million</span>.

The firm has pushed to increase deposits because of the strategy’s regulatory advantages. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Regulators have urged banks to become less dependent on short-term loans from other financial firms.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Typically, big banks have used these funds to back bets, but the money quickly dried up during <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis, exacerbating the market turmoil at the time.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Deposits from consumers offer a steady and low-cost source of funding.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> GS Bank had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $32.9 billion</span> in deposits. In February, Mr. Blankfein said the firm has looked to build its deposit base as it spots places to put that money to work in profitable loans. “We don’t go out and max out on deposits,” Mr. Blankfein said. “We source good investment or good lending opportunities and then get the funding.”

At its current size, Goldman’s deposit base is much smaller than those at Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo. Those banks each had more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> in deposits at the end of the first quarter. Morgan Stanley, Goldman’s closest rival, also has increased deposits <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $157.6 billion</span> as of March<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 16% from</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2015.</span>

Goldman’s deposit efforts are overseen by Esta Stecher, a Goldman veteran who once helped oversee the firm’s legal team and who has run GS Bank <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011.</span> The firm also is pushing an online-lending project, dubbed “Mosaic” internally, to launch in the third quarter, people familiar with the matter said.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The lending unit, led by former Discover Financial Services executive Harit Talwar, plans to offer unsecured loans to individuals and small businesses, eschewing mortgages, auto loans and student loans, the people said.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The business has hired <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 90 people</span> since Mr. Talwar came to the firm last year, they said.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">While launching consumer businesses could bring new challenges and scrutiny to Goldman, regulators of late prefer consumer-finance activities to those tied to the capital markets, said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.</span> “What these actions are showing you,” he said, “is that the regulatory environment is very tough right now for a traditional investment bank.”

Updated <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 31,</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 8</span>:38 pm ET

Commodity prices tumbled anew, plunging the S&P GSCI Total Return index to its worst monthly loss since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2008 and</span> deepening a yearslong rout that few observers expect to moderate.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The index, which tracks a basket of commodities, fell to its lowest level <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2002 on</span></span> Friday, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.</span> All but one of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 24 index</span> components posted losses for July.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Investors in commodity markets are confronting threats from a slowdown in China, an anemic global economy and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates from the Federal Reserve.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The dollar, which has rallied this summer on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy, is also pressuring prices of raw materials, which are traded in the U.S. currency and become more expensive for buyers in other countries when the buck rallies.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Hopes that China has seen the worst of its economic slowdown were spurned after the country’s stock market dived in July, notching its worst month in six years.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">China is the largest consumer of raw materials, and investors now fear that problems in its equity market will reverberate across the economy in coming months as cash-strapped consumers abort purchases of new cars, homes and other goods.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Europe is battling to stave off another economic downturn.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">A weaker euro hasn’t buoyed exports from the region, and growth and inflation remain stubbornly low.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">This dims any prospect of higher demand for raw materials from the region.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Commodity prices are also under pressure as supply of many raw materials runs ahead of global demand.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Companies that grow soybeans or mine for coal outside the U.S. are opting to keep up production because weaker domestic currencies keep their costs low, while a stronger dollar means they bring homxxe larger profits despite falling prices.

</span>Against this backdrop, many investors are choosing to give commodities the cold shoulder.

“Folks are being very cautious in terms of where they want to apply their capital, we’ve seen that in commodities...it just continues to be an area that people want to avoid,” said Dan Farley, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, who helps <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manage $2.4 trillion</span>. Mr. Farley said he reduced investments in the sector at the end <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">July’s selloff touched every sector, with U.S. crude-oil prices <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">tumbling 21%,</span> their worst drop since <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2008,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $47.12 a</span> barrel.</span> Traders were caught off guard by reports that U.S. oil drilling accelerated in July for the first time since December, raising the potential for greater supplies. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers also opened the door to more oil exports from the Middle East.

</span>Corn and soybeans fell as improved weather conditions raised the prospects for the harvest. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Grain prices were also pressured by the turmoil in China, which sowed concern about export demand.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">These worries pushed copper prices to a six-year low in July, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slashing 9.8% off</span> the metal’s value for the month.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">China <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drives 40% of</span> global copper demand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lean hog prices <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 14.3% in</span> July.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">However, since the S&P GSCI Total Return index tracks the daily performance of the contract as well as daily interest earned on funds committed to the investment, this index component <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.5% for</span> the month.

</span>Gold sank to a five-year low during July amid disappointment that China’s official gold reserves didn’t grow as much as expected over the past six years.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">With commodities so beaten down, there is a greater potential that prices will bounce back than make new lows, said George Zivic, who <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $325 million</span> at Oppenheimer Commodity Strategy Total Return fund.</span> “I think the <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 10% is</span> up not down from here,” Mr. Zivic said.

But others say there are more losses on the horizon. Tim Rudderow, chief investment officer at Newtown, Penn.-based Mount Lucas Management, which <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $1.8 billion</span>, said he has been “overwhelmingly bearish” on commodities, particularly gold.

“Commodities go up on the elevator and down on the escalator... <span id=""19"" class=""red"">I fully assume that over the next six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 months</span>, we will be steadily lower in commodity prices,” he said.

25482,"<h3>GOP strategy elevates clashes over crime, race in midterm battlegrounds</h3>One Republican commercial casts Mandela Barnes as a “different” Democrat, and points out his push to end cash bail. Another shows his face on a wall with his last name sprayed in graffiti-style script and highlights a comment he made about reallocating police funds. A third labels him “dangerously liberal on crime.”
Republicans have said the ads are part of a broader strategy of calling out Democrats on crime, an argument they believe will be potent in the closing stage of this year’s midterm elections. But some allies of Barnes, who would be Wisconsin’s first Black senator, have derided the attacks as racist messages that feed on stereotypes. As he faces a torrent of negative ads, Barnes has launched spots seeking to assure voters he will fight crime and support law enforcement. Yet some Democrats said they fear his response has been ineffective.
The tensions playing out in Wisconsin mark one of the starkest examples of a trend that has swept across the midterm landscape with about six weeks left until Election Day: Republicans are increasingly centering their pitch to voters on crime, casting Democrats as weak and ineffective buffers against violent criminal conduct. As Republicans advance that argument, they are drawing growing accusations from Democrats that they are engaging in a pattern of stoking racial divisions, a charge they reject.
At the same time, Democrats worry the attacks could resonate amid the rise in violent crime that has taken place with their party in power at the federal level and in many cities. Some candidates are scrambling to distance themselves from slogans such as “Defund the police” that were popular among left-wing activists after a reckoning on racial justice and policing two years ago but have complicated the party’s image more broadly since that time, according to strategists across the political spectrum.
Homicide rates in the country’s cities have spiked over the past two years, with officials pointing to pandemic-related changes to the criminal justice system and, in some cases, less stringent policing policies. Now, from the Senate battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to key House races across the Midwest and beyond, Republicans are ramping up attacks highlighting incidents of deadly violence, sometimes in grisly detail, in ads and speeches.
“I have been trying to be quiet about it for a long time because I would hate for the Democrats to figure it out, but I think the cat, it’s out of the bag,” said Curt Anderson, a top strategist for National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott (R-Fla.) “For the last eight or nine months I could just see it [crime] coming as the worst issue for the party in power.” He signaled that Republicans would attempt to hit on the issue more sharply in Georgia, where there is another battleground Senate race.
The rationale for the strategy is apparent in public polling. Republicans have a 22-point advantage on handling crime, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 56 percent</span> of registered voters saying they trust Republicans more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 34 percent</span> say they trust Democrats more on the issue, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Just as Democrats have put many Republicans on defense over abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to reverse Roe v. Wade, the GOP is now seeking to go on offense over crime. After spending much of this election cycle with a clear advantage in the midterms, the GOP appeared to lose some ground over the summer in the battle for Congress, and party strategists hope running on crime will help them regain their footing in the final weeks.
During the first three weeks of September, the Republican candidates and allies aired <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 53,000 commercials</span> on crime, according to AdImpact, which tracks political spots on network TV. That’s up from <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 29,000 crime</span> ads they aired in all of August. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 50 percent</span> of all Republican online ads in battleground states have focused on policing and safety since the start of the month, according to data from Priorities USA, a group focused on electing Democrats.
The Republican messaging often seeks to tie Democratic candidates to calls to defund the police and abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even as most nominees do not subscribe to those views. In other cases, Republicans single out policies promoted more directly by Democratic candidates, including limiting or redirecting police funding and changing the way bail regulations work.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">One ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with the House GOP leadership, asserts that Democratic candidate Liz Mathis, running in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, is “not an ordinary Democrat” and associates her with the defund-the-police movement, saying she once marched with a group that supports the cause and employed a campaign staff member who has backed it.
</span>In an interview, Mathis said she anticipated the attacks that she’s soft on crime even though she has voted repeatedly to increase funding for law enforcement, and prerecorded a rebuttal advertisement that features two local sheriffs vouching for her and rejecting calls to defund the police. The ad went up the day after the attacks began, she said.
In the Senate race in Florida, incumbent Marco Rubio (R) launched ads featuring local law enforcement officers who claim that his opponent, Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), “turned her back on law enforcement.” Before she was elected to Congress, Demings served as chief of the Orlando Police Department.
She retorted with her own ads that highlight her nearly three decades working in the police force. “In the Senate, I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police. That’s just crazy,” Demings says in the spots.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">While the crime attacks are not wholly new, to an extent, the GOP emphasis on the issue marks a reorientation of the party’s predominant midterm message beyond the economy and inflation.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Rising costs remain part of the GOP pitch, but several Republican strategists noted that falling gas prices makes the issue less urgent and pointed to the topic of crime as highly effective, particularly in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
</span>Republicans said they believe they can use the issue to motivate their base and persuade undecided and independent voters to cast ballots for GOP candidates. Some Democrats said they see a more sinister strategy reminiscent of past elections, involving racial stereotypes and playing on voters’ worst instincts.
In Wisconsin on Wednesday, a group of activists and lawmakers called on the GOP to remove its ads targeting Barnes on crime. “We’re out here standing up for the truth demanding that these divisive, racist ads be taken down,” said state Sen. Chris Larson (D), describing them as “a blatant attempt to gin up fear.”
Some of the ads, including from the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, seek to connect Barnes’s authorship of a measure to end cash bail to the driver of a vehicle who killed six at Christmas parade in Waukesha. The man charged in that case had been released on <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1,000 bond</span> before driving an SUV through the crowd. The trial in that case is set to begin in early October.
Barnes rejects the assertion that his plan would have freed the suspect, noting that his initiative would require judges to hold defendants if there is “a substantial risk” that the defendant could “cause serious bodily harm” to people in the community.
Cornell Belcher, who was a pollster for Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and watched some of the ads against Barnes, said they play “in the continuum of the politics of victimization.”
“This is Willie <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Horton 2.0,</span>” Belcher added, referring to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1988 GOP</span> ad intended to paint then-Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as soft on crime. It featured a Black man who was released from a Massachusetts prison on a furlough program and went on to rape a White woman.
When shown a different ad from the NRSC attacking Barnes that features his name scrawled in graffiti, Belcher, who is Black, was uncharacteristically at a loss for words. “The imagery of that ad to me is just as important as the words in that ad,” Belcher said. “They’re attempting to ghettoize him.”
Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the NRSC, rejected that the advertisements play on racial tropes. “Crime destroys all people, regardless of race,” Hartline said in a statement. “And Mandela Barnes has supported a radical, soft-on-crime agenda.”
The crime ads, and other attacks against Barnes, ramped up in the end of August. As they’ve hit the airwaves, the share of voters with an unfavorable impression of Barnes has risen, according to polling from Marquette Law School.
Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, said the ads against Barnes have come “fast and furious” and have probably contributed to the worsening of his numbers.
In a statement, Barnes spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel said Sen. Ron Johnson, the GOP incumbent, and his allies “have resorted to lying” about Barnes’s record. She characterized the Republican ads as “desperate attacks and outright lies.”
Barnes has tried to counter some of the GOP ads more directly with his own commercials. He recently released one that features a retired law enforcement officer vouching for him. In another, Barnes stands in a kitchen unloading groceries and says Republicans are lying when they say he wants to “Defund the Police” and “Abolish ICE.”
Barnes was once photographed posing with a red T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase “Abolish ICE” and subsequently distanced himself from the slogan. In the past he has suggested using money from what he called “over-bloated budgets in police departments” to pay for neighborhood services, though his campaign maintains he does not support defunding the police.
Still, some Democrats with ties to the state said privately that Barnes should have been more prepared for the attacks and criticized him for repeating the words “defund the police” and “abolish ICE.” One Wisconsin Democratic operative who spoke on the condition of anonymity to more candidly discuss the race called the latter a “baffling choice.”
In Pennsylvania, Republicans have also turned their focus to crime in the Senate race — portraying Democratic nominee John Fetterman as “dangerously liberal on crime.” Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz has called on Fetterman to fire two brothers working on his campaign who were convicted of murder and later released.
“There’s a racial component here. It’s even less than dog whistling, it’s a horn,” said Joe Calvello, a spokesman for the Fetterman campaign, responding to the attacks Fetterman has faced.
The brothers, Dennis and Lee Horton, are Black. Fetterman invited the brothers to stand with him at a rally in Northwest Philadelphia on Saturday. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Fetterman said he knew his advocacy for them would be used to attack him in future elections but that “I would never trade a title for my conscience.”
</span>The choice in this election, Fetterman told supporters Saturday, is someone who will “fight to make sure innocent men will die in prison versus a man who will fight to make sure they can get back with their families.”
Fetterman has also aired an ad in which he says Oz “would not last two hours” in the town of Braddock, Pa., where Fetterman oversaw a drop in murders as mayor. In the spot, Fetterman shows how he tattooed the dates of homicides on his forearm to keep himself focused on the issue.
Republicans have defended Oz’s strategy and argued that it is helping him gain traction after he struggled over the summer. “People are increasingly concerned about their families’ safety,” said Charlie Gerow, a longtime Republican strategist who was a GOP candidate for governor this year. “I think the message has to be pretty straightforward: Support law enforcement that fully funds police and a system that enforces the law, while Democrats have more empathy for perpetrators than victims.”
Democrats have long seen crime as a political vulnerability and have sought to protect themselves against attacks. In his State of the Union address, President Biden stressed his support for police. Biden has also touted money from the American Rescue Plan he signed that can fund police departments. And the president has touted a gun-control law as evidence of the party’s commitment to fighting violent crime.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) proposed law enforcement pay increases of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 20 percent</span>, and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) sent tens of millions in new funding for various police efforts.
Former president Donald Trump has leaned heavily into the issue of crime, calling for drug dealers to face the death penalty and describing violent offenses in vivid detail. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Right here in Ohio, our once-great cities are now scenes of horror riddled with bullet holes and soaked in blood,” Trump said at a recent rally in Youngstown, Ohio.
Republicans, including Trump, are also increasingly seeking to connect crime with their immigration message, making the argument that lax security at the southern border is a threat to national security and also fuels the illicit drug trade.</span> “It is a natural fit and is out there quite a bit and will happen more,” said Anderson, the GOP strategist.
Itkowitz reported from Philadelphia. Hannah Knowles in Youngstown, Ohio, and Emily Guskin in Washington contributed to this report.

9308,"<h3>Running second makes Cruz everyone’s target at GOP debate</h3>Before Thursday night’s sixth presidential debate, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) had ascended to the most dangerous position in the GOP presidential race: second place. And during the contentious and sometimes surreal debate, Cruz faced attacks both from below – when rival Sen. Marco Rubio called him a flip-flopper – and from above, when billionaire front-runner Donald Trump questioned his eligibility to run for president at all.
The result was a night in which Cruz, a former college debate champion, found himself repeatedly on the defensive. Trump managed to turn around Cruz’s attack on “New York values,” giving an eloquent – especially for Trump – tribute to New York City’s recovery from the terrorist attacks of Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span></span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2001.</span> All Cruz could do was applaud. And in the debate’s late going, Cruz reacted to Rubio’s list of apparent position changes by saying that half of it wasn’t true. The implication, which Cruz surely didn’t intend, was that the other half was.
The bright side, for Cruz, was that he must be doing something right to be the center of attention, just a few weeks before the first Republicans start voting.
“I’m glad we’re focusing on the important topics of the evening,” he said sarcastically, after being asked whether he qualified as a natural-born citizen, since he was born in to an American mother.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The downside was that so much of the debate, broadcast on Fox Business Network, focused on criticisms of him.</span> That meant less scrutiny on Trump, who is still leading Cruz in most places and has pared back Cruz’s lead in Iowa.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Rubio went after Cruz at the end of the second hour of the debate, saying that Cruz had changed his positions on immigration, trade and the military to follow shifting political winds.
</span>“I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance, because they told you it would help you in Iowa,” Rubio said. “That is not consistent conservatism,” he added, using Cruz’s own slogan against him.
Cruz responded: “I appreciate you dumping your oppo [opposition] research on the debate stage,” he said, as the crowd in North Charleston, S.C., booed. “At least half the things Marco said were false.”
“You think they like each other?” Trump quipped, appearing amused as the two rivals sought to kneecap each other.”
[Still don’t think Donald Trump can win? This chart should convince you.]
The exchange came at the end of tough night for both Cruz and Rubio, first-term senators who once worked as allies but now are in each other’s way. Besides the battle between them, Cruz took criticism from Trump, and Rubio was attacked by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, his rivals in the “establishment” lane of this race.
Earlier in the evening, Christie had lived up to his pugilistic reputation, threatening to kick President Obama’s “rear” at one point, and rebuking Rubio for dodging a question with a blunt “You blew it.”
“I’d like to interrupt. I’d like to interrupt. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">I’d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate,” Christie quipped, as Rubio and Cruz argued at length over the intricacies of their respective corporate tax proposals.</span> He said they were trying to dodge a harder question on “entitlement” programs like Medicare and Social Security. “Do you remember that everybody? This is a question on entitlements.”
[Christie hits back: Rubio can’t ‘slime his way to the White House’]
Rubio, who had tangled with Christie earlier in the evening, tried to interrupt. Christie dismissed him: “Nah. You’ve already your chance, Marco. You blew it.”
Christie also criticized Obama for allowing states to legalize marijuana, and for undermining American’s respect for police officers – an apparent reference to Obama’s reaction to the protests over shootings by police. Obama and his allies, Christie said, “give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal. Not to the police officer.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Earlier, Bush was strongly critical of Trump, calling his rival “unhinged” for his policies on immigration and misguided in his plans for high tariffs on Chinese imports.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“This would be devastating for our economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">We need somebody with a steady hand being president of the United States,” Bush said, after Trump said he would threaten large new tariffs on Chinese goods unless China took actions to make its trade with the U.S. more fair.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Bush said it would lead to retaliatory actions by China, which would hurt U.S. exports there.
</span>Trump responded with an attack on Bush’s personality.
“We don’t need a weak person being president of the United States,” Trump said, returning to an old insult that Bush is “low-energy.” “We don’t need that. We don’t need that.”
The crowd in North Charleston, S.C., booed at that, too – one of several times when they seemed to turn against the front-runner.
Questioning Trump’s proposal to bar Muslim foreigners from entering the United States, Bush said that it would alienate vital Muslim allies in the fight against the Islamic State.
“All Muslims? Seriously?” Bush said, in one of his strongest moments during six not-very-strong debates. “They are unhinged,” he said of Trump’s comments on the subject.
A moderator pointed out that Trump’s support had risen in South Carolina by eight points since then.
“Eleven points to be exact,” Trump interjected. He responded with a general statement of concern about Islamic terrorism: “There’s something going on, and it’s bad. We have to get to the bottom of it.”
The exchange came after Trump had rebuked Cruz for talking negatively about “New York values,” offering a tribute to the city’s response to the Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span></span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,” Trump said.</span> He continued: “The people in new York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death. Nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell in the air.
That followed an attack by Cruz in which he said that “New York values” were socially liberal, and tied to money and the media. He said that Trump was representative of those values, and therefore not aligned with the values of early-voting states such as South Carolina, where the debate was held.
“I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made,” Trump said.
It was the second time in this debate that Cruz and Trump – who had once had an unofficial alliance, but now are rivals – had tangled, with Trump having the last word. Earlier in the debate, the two had argued about whether Cruz was even eligible to run for president, since he was born in Canada to an American mother. That led to a long exchange that allowed Trump to restate the point again and again.
[The conservative media’s civil war over Ted Cruz ‘birtherism’]
In the shadow of those two, a pair of lower-polling rivals — Christie and Rubio – each tried to cast the other as too liberal and too friendly to Obama’s priorities. Christie, in particular, responded with some unusually tough words for Obama himself.
“This guy is a petulant child,” Christie said, when asked about Obama’s efforts to circumvent Congress with executive actions to expand background checks on gun purchases. Christie then said he hoped that Obama was watching: “We are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall!”
Unless Christie knows something everybody else doesn’t, Obama is not running in the election this fall. He is scheduled to leave office in January, when a new president takes office.
During the exchange about Cruz’s citizenship, Trump told Cruz that “there’s a big question mark on your head, and you can’t do that to the party.”
“Who the hell knows if you can run for office?” Trump added.
The exchange took several minutes, and also demonstrated the danger – even for a skillful debater like Cruz – of tangling with Trump, a trained master of reality TV. It began with a question for Cruz, who was born in Canada to an American mother, about whether he fit the Constitution’s definition of a “natural born” American citizen, and was eligible to run for president. He said that Trump had dismissed the idea earlier in the race but now was suddenly concerned.
“The Constitution hasn’t changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling,” Cruz said.
That set off a long exchange in which Trump admitted he had, indeed, become more concerned because of Cruz’s rise in the polls. “Because now he’s doing a little bit better. You know, I didn’t care before,” Trump said, although he also reminded Cruz that he was still ahead in the polls. “He’s got probably <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4 or</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 percent</span> chance” of winning the race. Trump imagined a scenario in which Trump himself might choose Cruz as a running mate, “And the Democrats sue because we can’t take him along for the ride. I don’t like that.”
“I’m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump,” Cruz, a Harvard Law graduate and former Supreme Court clerk, responded. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Cruz said that maybe he would make Trump a vice president, which means he could benefit if Cruz was disqualified: “You can get the top job at the end of the day.”
</span>Eventually, Rubio butted in. “I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.”
Earlier in the debate, Trump had called Syrian refugees a “Trojan horse” that brought terrorist sympathizers into the U.S.
“It’s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia. Bombings all over. You look at California. You look, frankly, at Paris,” Trump said when asked about a refugee that President Obama had invited as his guest to the State of the Union. Trump said that refugee’s sympathetic story was not typical: “That’s not representative of what you have in that line of migration. That could be the great Trojan horse.”
Trump has said that he wants a temporary ban on all Muslim foreigners seeking to enter the U.S., and a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants along the border with Mexico. He did not appear to have changed that tactic: “We can’t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can’t do it.”
At one point in the debate, Cruz was asked about a New York Times report that he had failed to disclose loans made to him by Citibank and Goldman Sachs with election officials, while he ran for the Senate from Texas <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> Cruz later disclosed the information with Senate authorities. He rejected it as a “hit piece.”
“Yes, I made a paperwork error, disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that’s the best that the New York Times has got, they’d better go back to the well,” Cruz said.
Cruz began the night by criticizing Obama for failing to mention <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 U</span>.S. sailors who were seized – and later released – by Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, calling it evidence of Obama’s weakness.
“We were horrified to see the sight <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 American</span> sailors on their knees with their hands on their head. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In that state of the union, President Obama didn’t so much as mention <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">those 10 sailors</span>,” Cruz said, ignoring – for the moment – the fact that he had actually been asked about jobs.</span> “It was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander in chief is standing on this stage.”
The sailors were later released by Iran, and the Pentagon said Thursday that they had entered Iranian territorial waters by mistake after a navigational error. But Cruz said that the sailors’ treatment – including the release of footage that showed them with hands on their heads as they were taken into custody – would have drawn a sharper response from a President Cruz.
“Any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America,” Cruz said.
Later, Christie criticized Obama for underplaying the threats to the U.S.: “I watched storytime with Barack Obama.”
The main debate, which began <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9 p</span>.m., was preceded by an “undercard” debate among former tech executive Carly Fiorina, former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.
In the earlier debate, the trio of long-shot candidates offered gloomy visions of the country’s path, all hoping that they might get a ticket to the top tier of the race with just a few weeks remaining until the first votes.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Fox Business Network hosted both debates.
</span>Cruz, in the past, had seemed reluctant to attack Trump — perhaps hoping that he would inherit Trump’s anti-establishment coalition if Trump himself faded. Now, the Texas Republican seems to have given up on that — or perhaps he is trying to hasten Trump’s fade a bit faster.
In recent days, for example, Cruz took direct aim at Trump on several fronts: tying the billionaire to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, questioning his ability to win a general election and casting doubt on his ability to serve as commander in chief.
Cruz also took aim at Trump’s competence. “Does a potential commander in chief know what the nuclear triad is, much less is he or she prepared and able to strengthen it and keep this country safe?” Cruz asked on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.”
In a Republican debate last month, Trump was asked about the nuclear triad — the submarines, bombers and land-based missiles that could deliver the nation’s nuclear weapons — and had trouble with the explanation.
During a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla., on Wednesday night, Trump bragged that rivals who have attacked him in the past have seen their poll numbers tank, sometimes to the point of being pushed out of the race.
“Now, we have another debate tomorrow. They’ll all be attacking me — like, you know, they attack. Whatever. Right? Whatever. What-ever,” Trump said, pursing his lips and shaking his head, as some in the crowd started chanting: “We want Trump! We want Trump!”
“They attack,” Trump said, “but they don’t understand that unlike this country, I attack back.”
Thursday’s main-event debate was the smallest of this crowded campaign so far: just seven candidates onstage, down from the high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 11 during</span> a debate in September.
Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the libertarian-leaning candidate who battled with Rubio and Christie over their hawkish foreign policies, is sitting this one out. Paul’s polling numbers were so low he was relegated to the undercard debate. He then refused to show up at all, saying he was not running an undercard kind of campaign. He also has asked Fox to reconsider and put him on the main stage.
Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich did not figure in the more contentious exchanges, he sought to appeal directly to frustrated middle- and working-class families.
“People are upset,” he said. “You’<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">re 50 or</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 51 years</span> old and some kid walks in and tells you you’re out of work and you don’t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have an answer for that? We do.”
[Who’s got the best ground game in New Hampshire? We may never know.]
Then there was Bush: once this race’s front-runner, now one of its longer shots.
Once again, he was hoping for a debate performance that will reset the race. That has not gone well in the past: In a previous debate where Bush badly wanted a breakout, he picked a fight over Rubio’s voting and attendance record in the Senate and provoked a damaging verbal takedown.
As the leading candidates feuded Thursday, Bush interjected to call for a cease-fire.
“Everybody on this stage is better than [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clinton,” he said. “I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it’s going to be . . . to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.”
[Bush and his super PAC are on the attack – but aiming at different targets]
Ben Carson, the mild-mannered neurosurgeon, seconded Bush’s call. “We have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.”
Carson’s oddball campaign — which included days-long debates about whether, as a young man, he really stabbed a friend in the stomach or menaced his mother with a hammer — now seems to be fading.

Dow Jones & Co. and News Corp. were on the brink of agreeing late yesterday on editorial protections for Dow Jones, an accord that would pave the way for the sale of the publisher of The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate for <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $5 billion</span>, according to people familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">While a deal appeared possible as early as today, the biggest concern on both sides was whether the Bancroft family, which has controlled Dow Jones since early in the 20th century, would support the compromise.</span> Though the family has overcome some of its previous doubts about selling the company, the situation remains fluid, and some members continue to privately express resistance to a deal.

Word of the News Corp. bid first surfaced two months ago, and was initially met with silence from the family. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But Mr. Murdoch was patient, and family members began to worry about the future of Dow Jones if it remained independent in a troubled newspaper industry.</span> After about four weeks of discussions, the family decided to open the company to offers, including News Corp.'s. Soon several members were meeting face-to-face with Mr. Murdoch and talks began among family members about a structure for editorial independence. No serious competing bids emerged, but these talks dragged on.

Last week, the Bancrofts ceded the negotiations over editorial protections to the company's board, which largely supports the sale. But the family's control of most of the super-voting shares in the company gives it ultimate veto power, and the family has been ambivalent from the start.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Michael B. Elefante, the Bancrofts' lead trustee and a Dow Jones director, will be responsible for taking the temperature of the family on an agreement, said people familiar with the matter.</span> As of early yesterday evening, Mr. Elefante had yet to canvass the family on the editorial-independence provisions, and it wasn't clear when he would begin doing so. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A number of family members have expressed reservations about whether Mr. Murdoch can be trusted to preserve Dow Jones's editorial integrity, and some on its board have favored using that concern as leverage to win a higher price, say people close to the negotiations.

</span>While the two sides appeared near a deal, the wild card of the Bancroft family's reaction left the possibility open that any agreement could take an unexpected turn. The proposals on editorial independence have changed significantly since the family's original proposal, which preserved a large role for the family.

Another remaining issue was whether News Corp. would increase the value of its $60-a-share offer. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While no third-party bids for Dow Jones have emerged to put price pressure on News Corp., the board hopes to extract a few more dollars to reassure family members who have been reluctant to approve a sale to News Corp. and its chairman, Mr. Murdoch, the press baron and media mogul who long has coveted The Wall Street Journal.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But both sides indicated that they didn't see last-minute jockeying on price as a major impediment to completing a deal.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The negotiations of recent days had become chaotic and occasionally testy, with the family, News Corp. and Dow Jones directors and executives all jockeying for positions of leverage.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But yesterday afternoon, Joseph A. Stern, Dow Jones's general counsel, brought to News Corp.'s headquarters a marked-up copy of the editorial principles that News Corp. had delivered to Dow Jones on Sunday.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The decision to send the document to News Corp. came after a roughly two-hour meeting Monday afternoon of the special Dow Jones board committee charged with negotiating a possible deal.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In that session, the group -- composed of M. Peter McPherson, the board chairman; Dow Jones Chief Executive Richard Zannino; Harvey Golub, chairman of Campbell Soup Co.; Lewis Campbell, CEO of Textron Inc.; and Mr. Elefante -- went over the proposal in detail and agreed to choose a few issues it would take back to News Corp.</span> The group met again by phone last night.

Neither side appeared to see the issues as big stumbling blocks, according to people on both sides of the negotiations. Yesterday afternoon, the two sides agreed on the outlines of a board to oversee issues of editorial independence, according to a person familiar with the matter. News Corp. had suggested a 16-member board to oversee editorial independence and other issues, which would have five independent members <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 11 appointed</span> by News Corp. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Dow Jones had countered by requesting an entity solely focused on the editorial independence of Dow Jones.

</span>The two sides settled on a single board, but it wasn't clear how many of its members would be independent or how large the board would be. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Murdoch asked that none of the members have any connection to either News Corp. or to the Bancrofts or Dow Jones.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Dow Jones appeared willing to accept that but wanted the members to choose their successors.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Another issue Dow Jones hoped to address was funding for the special committee.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones proposal indicated that an outside foundation and certain family trusts would provide funding for any eventual legal challenges on behalf of the special committee.</span> News Corp. countered, in its proposal, that the special committee would have adequate funding for ""travel and accommodations"" but didn't address how the entity would be funded. The two sides appeared near an agreement on the issue yesterday evening.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The two sides also were negotiating over Dow Jones's Code of Conduct, which provides employees with guidelines for such issues as investments, political donations and conflicts of interest.</span> News Corp. initially had deleted any mention of the code from its proposal, arguing that News Corp. had its own principles that preserved the integrity and editorial independence of its publications. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But Dow Jones's board pushed to preserve its code and appeared to have been successful, said a person familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Dow Jones stock was <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 2.2%,</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $1.30,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $57.50 at</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 p</span>.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</span> After hours, the shares <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.7%,</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $2.10,</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $59.60.</span>

71076,"<h3>With Yuan Move, China Takes U-Turn</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Devaluation comes as officials worry economy is slumping faster than Beijing anticipated

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 9</span>:02 pm ET

BEIJING—Less than three months before China shocked markets with a surprise devaluation of its currency, a top Chinese exchange-rate official told a closed-door gathering that Beijing had no need for such a dramatic move.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Does a deteriorating economy mean there must be a devaluation of the renminbi?” said Yi Gang, the No.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 official</span> at the People’s Bank of China, using an alternative name for the currency.</span> “Not necessarily.”

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">According to a transcript reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Yi told government officials, academics, businesspeople and investors at the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 22 event</span> in Shanghai that China still had a “very large” trade surplus that should support the currency.

</span>Now, China has done a U-turn.

On Tuesday it pushed the yuan into the largest devaluation in its history, cutting its value against the dollar <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.9%.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The move roiled financial markets and set off worries that other central banks would follow suit.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">At home, it signals that Beijing is growing increasingly worried about its slowdown in economic growth.</span> Abroad, the move risks further chilling relations between Beijing and Washington ahead of President Xi Jinping’s meeting with Barack Obama in the U.S. next month.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The currency move came as officials in China’s Commerce Ministry, which oversees exports, and others expressed concern that the economy is slumping faster than China’s leadership had anticipated, according to Chinese officials and government advisers.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Chinese officials also worried about this summer’s confidence-shaking stock-market rout.</span> Overall, it suggests that China’s leaders are looking for new ways to rev up growth as other methods look increasingly ineffective, raising the possibility of further and more dramatic efforts to come.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Tuesday’s move shows Beijing is struggling to balance propping the economy with economic reform.</span> The Chinese leadership is shifting toward stabilizing growth rather than accelerating reforms such as opening the country up for freer cross-border capital flows, according to the Chinese officials and advisers to the government. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Behind the push is Mr. Xi, who they say over the past two months has repeatedly told local officials that “maintaining economic growth” as the government’s top priority for both near term and the next five years.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Xi has more than once brought up stabilizing the economy as ‘the center’ of everything,” said one of the officials who is based in eastern China’s Zhejiang province.</span> “Reform will still be carried out, but it’s taking a backseat to stability.”

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">At the same time, China’s central bank moved in a way that could bolster its efforts to loosen its controls over the currency—a step toward reform.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">While it didn’t tell the International Monetary Fund or other outside groups about its plans, people close to the central bank say, it made the devaluation using a new mechanism that the PBOC believes will make the yuan more closely aligned with market forces.</span> The central bank also took pains to incorporate some previous IMF suggestions in the new mechanism, the people said.

Spokespeople at the PBOC, China’s Commerce Ministry and China’s cabinet, the State Council, didn’t respond to requests to comment.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The move to devalue the yuan comes as China’s leaders are fighting a host of economic ills that could endanger their goal of achieving <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7% annual</span> growth target for this year, which would be the lowest in a quarter century.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">They include weak factory output, slumping demand from both home and abroad, and persistent risks of falling prices that could make it harder for Chinese companies to pay off debt.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The currency step also followed unprecedented government efforts to prop up China’s faltering stock market, which is jeopardizing Beijing’s plan to restructure China’s heavily indebted state-owned companies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">To shore up growth, China has cut interest rates four times and taken other measures to beef up bank lending since November.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Beijing has also freed up local government to issue bonds and the central bank provided financing to commercial banks to purchase those bonds.</span> Since early July, the PBOC has been offering credit to a government agency tasked with propping up falling Chinese shares.

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Increasingly they are also turning to their old playbook of ramping up fiscal spending on infrastructure and other government-backed projects—an approach that spurred growth after <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 global</span> financial crisis but larded the world’s No.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 economy</span> with massive debt.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The central bank also is pumping billions of dollars of funds into China’s policy banks to finance shanty-town renovations and other big-ticket projects.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">China’s cabinet, the State Council, made the decision to devalue the yuan in recent days amid gathering gloom over China’s export sector, according to the officials and advisers.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The latest official data shows Chinese exports in July fell a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surprising 8.3% from</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Exports for the first seven months of the year were <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 0.8% compared</span> with a year earlier.

</span>At home, China moved to make sure the devaluation wasn’t perceived as a desperate by the government. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Ma Jun, chief economist at the central bank, said the devaluation was a “one-off adjustment” and it shouldn’t be seen as the beginning of a weaker currency.</span> Also on Tuesday, the State Internet Information Office issued a directive to state media telling them not to play it up, according to people who received the notice.

Up until now, China’s central bank had been bolstering the yuan’s value by selling large amounts of its dollar holdings to prevent the yuan from sliding against the dollar. It has repeatedly named maintaining the stability of the yuan’s exchange rate as one of its top priorities.

Long-time PBOC Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan for years has push to liberalize the yuan and promote its global use. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">By implementing the devaluation through a market-based mechanism, the PBOC hopes the new system could convince the IMF to get the yuan included in the fund’s elite basket of reserve currencies, which include the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.

</span>The central bank sets the reference rate for the value of the yuan against the U.S. dollar. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">In daily trading, the yuan is allowed to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">move 2% above</span> or below that level, which is also known as midpoint, or fixing.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But the central bank sometimes ignores the daily market moves, at times setting the fixing so that the yuan is stronger against the dollar a day after the market has indicated it should be weaker.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">With Tuesday’s move, the fixing will now be more based on how the yuan closes in the previous trading session, as opposed to being at the complete mercy of the central bank.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It’s a change also called for by the IMF, which is expected to make a decision on whether to declare the yuan a reserve currency late this year.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">“The PBOC hit two birds with one stone,” said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group Ltd, a Sydney-based investment bank.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">“It caused the yuan to weaken, ending support to exports, and it’s making the exchange rate more market-determined, which could help China win the reserve currency status,” Mr. Hu said.

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Still, “the devaluation reflects a change of attitude at the central bank,” said Zhang Ming, a senior economist at the government think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</span> Mr. Zhang has been publicly making a case for devaluing the yuan to help bolster China’s growth since late May. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">“The central bank’s preference for maintaining growth is increasing while its desire to win the IMF reserve-currency status is declining.”

</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">How the yuan trades in the next few days would test how far China would let market forces go in terms of determining the yuan’s value.

</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“If the PBOC was to closely follow the previous day’s closing in setting the daily fixing rate, renminbi depreciation expectations could quickly become entrenched and the yuan could depreciate quite quickly and significantly in the coming days,” said Wang Tao, China economist at UBS AG.

</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">“If so, that would be a sea change in China’s exchange-rate policy as letting the market drive down the yuan can help support growth,” said Ms. Wang, who has cut her forecast for the yuan to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6.5 per</span> dollar by the end of this year, compared <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 6.3 she</span> previously projected.

79412,"<h3>Student tracking, secret scores: How college admissions offices rank prospects before they apply</h3>The admissions officer also received a link to a private profile of the student, listing <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 27 pages</span> she had viewed on the school’s website and how long she spent on each one. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">A map on this page showed her geographical location, and an “affinity index” estimated her level of interest in attending the school.</span> Her score <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 91 out</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100 predicted</span> she was highly likely to accept an admission offer from UW-Stout, the records showed.
Colleges are collecting more data about prospective students than ever before — part of an effort, administrators say, to make better predictions about which students are the most likely to apply, accept an offer and enroll. Records reviewed by The Post show that at <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 44 public</span> and private universities in the United States work with outside consulting companies to collect and analyze data on prospective students, by tracking their Web activity or formulating predictive scores to measure each student’s likelihood of enrolling.
The practices may raise a hidden barrier to a college education for underprivileged students. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">While colleges have used data for many years to decide which regions and high schools to target their recruiting, the latest tools let administrators build rich profiles on individual students and quickly determine whether they have enough family income to help the school meet revenue goals.
</span>The Post identified colleges with data operations by reviewing the customer lists of two top admissions consulting firms: Capture Higher Ed and Ruffalo Noel Levitz. The Post interviewed admissions staffers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 23 colleges</span>, examined contracts and emails obtained <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 26 public</span> universities through open-records laws, and used a Web privacy tool to confirm the presence of Capture Higher Ed’s tracking software on the websites <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 33 universities</span>.
Records and interviews show that colleges are building vast repositories of data on prospective students — scanning test scores, Zip codes, high school transcripts, academic interests, Web browsing histories, ethnic backgrounds and household incomes for clues about which students would make the best candidates for admission. At many schools, this data is used to give students a score <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1 to</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100,</span> which determines how much attention colleges pay them in the recruiting process.
Scoring and tracking are popular at schools that are struggling to survive. Faced with shrinking sources of funding and growing competition for high school graduates, cash-strapped colleges are experimenting with new ways to identify and attract students who can afford to pay tuition, said Lloyd Thacker, a former admissions counselor and founder of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit research group.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“An admission dean is more and more a businessperson charged with bringing in revenue,” Thacker said.</span> “The more fearful they are about survival, the more willing they are to embrace new strategies.”
Admissions consulting companies charge schools tens of thousands of dollars a year to collect and analyze the data of millions of students. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In emails reviewed by The Post, employees of Louisville-based Capture Higher Ed urged school administrators to hand over all data they felt comfortable sharing.
</span>“We love data, so the more the merrier,” one of Capture’s consultants wrote in <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 email</span> to the admissions director at UW-Stout.
Capture Higher Ed spokesman Jim Davidson said the company helps schools provide relevant information to students who have chosen to receive that information. Students can opt out of Web tracking by contacting schools directly, he said.
Doug Mell, a spokesman for UW-Stout, said in an email that the school used Capture’s Web tracking for a one-year trial and did not renew the contract this year. The female student who was tracked last year voluntarily gave the school her background information when she applied, he said. She enrolled in the school last year.
Consultants are expanding their influence on college campuses. Ruffalo Noel Levitz, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has hired the top admissions officers at more than two dozen universities — including Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette — to do paid consulting work on the side, according to interviews and records. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some university officials received compensation from Ruffalo Noel Levitz at the same time that their schools were paying customers of the company — raising questions about potential conflicts of interest, Thacker said.
</span>The vast majority of universities reviewed by The Post do not tell students the schools are collecting their information. In a review of the online privacy policies of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 33 schools</span> using Web tracking software, only three disclosed the purpose of the tracking. The <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">other 30 omitted</span> any explanation or did not explain the full extent or purpose of their tracking.
The State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry said in its online privacy policy that it “does not use cookies.” However, a representative from the school said in an email that the school does use Capture Higher Ed’s tracking cookies to show relevant pop-up ads to students but deletes the cookies from its databases “within four hours.”
Some privacy experts say colleges’ failure to disclose the full extent of how they share data with outside consultants may violate the spirit if not the letter of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, a federal law protecting the privacy of student education records at schools that receive federal education funds. FERPA generally requires that schools ask for students’ permission before sharing their personal data with any outside parties.
Rather than getting permission, some schools have classified the consulting companies as “school officials,” a legal designation that exempts them from FERPA if certain conditions are met.
Zachary Greenberg, a program officer at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a student advocacy group, said colleges that do this risk undermining one of the goals of FERPA — to make the management of records more transparent. “Students deserve to know where their information is going,” Greenberg said.
The Education Department can suspend all federal funding to any school it finds in violation of FERPA but has never imposed that penalty in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 45 years</span> since the law was created. The agency has other enforcement measures and works with offenders to voluntarily come into compliance, said Angela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. She declined to say whether colleges may be violating the law by sharing data with consulting companies.
Many schools do not give students the ability to opt out of data collection. Jacquelyn Malcolm, chief information officer at the State University of New York’s Buffalo State College, said that if prospective students do not want their Web browsing tracked, they should not visit her school’s website.
“You have a choice of not interacting at all,” Malcolm said in an interview, adding that applicants can get information by calling the school, visiting its social media accounts or visiting other websites with information about different colleges.
In an email, a spokesman for SUNY Buffalo State later said that the school is exploring new ways to inform students about its privacy practices and that anyone can request not to be tracked by sending an email directly to Malcolm.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Filtering recruits with socioeconomic data
Data tools appeal to schools that are trying to increase revenue by recruiting students who can afford to pay tuition.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">At Mississippi State University, a state school with more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 18,000 undergraduates</span>, administrators use data to filter a large number of potential applicants down to a select pool of recruits who are a good fit for the school’s academic programs and do not need much financial aid.
</span>Each year, Mississippi State buys data on thousands of high school students from testing firms including the College Board, which owns the SAT, said John Dickerson, assistant vice president for enrollment. These students all gave permission to have their data shared by checking a box when they took the SAT. The nonprofit testing company says on its website that it licenses the names and data of each student <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 47 cents</span> apiece.
Next, Mississippi State shares its list of prospects with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, which uses a formula to assign each one a score. According to Dickerson, the formula for out-of-state students gives the most weight (30 percent) to a student’s desired major; someone choosing agriculture or veterinary sciences, areas where the school is strong, will score higher than a student who wants to major in music. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The formula also weighs their distance from campus (7.9 percent), income level (7.2 percent) and consumer purchasing behavior (6.8 percent), among other factors.
</span>The formula is an example of predictive analytics, a field of computer science that attempts to predict the likelihood of future events by looking for patterns in data. Similar to software that tries to predict what movies or music someone will like, these formulas attempt to guess which students are a good match for a college based on how many attributes they have in common with students who previously enrolled in the school.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">A predictive formula may also be adjusted to favor the types of people a college wants more of, such as ethnic minorities or students of financial means.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mississippi State uses socioeconomic data in its admissions algorithm to recruit more high-income students from outside the state, Dickerson said.</span> Like many public universities, Mississippi State has ramped up out-of-state recruiting because those students pay higher tuition. The university <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drew 42 percent</span> of its freshmen from out of state <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> up <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 26 percent</span> a decade earlier, federal data shows.
“From a practical standpoint,” Dickerson said, “you would want to know if folks have an ability to pay.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The vast majority of Mississippi State students still receive some form of financial aid, and the school says it does not use financial information to determine who gets an offer of admission.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">However, focusing recruiting resources on higher-income students means lower-income students may receive less encouragement to apply for college.
</span>Shaquilla Wordlaw, a junior at Mississippi State, said she thinks it is a good idea for college recruiters to use more data to target messages to the right students. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But Wordlaw, who is from Starkville, where Mississippi State is based, says the school should not discriminate against students based on their income.
</span>“They’re choosing those who are a part of the upper class rather than middle or lower, because they want money,” Wordlaw said. “They’re not focused on the education they are providing.”
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Consulting companies may estimate a student’s financial position by checking their Zip codes against U.S. Census data for estimated household incomes in that area.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Ruffalo Noel Levitz and Capture Higher Ed also buy information from third-party data brokers, which gather consumer data from public and private databases on property holders, magazine subscribers and supermarket loyalty-card members.
</span>Some schools say data analysis can help them find students who might not have applied in the first place. George Mason University, in Northern Virginia, uses data analysis tools to look for nontraditional prospects who might have working-class parents or be the first in their family to go to college, said David Burge, the school’s vice president for enrollment management.
Consulting companies woo college officials
As they pursue student data, colleges have embraced an industry of consultants.
Hundreds of school administrators filled the ballroom of a Nashville convention center in late July for a keynote speech by Sumit Nijhawan, a former tech executive who became CEO of Ruffalo Noel Levitz last year. He paced before a large screen and discussed how data is helping colleges tailor their pitch to individual students, similar to how tech companies such as Spotify and Netflix surface music and videos based on the user, he said. “Usually the solution to problems is lurking somewhere around in data,” Nijhawan told the crowd. “And there’s a lot of data in higher ed — no doubt about that.”
The three-day conference, replete with lunch buffets, PowerPoint presentations and free coffee mugs with company logos, was an example of how consulting companies are trying to win over school officials as they negotiate for larger contracts and more access to student data.
At <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 30 admissions</span> officers have taken part in Ruffalo Noel Levitz’s associate consulting program over the past decade, according to interviews and records posted on the company’s website. Emails reviewed by The Post show the program is helping Ruffalo Noel Levitz build closer ties to campus decision-makers.
Cecilia Castellano, vice provost of strategic enrollment planning at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, became an associate consultant for Ruffalo Noel Levitz around the same time her school signed a three-year,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $48,000 contract</span>, which was obtained by The Post through a public-records request. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Castellano, who was listed as the “primary contact” on that business deal in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2016,</span> received emails from Ruffalo Noel Levitz a few days later, asking her to sign up for a “new associate training workshop” later in the year.
</span>In an email to Castellano the same year, Ruffalo Noel Levitz asked her to help pitch <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $13,590</span>-per-person certification program to potential customers. “Please encourage the teams on your client campuses to consider the program,” the email said.
Dave Kielmeyer, a university spokesman, said Castellano attended the consultant training <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 and</span> has since done two paid consulting projects for the company. She got approval from the school, which did not see the work as a conflict, Kielmeyer said. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Castellano “has a role in hiring vendors,” he said, but the school’s provost or chief financial officer must approve consulting contracts.
</span>Admissions officers at Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette universities say that they have disclosed their consulting roles with their colleges and are careful not to work with competing schools. Nijhawan, the Ruffalo Noel Levitz CEO, said in an interview that the program is aimed at helping school administrators “share knowledge across the industry.”
Matching ‘cookies’ to student identities
Some of the same technologies that big companies use to track users and show ads to consumers are gaining traction in college admissions. One example is Capture Higher Ed’s behavioral tracking service, which relies on cookies to record every click students make when they visit a university website.
Each visitor to the university site gets a cookie, which sends Capture information including that person’s Internet protocol address, the type of computer and browser they are using, what time of day they visited the site and which pages within the site they clicked on, according to Patrick Jackson, chief technology officer for digital privacy firm Disconnect, who reviewed college websites on behalf of The Post.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Every time that person returns to the site, Capture learns more information about them, such as their interest in athletics or the amount of time they spend on financial aid pages, according to promotional videos on the company’s website.
</span>Initially, the cookies identify each visitor by the IP address, a unique code associated with a computer’s Internet connection, but Capture also offers software tools to match the cookie data with people’s real identities, according to the company’s promotional videos. Colleges do this by sending marketing emails to thousands of prospective students, inviting them to click on a hyperlink inside the message for more information about a particular topic, according to the videos.
When a student clicks on the link, Capture learns which email address is associated with which IP address, connecting the student’s real identity to the college’s snapshot of the student’s Web browsing history, Capture executives said in one of the videos.
“We are embedding links in every email,” Billy Pierce, then director of undergraduate admission at the University of Toledo, a Capture customer, said onstage at a college admissions conference <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> “You want more of the identified visitors coming to your website because those are the kids that you have their name, their address, their email, sometimes their phone number — any information you have in your system now gets tied to their behavior,” Pierce said at the conference, a video of which was posted to YouTube.
Meghan Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the University of Toledo, said the school uses Capture’s software code on its website and in some — not all — of its marketing emails in an effort to give students information relevant to them. In an email, Pierce added that students choose to give their names and contact information to the school.
Admissions officers say behavioral tracking helps them serve students in the application process. When a college sees that a qualified student is serious about applying based on the student’s Web behavior, it can dedicate more staffers to follow up.
“An admissions counselor may only have an hour in a given day to make contact with prospective students,” Chrissy Holliday, vice president of enrollment at Colorado State University at Pueblo — a Capture Higher Ed client — said in an email. “The web data allows the counselor to know which students are currently most engaged and might benefit most from that contact.”
But Web tracking may unfairly provide an advantage to students with better access to technology, said Bradley Shear, a Maryland lawyer who has pushed for better regulation of students’ online privacy. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">A low-income student may be a strong academic candidate but receive less attention from recruiters because the student does not own a smartphone or have high-speed Internet access at home, he said.
</span>“I don’t think the algorithm should run the admissions department,” Shear said."

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Not long after I became treasury secretary <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995,</span> a senior U.S. senator summoned me to Capitol Hill for a meeting.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He demanded to know why our department had just opened a community development office, tasked with focusing on poverty, inner-cities and distressed rural areas.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Treasury’s purview is economic policy,” the senator said.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“What exactly do poverty and social issues have to do with your job?”
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The answer to that question has never been more important than it is today: Anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, often called food stamps) and other safety-net programs designed to assist low-income Americans are not only social and moral imperatives — they serve critically important economic purposes.
</span>To start, these are vital public investments with high rates of return. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They improve productivity and reduce social costs caused by crime, malnutrition and poor health.</span> For adults, Medicaid and SNAP better enable effective participation in the workforce.
<span id=""7"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 20 percent</span> of U.S. children live in poverty.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">In the wealthiest country in the world, that’s not just a moral outrage — it’s a serious detriment to our economic future.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">For low-income children, Medicaid and SNAP are investments that significantly improve outcomes later in life.</span> For example, one study found that children who received SNAP were less likely to experience stunted growth, heart disease and obesity as adults — and had graduation rates that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 18 percentage</span> points higher. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">We need to do more, not less, to help these children — by providing early family intervention, better schools and housing, safer neighborhoods and much else.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">What’s more, these programs serve as “automatic stabilizers” during an economic downturn: In a weak economy, as more people lose income and become eligible for federal benefits, the programs expand, putting more money in more people’s pockets.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">People then spend that money, increasing demand and helping the economy recover.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">All this adds up to a clear but underappreciated reality: Anti-poverty programs are an economic imperative.</span> And yet their future is in jeopardy.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The majorities in Congress have advocated capping or “block granting” federal spending on Medicaid and SNAP — and the Trump administration is also expected to pursue a budget that restructures them.</span> Over time, the effect would be major cuts to these programs. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The more immediate effect would be to eliminate the programs’ ability to automatically adjust to meet increased need, whether from a weakened economy, natural disaster or public-health crises such as the opioid epidemic.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Low-income programs that depend on annual appropriations are also at risk if the president and Congress follow through on plans to bring domestic spending to historically low levels.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">The threat to these programs is particularly grave this year because of the desire to lower corporate and individual income taxes.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Corporate tax cuts and certain structural reforms could increase U.S. competitiveness globally and business investment, economic activity and labor demand, which could, in turn, boost jobs and wages.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">But significant cuts to top personal income-tax rates or to capital gains taxes, or the elimination of the estate tax, would disproportionately benefit those at the top, while providing little or no gains for workers or the broader economy.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Such rate reductions, on both the personal and corporate side, would also increase fiscal deficits, even after reasonable adjustments for projected economic growth, if unpaid for.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">There will be tremendous pressure to offset those deficits by cutting anti-poverty programs.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Moreover, the most likely path forward for a tax bill is through “reconciliation,” the filibuster-proof legislative process for passing budgetary bills in the Senate.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Reconciliation bills must adhere to certain rules, including a requirement that they not add to the deficit in years beyond the next decade.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2001,</span> Congress circumvented this problem by “sunsetting” the Bush rate cuts. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">But the majority party in Congress is unlikely to want a major structural overhaul of the tax system to be temporary.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That’s because such structural reforms require businesses to make long-term organizational and financial changes.</span> All this suggests there will be even greater pressure to make major cuts to programs for the poor.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Even if certain tax changes are economically beneficial on their own, funding them with cuts to anti-poverty programs would be counterproductive.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The constructive alternative would be to finance rate cuts by removing or limiting deductions and other tax breaks.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">But these provisions have strong special-interest support and are unlikely to change much.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The threat to anti-poverty programs, which unfortunately have fewer powerful backers, is very real.

</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Just think of how our economy would benefit if we finally marshaled the will and resources to effectively combat poverty.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">It would increase the size and productivity of our workforce, including by equipping children for success, and make our economy more resilient through stronger automatic stabilizers.</span>"

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 16,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 3</span>:58 pm ET

BARCELONA—Albert Rivera launched his political party nine years ago by posing nude in a campaign poster, his hands carefully arrayed to avoid an obscenity charge.</span> Now, in a highly volatile election year in Spain, polls show the political upstart is Spain’s most well-regarded politician.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">His party Ciudadanos, or Citizens, which favors free-market economics and liberal social policies, has soared in the polls nationally by capitalizing on disenchantment with Spain’s two main parties and discomfort with a new leftist movement, Podemos.

</span>Ciudadanos only recently began expanding beyond its base in Spain’s wealthy Catalonia region. But in a survey released this week by the Metroscopia, a polling firm, it was neck-and-neck with the other three parties, trailing front-runner Podemos by less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 points</span>—within the poll’s margin of error.

Support for Ciudadanos, which trumpets a message of “sensible change” to distinguish itself from the more firebrand Podemos, has more than doubled since January, Metroscopia found.

With a national election due late this year, the party suddenly finds itself attracting attention for its ideas instead of the 35-year-old Mr. Rivera’s marketing stunts.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Last week, Mr. Rivera and his advisers proposed overhauling Spain’s moribund economy by making entrepreneurship and research and development, rather than large infrastructure projects, the main economic engine.

</span>The plan set Twitter abuzz. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“We made the economy a trending topic and in Spain, no one wants to talk about the economy,” Mr. Rivera said in an interview.</span> He has been picking up Twitter followers this year at a rate <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7,500 a</span> week.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Rivera has emerged as a player as Spain’s post-Franco political establishment wobbles amid corruption scandals and a persistent economic crisis.

</span>A youth swimming champion who hails from a middle-class family and was trained as a lawyer, he hasn’t been sullied by scandal and is also young enough to share some of the antiestablishment appeal of Podemos, analysts said.

“Voters want new faces and people not compromised by the traditional power structure,” said Emilio Sáenz-Francés, professor of history and international relations at Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid.

He said Mr. Rivera shrewdly delayed the national launch of his party until Podemos took the plunge first. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Under the glare of increasing public scrutiny, Podemos has lost momentum in the polls over concerns about its leaders’ financial and ideological ties to Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s late president.

</span>Mr. Sáenz-Francés said long-established parties may be forced to enter into alliances with Ciudadanos to govern in Spain’s major cities and perhaps even nationally.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Mr. Rivera’s Catalan roots may put him in a better position to reach an accommodation with separatists in Catalonia, which accounts for one-quarter of Spain’s exports.</span> Ciudadanos staunchly opposes the region’s powerful independence movement.

Political columnist Javier Prats is less sanguine about Ciudadanos’ prospects. He recently likened efforts by Mr. Rivera’s party to compete with the Popular Party, which governs nationally, and the main opposition Socialists to those of a second-division Spanish soccer club trying to play in the big leagues.

“The game is on, but sooner or later Madrid and Barça always come back to win La Liga,” he wrote.

Mr. Rivera faces a huge struggle managing the growth of a party whose membership in March alone surged <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 33% to</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,000.</span> He has been working overtime to fill candidate lists so Ciudadanos can contest May municipal elections <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1,100 towns</span>.

That rush has led to some embarrassment. Ciudadanos was forced to expel a youth coordinator in Madrid who was found to have a history of xenophobic and anti-Catalan tweets. Other activists have come under fire for indiscrete comments on social media. “You can’t just take cellphones away from party members,” Mr. Rivera sighs.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said voters opting for the untested Ciudadanos were “playing roulette,” and he ridiculed the party’s recruitment efforts. “We’re not one of those parties that is looking for candidates in cafeterias,” he said.

Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said Ciudadanos doesn’t represent real change, but is rather a “substitute” for the current discredited leadership class. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Rivera fired back, calling Podemos “a new party with old ideas” about expanding the state’s role in the economy.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Rivera’s challenge to what he sees as stale economic thinking has been aided by some well-known university economists, including Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

</span>In decrying Spain’s penchant for white-elephant projects, Ciudadanos proposes redirecting about a third of the more than €3 billion ($3.2 billion) that is spent annually on high-speed rail to build a network of research centers to develop marketable new technologies.

“We’ve been criticized for this by the Popular Party and the Socialists because they are the ones who made all these high-speed rail lines without passengers and all the empty airports,” Mr. Rivera said.

Entrepreneurs are warming to the party. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Alicia Macías, who launched an online jewelry company, dWappo.com, after losing a consulting job at Accenture PLC <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> was impressed with Mr. Rivera’s proposal to lower taxes and cut bureaucracy for startup companies.

</span>She voted for Ciudadanos in a regional election in the Andalusia region in March, in which the party outperformed expectations.

“I like their political program,” Ms. Macías said, adding that its policies on entrepreneurship are “very coherent.”

Fed officials project lower rate path <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 and</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> and in the longer run
WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate steady on Wednesday and officials lowered projections of how much they expect to raise short-term interest rates in the coming years, signs that persistently slow economic growth and low inflation are forcing the central bank to rethink how fast it can move rates higher.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“We are quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term,” Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">New projections show officials expect the fed-funds rate to rise <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.875% by</span> the end <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to the median projection <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 17 officials</span>.</span> Their forecasts imply they see two rate increases this year. That is the same number of increases they saw when they last released projections in March. However a greater number of officials now see one increase, rather than two. In March only one official saw one rate increase this year and seven saw three or more. Now six officials see one increase this year and only two see three or more.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen said a rate increase at the Fed’s next meeting in July is “not impossible,” but she doesn’t know how quickly officials will gain confidence the economy is on firm footing.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“We need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,” she said.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The central bank also sees the fed funds rate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1.625% by</span> the end <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017 and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.375% at</span> the end of<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> lower than quarterly projections officials released in March.</span> Three months ago the median estimate for rates <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 was</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3%.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">In the longer run, the Fed expects its benchmark rate to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 3%,</span> lower than <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 3.25% they</span> saw in March.
</span>These projections aren’t set in stone, but they do indicate how officials’ views are changing. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed doesn’t see rates going as high as it saw before, and it sees taking a longer time to get to the endpoint officials have in mind.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,” Ms. Yellen said.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The upcoming British referendum on whether to leave the European Union was also a factor in Fed officials’ decision to leave rates unchanged, and “clearly could have consequences” for economic and global financial markets, the Fed chief added.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“If it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,” Ms. Yellen said of the so-called Brexit vote, set for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23.</span>
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In their official policy statement released after the meeting, Fed officials repeated the refrain they’ve been using all year that they expect “economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The central bank in December pushed its benchmark interest rate up from near zero to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 0.25% and</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.5%.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">So far, the economy and financial markets haven’t cooperated with plans to keep moving rates up.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Early in the year, market turbulence and slow growth in economic output gave officials pause.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Growth appears to have picked up and markets settled down, but now hiring and expected inflation are a cause of concern for officials, a mixed backdrop making them reluctant to act.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“The pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up,” the Fed said.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">While consumer spending has strengthened, business investment has been soft.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Meantime, market indicators of expected inflation have declined, the Fed said, a development Ms. Yellen noted earlier this month was of some concern.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The tone of the Fed’s official statement and projections suggest officials will need to see a quick turnaround in economic data and evidence of market resilience if they are to move promptly.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The Fed indicated its views about risks to the economy haven’t shifted much since April.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">As they said then, officials said they would “closely monitor” inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.</span> That isn’t a strong endorsement of the outlook. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">At moments of more confidence, as in December when the Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, the Fed said risks to the economy were balanced.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">The Fed slightly reduced its estimate for how much economic output will expand this year, shifting its March projection <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.2% output</span> growth <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%.</span></span></span> It also nudged down <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2017 growth</span> projection by one tenth of one percent <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">At the same time it nudged up its inflation projection for the year <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.4% from</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.2%,</span> but held most of its other projections steady.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">The combination of relatively stable economic projections and a lower interest rate outlook suggest officials are slowly coming to the conclusion that the economy simply can’t bear very high interest rates, even to achieve mediocre growth and low inflation.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen has said headwinds are holding back the economy.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It might be the case that those headwinds are persisting longer than she expected, or new ones are emerging, such as China’s economic slowdown.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Officials also have been weighing whether the economy’s equilibrium interest rate—a rate at which the economy is in balance with stable inflation and low unemployment—has fallen because of long-running trends holding back growth and beyond the Fed’s control, such as the retirement of workers and low productivity growth.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Fed officials last month appeared poised to raise rates in June or July.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen said in late May a move was probable “in the coming months” if the economy continued to strengthen.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">A dismal May employment report, coupled with concerns about the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 British</span> referendum on whether to leave the European Union, gave officials pause as they weigh when to next raise rates.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Employers added <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 38,000 jobs</span> in May and payroll growth in April and March was revised lower, the Labor Department said earlier this month.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">The share of Americans participating in the workforce also declined, and the number of employees stuck in part-time jobs rose, the report showed.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Still, the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance remains at historically low levels.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The decision not to raise rates Wednesday follows recent comments from Ms. Yellen that officials want to wait for more assurance the hiring slowdown is not a harbinger of underlying weakness in the broader economy.
</span>Ahead of Wednesday’s release, futures markets <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">put 1.9% probability</span> on a rate increase in June and <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20.6% probability</span> on a move in July.

21227,"<h3>China, China, China: Beijing Cuts Reserves, but Investors Yawn</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">As temperature fluctuations catch designers and retailers off-guard, a major fashion school wants students to learn more about predicting what’s ahead

Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 7</span>:00 am ET

At a recent class at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, students were asked—and promised a Dunkin’ Donuts gift card for the right answer to—the question: When should a Los Angeles store stock swimsuits?

Sarah Corcoran, a senior, explained she would use a “maximum temperature metric” to figure out the problem.</span> “Yes,” cheered her professor, Calvin Williamson. And she earned the gift card.

FIT, one of the largest and best-known fashion schools, with alumni including Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali and Brian Atwood, this semester launched a new, 15-week course called “Predictive Analytics for Planning and Forecasting: Case Studies with Weatherization.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The course, geared toward students interested in retail and merchandising careers, is part of a broad overhaul of FIT’s curriculum to include more topical business issues, and weather is a prime one.

</span>Weather fluctuations have increasingly been putting fashion designers and clothing retailers on the defensive. Merchandise is often ordered months in advance based on what the weather typically is at that time of year. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But when temperatures are different from what was predicted—milder-than-usual winters, cold springs or otherwise inconsistent weather—clothes that are all wrong for the climate stay on racks and get discounted, hurting sales.

</span>Last winter was the warmest on record for the contiguous U.S., says Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. The average temperature <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 36.8 degrees</span> Fahrenheit,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.6 degrees</span> above average, with some parts of the country even higher above average. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">That led to less demand for heavy winter coats.

</span>J.C. Penney Co. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Chief Executive Marvin Ellison recently told analysts warm weather hurt apparel sales for the quarter that ended Oct.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29.</span></span> He cited the “warmest September ever on record” as a factor. Some mass retailers hire or consult climatologists to help them make such predictions.

Designer Michael Kors makes a point of including a range of fabric weights for his resort collections, instead of limiting them to the lightweight clothing and beachwear those collections have historically featured. Mr. Kors has cited the reality of unexpectedly chilly days or nights and unpredictable weather.

Some designer labels, such as Vince, are promoting seasonless clothing, or clothing that is neither too heavy or too light, with pieces that can be layered on or taken off depending on how cool or warm it gets.

“Because of the extreme weather changes, there’s no real separation between spring, fall, winter and summer,” says fashion designer Jason Wu, who is best known for <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 and</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 inaugural</span> gowns he created for Michelle Obama. Mr. Wu used wool, a fabric normally associated with autumn and winter, for a number of runway looks in his latest spring collection.

“People aren’t really used to seeing wool in spring,” he says. “We wanted to highlight the idea of cool wool. Extremely light wool.” Mr. Wu partnered with the Woolmark Company, the group representing Australian wool growers that promotes the use of wool, on those looks. As an ambassador for Woolmark, he receives support from the group.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">FIT’s predictive weathering class is co-taught by Prof. Williamson and Gary Wolf, an assistant professor of fashion business management in the college’s</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Jay and Patty Baker School of Business and Technology.

</span>At FIT, the predictive class is advanced, with terms like “linear regression” (a statistical method that examines the relationships between a number of variables) freely tossed out. Charts, graphs, equations and formulas are scribbled on white boards as students follow the lesson and plug numbers into Excel spreadsheets. Prof. Williamson teaches the statistics portion of the course, while Prof. Wolf teaches merchandising and marketing.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In one exercise, students worked to forecast which weeks a retailer in Chicago would have to stock more fleece by incorporating weather data into their calculations.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Melissa Weilacher, a senior majoring in international fashion business management, hadn’t considered the need to learn about weather as important to her education.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The idea that business is so affected” by a few changes in temperature surprised her, she says.</span> “It can make you one step ahead of a competitor who is just looking at what happened last winter. You can’t just rely on what happened last year because things like that don’t happen all the time.”

The school also brings in industry professionals. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">A guest instructor, Mohan Anand, visited from Planalytics, a Berwyn, Pa.-based firm that helps retail companies metrically assess how weather impacts their business.</span> Mr. Anand, director of research and analytics, came with his colleague, Evan M. Gold, executive vice president of global services. Among its clients: Dunkin’ Donuts. It helps the chain determine when to promote certain menu items.

‘Covid, Covid, Covid’: In Trump’s Final Chapter, a Failure to Rise to the Moment
As the U.S. confronted a new wave of infection and death through the summer and fall, the president’s approach to the pandemic came down to a single question: What would it mean for him?
WASHINGTON — It was a warm summer Wednesday, Election Day was looming and President Trump was even angrier than usual at the relentless focus on the coronavirus pandemic.
“You’re killing me! This whole thing is! We’ve got all the damn cases,” Mr. Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19.</span> “I want to do what Mexico does. They don’t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you’re vomiting.”
Mexico’s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.
And on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Mr. Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week.
“They’re Democrats! They’re against me!” he said, convinced that the government’s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. “They want to wait!”
Throughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a re-election campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Mr. Trump’s management of the crisis — unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year — was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?
The result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Mr. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joseph R. Biden Jr., but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.
Efforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign’s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day — a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September — became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.
</span>His concern? That the man he called “Sleepy Joe” Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.
The government’s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.
With Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Dr. Atlas became the sole doctor Mr. Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths is exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.
As the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Mr. Trump had allowed to plague the administration’s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.
The administration had some positive stories to tell. Mr. Trump’s vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, had helped drive the pharmaceutical industry’s remarkably fast progress in developing several promising approaches. By the end of the year, two highly effective vaccines would be approved for emergency use, providing hope <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2021.</span>
The White House rejected any suggestions that the president’s response had fallen short, saying he had worked to provide adequate testing, protective equipment and hospital capacity and that the vaccine development program had succeeded in record time.
“President Trump has led the largest mobilization of the public and private sectors since WWII to defeat Covid-19 and save lives,” said Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman.
But Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to put aside his political self-centeredness as Americans died by the thousands each day or to embrace the steps necessary to deal with the crisis remains confounding even to some administration officials. “Making masks a culture war issue was the dumbest thing imaginable,” one former senior adviser said.
His own bout with Covid-19 in early October left him extremely ill and dependent on care and drugs not available to most Americans, including a still-experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, and he saw firsthand how the disease coursed through the White House and some of his close allies.
Yet his instinct was to treat that experience not as a learning moment or an opportunity for empathy, but as a chance to portray himself as a Superman who had vanquished the disease. His own experience to the contrary, he assured a crowd at the White House just a week after his hospitalization, “It’s going to disappear; it is disappearing.”
Weeks after his own recovery, he would still complain about the nation’s preoccupation with the pandemic.
“All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Mr. Trump said at one campaign stop, uttering the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">word 11 times</span>.
In the end he could not escape it.
‘The Base Will Revolt’
By late July, new cases were at record highs, defying Mr. Trump’s predictions through the spring that the virus was under control, and deaths were spiking to alarming levels. Herman Cain, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 Republican</span> presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus; the previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.
With the pandemic defining the campaign despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president’s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Mr. Trump’s supporters.
Arrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Mr. Trump’s advisers listened as Mr. Fabrizio presented the numbers. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus’s effects on their personal financial situation, the president’s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.
</span>But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio’s finding that more <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 70 percent</span> of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.
Mr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a “no-brainer.”
Mr. Kushner had some reason for optimism. Mr. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.
But Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff — backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller — said the politics for Mr. Trump would be devastating.
“The base will revolt,” Mr. Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Mr. Trump could legally make it happen in any case.
That was all Mr. Trump needed to hear. “I’m not doing a mask mandate,” he concluded.
Aside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.
The president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.
Covid-19 Vaccines ›
Answers to Your Vaccine Questions
With distribution of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in the U.S., here are answers to some questions you may be wondering about:
- If I live in the U.S., when can I get the vaccine? While the exact order of vaccine recipients may vary by state, most will likely put medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities first. If you want to understand how this decision is getting made, this article will help.
- When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated? Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they’ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected. A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it’s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they’re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don’t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus. So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds, and so on. Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fall 2021.</span>
- If I’ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes, but not forever. Here’s why. The coronavirus vaccines are injected deep into the muscles and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. This appears to be enough protection to keep the vaccinated person from getting ill. But what’s not clear is whether it’s possible for the virus to bloom in the nose — and be sneezed or breathed out to infect others — even as antibodies elsewhere in the body have mobilized to prevent the vaccinated person from getting sick. The vaccine clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated people are protected from illness — not to find out whether they could still spread the coronavirus. Based on studies of flu vaccine and even patients infected with Covid-19, researchers have reason to be hopeful that vaccinated people won’t spread the virus, but more research is needed. In the meantime, everyone — even vaccinated people — will need to think of themselves as possible silent spreaders and keep wearing a mask. Read more here.
- Will it hurt? What are the side effects? The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection into your arm won’t feel different than any other vaccine, but the rate of short-lived side effects does appear higher than a flu shot. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines, and none of them have reported any serious health problems. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of Covid-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 25 to</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 33 percent</span> of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills and muscle pain. While these experiences aren’t pleasant, they are a good sign that your own immune system is mounting a potent response to the vaccine that will provide long-lasting immunity.
- Will mRNA vaccines change my genes? No. The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a genetic molecule to prime the immune system. That molecule, known as mRNA, is eventually destroyed by the body. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which can stimulate the immune system. At any moment, each of our cells may contain hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules, which they produce in order to make proteins of their own. Once those proteins are made, our cells then shred the mRNA with special enzymes. The mRNA molecules our cells make can only survive a matter of minutes. The mRNA in vaccines is engineered to withstand the cell's enzymes a bit longer, so that the cells can make extra virus proteins and prompt a stronger immune response. But the mRNA can only last for a few days at most before they are destroyed.
After he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Mr. Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic’s toll that Mr. Trump had so far failed to show.
When Mr. Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: “I had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we’re going to get through it.”
He refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.
Mr. Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus — or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.
Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: “We have the proof. They work.” But the president resisted, criticizing Mr. Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing — an area Mr. Kushner had been helping to oversee — for his problems.
“I’m going to lose,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Kushner during debate preparations. “And it’s going to be your fault, because of the testing.”
Mr. Morgenstern, the White House spokesman, said that exchange between the president and Mr. Kushner “never happened.”
Mr. Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Mr. Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Mr. Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.
Divisions and Disagreements
The decision to run the government’s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.
It did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.
Mr. Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.
Keeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Mr. Trump.
The result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president.
“What we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration.
“Someone needed to pull that all together early,” he said. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“It wasn’t the job of the White House, either.</span> This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn’t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things.”
The relationship between Mr. Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.
Dr. Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.
Mr. Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president’s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Mr. Meadows would rail against regulatory “bureaucrats” he thought were more interested in process than outcome.
Some of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.
Vice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Mr. Trump as they battled for re-election that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.
The debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Dr. Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views — which Mr. Trump saw him deliver on Fox News — appealed to the president’s belief that the crisis was overblown.
His arrival <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1600 Pennsylvania</span> Avenue was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president’s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.
Marc Short, Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, opposed hiring Dr. Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Mr. Short insisted that Dr. Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal — and destructive — critic.
Once inside, Dr. Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Dr. Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It’s not a problem.
Dr. Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Your strategy is literally going to cost us lives,” she yelled at Dr. Atlas.</span> She attacked Dr. Atlas’s ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Dr. Hahn, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield even before Dr. Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.
Health officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Mr. Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Mr. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.
One outcome of the meeting was a Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19 news</span> conference on the virus’s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Mr. Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to “do their part” to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Mr. Trump’s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that “decision making at the local level” was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.
Mr. Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Mr. Pence took over the task force. Mr. Azar would complain to his associates that Mr. Pence’s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On tenterhooks about his job status, Mr. Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government’s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Mr. Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.
</span>Behind the scenes, Mr. Azar portrayed Dr. Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager — a complaint he also voiced about Dr. Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Dr. Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.
For their part, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Birx and other senior health officials saw Mr. Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.
Health officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Mr. Azar to Mr. Pence’s office, hoping for an intervention.
Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, said he had “always stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions.”
Once eager to visit the White House, Dr. Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.
If there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Dr. Atlas.
He told Mr. Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much “excess mortality” there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.
Mr. Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10,000 people</span>.
As of Thursday,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 342,577 Americans</span> had died from the pandemic.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Trump vs. Vaccine Regulators
In an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.
</span>Pfizer’s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Mr. Trump’s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.
Dr. Fauci and Dr. Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company’s vaccine trial results were a “black box,” impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a “Pyrrhic victory,” Mr. Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.
Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Mr. Trump sometimes complained in meetings that “it was not going to happen before the election and it will be ‘Sleepy Joe’” who would ultimately get credit.
In late October, science and regulations worked against Mr. Trump’s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the F.D.A., scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few Covid-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.
They decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.
When Pfizer announced on Nov.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9 </span>— two days after Mr. Biden clinched his victory — that its vaccine was a stunning success, Mr. Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Dr. Hahn and the F.D.A., accusing “deep state regulators” of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.
The president’s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the F.D.A. went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer’s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.
On Dec.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> Mr. Meadows exploded during a morning call with Dr. Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency’s top vaccine regulator. He accused Dr. Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the F.D.A. authorized the Pfizer vaccine.
In the weeks that followed, Mr. Pence, Mr. Azar, Dr. Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.
Mr. Trump, who after contracting Covid-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.

Covid-19 Vaccines ›
Words to Know About Vaccines
Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated? Let us help:
- Adverse event: A health problem that crops up in volunteers in a clinical trial of a vaccine or a drug. An adverse event isn’t always caused by the treatment tested in the trial.
- Antibody: A protein produced by the immune system that can attach to a pathogen such as the coronavirus and stop it from infecting cells.
- Approval, licensure and emergency use authorization: Drugs, vaccines and medical devices cannot be sold in the United States without gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, also known as licensure. After a company submits the results of clinical trials to the F.D.A. for consideration, the agency decides whether the product is safe and effective, a process that generally takes many months. If the country is facing an emergency — like a pandemic — a company may apply instead for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted considerably faster.
- Background rate: How often a health problem, known as an adverse event, arises in the general population. To determine if a vaccine or a drug is safe, researchers compare the rate of adverse events in a trial to the background rate.
- Efficacy: The benefit that a vaccine provides compared to a placebo, as measured in a clinical trial. To test a coronavirus vaccine, for instance, researchers compare how many people in the vaccinated and placebo groups get Covid-19. Effectiveness, by contrast, is the benefit that a vaccine or a drug provides out in the real world. A vaccine's effectiveness may turn out to be lower or higher than its efficacy.
- <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phase 1,</span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span> <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 3 trials</span>: Clinical trials typically take place in three stages. <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phase 1 trials</span> usually involve a few dozen people and are designed to observe whether a vaccine or drug is safe. <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phase 2 trials</span>, involving hundreds of people, allow researchers to try out different doses and gather more measurements about the vaccine’s effects on the immune system. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phase 3 trials</span>, involving thousands or tens of thousands of volunteers, determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine or drug by waiting to see how many people are protected from the disease it’s designed to fight.
- Placebo: A substance that has no therapeutic effect, often used in a clinical trial. To see if a vaccine can prevent Covid-19, for example, researchers may inject the vaccine into half of their volunteers, while the other half get a placebo of salt water. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They can then compare how many people in each group get infected.
- Post-market surveillance: The monitoring that takes place after a vaccine or drug has been approved and is regularly prescribed by doctors.</span> This surveillance typically confirms that the treatment is safe. On rare occasions, it detects side effects in certain groups of people that were missed during clinical trials.
- Preclinical research: Studies that take place before the start of a clinical trial, typically involving experiments where a treatment is tested on cells or in animals.
- Viral vector vaccines: A type of vaccine that uses a harmless virus to chauffeur immune-system-stimulating ingredients into the human body. Viral vectors are used in several experimental Covid-19 vaccines, including those developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Both of these companies are using a common cold virus called an adenovirus as their vector. The adenovirus carries coronavirus genes.
- Trial protocol: A series of procedures to be carried out during a clinical trial.

Russia-Ukraine WarAs Russia Increases the Size of Its Army, Both Sides Dig In for a Long Conflict

President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision this week to expand the size of his military offered further evidence for a conviction taking hold in both Russia and Ukraine: The two sides are settling in for the long haul in a war that could last another year, or longer.
Mr. Putin, secure in his power and having silenced dissent, appears to have little incentive to stop the war, which he has now waged for more than six months without declaring a nationwide draft that could have provoked domestic discontent.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, warning his nation on Friday that the coming winter would be “the most difficult in our history,” is being bolstered by a largely unified West and a defiant populace in his insistence that there will be no compromise with an invading army.
The conflict has settled into a war of attrition, with little movement along the front line in recent weeks, even as both Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin face growing political pressure to show results on the battlefield.
Ukraine has held off from mounting a large-scale counteroffensive despite claiming for months that one was coming, and Russia has avoided sharply escalating its assault despite warning that it would retaliate against Ukrainian attacks in the Russian-controlled peninsula of Crimea.
“Expectations that this will end by Christmas or that this will end by next spring” are misguided, said Ruslan Pukhov, a defense analyst who runs the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a privately-owned think tank in Moscow.
Ukraine, benefiting from a continuing flow of Western weapons like <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 billion</span> package that President Biden pledged this week, has the resources and morale to continue to resist the Russian assault. Russia, fighting the war at peacetime strength without mass call-ups of military-age men, appears to have the resources to keep waging a brutal war of attrition — but not to mount a decisive new offensive.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The largely static period on the battlefield coincides with increasing expectations — fueled by Ukraine itself — that Mr. Zelensky’s military will mount some kind of significant offensive, to show that it can make good use of Western-provided weapons and reassure allies that the economic sacrifices they are making will pay off.
</span>Mr. Putin, as well, faces domestic pressure from far-right nationalists who want stepped-up aggression in Ukraine, particularly after recent strikes on Crimea and the killing of the ultranationalist commentator Daria Dugina in a car bombing last weekend. But the Russian leader, in control of the state media and the political system, is well-situated to ignore such calls, analysts say.
Instead, Mr. Putin insists that his forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region “step by step.”
However, Russia has failed to capture a single major population center since early July. And for Mr. Putin, who justified the invasion by falsely claiming that Ukraine was committing a “genocide” of Russian speakers in the Donbas, anything short of full control of the region would be seen as a major defeat.
Mr. Putin’s decree on Thursday raised the target number of active-duty Russian service members <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 137,000,</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.15 million</span>.
In the Russian state media, the message that Russia could only be at the start of a long and existential war against the West — now being fought, by proxy, in Ukraine — is sounding with increasing clarity. It is a shift from the messaging six months ago, when Ukrainians were depicted as lacking the will to fight and eagerly awaiting Russian “liberation.”
“We will have fewer Russian tourists in Europe, but the size of the Russian army will increase <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 140,000 regular</span> servicemen,” Igor Korotchenko, the editor of a Russian military journal, said on a state television talk show on Thursday. “I expect that this is just the beginning.”
Milana Mazaeva contributed reporting.
As the bloody artillery battle in Ukraine’s east settles into a stalemate, the war appears now to be a waiting game for a long-promised Ukrainian counteroffensive.
The timing for any move to break the deadlock has emerged as a pivotal strategic decision for Ukraine’s government. Both sides are preparing for a protracted war, but Ukraine has greater incentive to try to avoid it by undertaking risky maneuvers as early as this fall — before the rainy season closes the window on possible offensives over open fields.
From the Ukrainian perspective, the mostly static trench fighting cannot go on indefinitely. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Leaving Russia in control of much of the southern coastline would cripple Ukraine’s economy, already cratering from the war and propped up by Western aid.
</span>The initial target of any counterattack is widely assumed to be Russian positions on the western bank of the Dnipro River. Move too soon, though, and the Ukrainian army may prove unready and insufficiently armed to ensure victory, military analysts say. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Wait too long, and political backing in Europe may waver as energy prices soar.
</span>Political pressure is mounting for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a move even as it remains unclear whether his military has amassed the necessary weaponry and manpower.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The very difficult state of our economy, the constant risks of air and missile attacks and the general fatigue of the population from the difficulties of war will work against Ukraine” over time, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former minister of defense, wrote in the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper.</span> He said the military should be prepared to advance, rather than defend.
“It makes no sense to drag out the war for years and compete to see who will run out of resources first,” he wrote.
The Ukrainians pivoted to a new strategy of so-called “deep war” — hitting targets far behind the front — after months of grim artillery duels and street fighting in the eastern region of Luhansk, which ultimately fell under Russian control by early July.
Using long-range, precision guided rockets provided by the United States, the Ukrainian military has been softening up Russian positions behind the front line while also striking the Russian-occupied Crimea Peninsula.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Ukrainian government has said that, since late June, it has hit at <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 154 ammunition</span> depots,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 91 bases</span> for weapons storage, four barracks housing soldiers, four fuel depots and eight command posts.</span> Those claims could not be independently verified.
But Ukraine has for months been telegraphing plans for the major battle in the south — with the types of weapons it has requested from Western allies and the strategies it pursues on the battlefield offering clues to its approach.
A recent U.S. military assistance package tellingly included mine-clearing attachments for armored vehicles that would be used in an advance, suggesting preparations for attacks on Russian lines.
But more time would bring more Western weaponry: Despite the arrival of artillery systems from NATO members, Ukraine’s arsenal is still largely made up of legacy Soviet arms.
At home in Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky has broad support for continuing the war. An opinion poll by the Razumkov Center, a policy research organization in Kyiv, released on Monday <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">showed 92 percent</span> of Ukrainians are confident in a military victory over the Russian army.
But Russian plans to stage referendums in occupied territory could lead to a claim of annexation as early as next month, putting additional time pressure on Mr. Zelensky to launch an offensive.
The State of the War
- Defiant Under Attack: Amid the blare of air raid sirens, Ukrainians celebrated their Independence Day with a show of defiance against Russia’s invasion, despite the uncertain course of a war that has so far lasted half a year.
- Nuclear Plant Standoff: Russian and Ukrainian militaries are continuing to accuse each other of launching missiles and preparing to stage attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The United Nations issued warnings about the risk of a nuclear disaster and called for a demilitarized zone around the plant.
- A Brazen Bombing: A car bombing in a Moscow suburb that killed the daughter of a prominent Russian ultranationalist has injected new uncertainty into the war and rattled Russia’s elite.
- Crimea: With the drumbeat of Ukrainian strikes inside the strategically and symbolically important Kremlin-held territory, the reality of war is becoming increasingly apparent to Russians.
KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s largest nuclear plant was reconnected to the national power grid on Friday afternoon, but its time offline renewed concerns about the safe operation of the plant and the consequences for millions of Ukrainians if there are further interruptions to power.
Ukrainian engineers were able to restore damaged external power lines after repeated shelling on Thursday, ensuring the facility was able to meet its own power needs and continue to operate safely, according to Ukrainian and international officials, but efforts to reconnect it to the grid took longer.
With fires raging around the plant, new shelling in and around the facility on a near daily basis and an exhausted and stressed team of Ukrainian engineers tasked with keeping the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant running safely, however, calls for international intervention grew louder.
“Nowhere in the history of this world has a nuclear power plant become a part of a combat zone, so this really has to stop immediately,” Bonnie Denise Jenkins, the State Department’s under secretary for arms control and international security, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian actions, she said, “have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident — a dangerous radiation release — that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine, but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community.”
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine used his nightly address to underscore the risks, saying emergency systems had worked on Thursday, but that, had they failed, the country, and the world, would be contending with a nuclear accident.
And though the immediate threat appeared to have been averted, the disconnection of the plant from the national grid caused widespread power outages across southern Ukraine, adding to the misery wrought by the war. When fully operational, the plant provides electricity for <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 20 percent</span> of the country, including roughly four million homes.
The Zhaporizhzhia regional government said that as of Friday morning, energy supplies were “partially restored” from other sources. Residents across the region reported widespread power outages overnight and into the morning.
The plant was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid at 2:04 p.m., according to Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom. The agency, in a statement, praised the workers at the plant who “tirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders.” It was not immediately clear how many people were still without power.
Ukrainians in occupied areas are already living under difficult conditions. In eastern Ukraine, Russian bombardments and fierce fighting have destroyed nearly all of the infrastructure needed to provide heat, power and clean water, leading the Ukrainian government to order a mandatory evacuation of the less <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200,000 people</span> still living in the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas.
The situation in the occupied south is more complicated. Many of the towns and cities there fell in the first days of the war and were spared the widespread destruction witnessed in the east. But if the nuclear plant were to go offline again, the power for hundreds of thousands living in occupied territories could be compromised.
“The south of Ukraine — the occupied areas — is already in a state of humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Zelensky said. “In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off.”
Though the plant’s disconnection from the national grid appeared to be the related to nearby fighting, Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks that Moscow wants to divert the power from the plant for its own needs by disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid and then reconnecting it to the Russian grid, a potentially complicated process in a war zone that leaves room for an accident.
Ms. Jenkins, the State Department official, said the U.S. is working through the United Nations Security Council to persuade Moscow not to attempt such a potentially risky move.
“We don’t want that to happen,” she said. “We are continuing to talk with Russia and through these Security Council discussions and to impress upon Russia not to do that.”
In the six months since Russia invaded, the state media’s emphasis in reporting the war has gradually shifted. Gone are predictions of a lightning offensive that would obliterate Ukraine. There is less talk of being embraced as liberators who must “denazify” and demilitarize Ukraine, though the “fascist” label is still flung about with abandon.
Instead, in the Kremlin version — the only one most Russians see, with all others outlawed — the battlefields of Ukraine are one facet of a wider civilizational war being waged against Russia.
The reporting is less about Ukraine than “about opposing Western plans to get control of Mother Russia,” said Stanislav Kucher, a veteran Russian television host now consulting on a project to get Russians better access to banned news outlets.
On state media, Russia is a pillar of traditional values, bound to prevail over the moral swamp that is the West. But the extent of Russia’s staggering casualties in Ukraine remains veiled; only the Ukrainian military suffers extensive losses.
State television has played down the mounting Ukrainian attacks on the strategically and symbolically important Crimean peninsula, but the images on social media of antiaircraft fire erupting over Crimea began to put domestic political pressure on the Kremlin.
The visceral reality of the war, especially the fact that Russian-claimed territory was not immune, was brought home both by the strikes on Crimea and by what investigators called a premeditated assassination in Moscow.
Daria Dugina,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29,</span> the daughter of a famous nationalist and herself a hawk, was killed by a car bomb late Saturday, with official news outlets blaming Ukraine and its Western backers.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Glimpses of the war’s cost, however, remain the exception, as news and talk shows have branched into myriad economic and social topics to try to hammer home the idea that Russia is locked in a broad conflict with the West.
</span>Lev Gudkov, the research director at the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, said the government explains European and American hostility by saying that “Russia is getting stronger and that is why the West is trying to get in Russia’s way,” part of a general rhetorical line he described as “blatant lies and demagogy.”
As state television stokes confrontation, the talk show warriors are getting “angrier and more aggressive,” said Ilya Shepelin, who broadcasts a Russian press review on YouTube for the opposition organization founded by the imprisoned Kremlin critic Aleksei A. Navalny.
The warning by a top U.S. official this week that Russia is preparing to stage “sham” referendums in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine has brought back bad memories of similar episodes from the country’s recent history.
Despite widespread international condemnation, Moscow and its proxies orchestrated two sets of referendums in Ukraine in 2014: first in Russian-annexed Crimea, and then months later in parts of the eastern Donbas region controlled by Kremlin-backed separatist forces.
Now, Washington is warning that history is likely to repeat itself. “We expect Russia to try to manipulate the results of these referenda under the false claim of the Ukrainian people wanting to join Russia,” John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday, adding that votes could take place as early as this weekend.
For months, Russia has been laying the groundwork to hold referendums in the territories it has captured, part of a strategy to provide a veneer of legitimacy as it moves to annex those parts of the country.
The Russian curriculum is being taught in schools. Ukrainians are being encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access state benefits. The Russian authorities have even rerouted mobile phone and internet connections through Russia’s censored networks and, in some areas, blocked access to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as to Ukrainian news websites and other independent sources of information.
“One trick we can expect Russia to repeat is holding a referendum which doesn’t actually give voters any choice,” said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. “<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span></span> people in Crimea voting at gunpoint had two choices on the ballot slip; neither of them was returning to being governed by Ukraine.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">However, in contrast to the Crimea referendums <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span></span> when international condemnation was strong, Mr. Giles said some European leaders may be less vocal now in their criticism of potential referendums, however dubious they may be, if the entrenchment of Russian control curbs the fighting and lessens the global economic impact of the war.
</span>The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground.
However, some experts stressed that the referendums would do little to alter the war’s dynamics or to change the hearts and minds of Ukrainians in areas loyal to Kyiv.
“The referendums will have no influence on the battlefield,” said Oleg Ignatov, senior Russia analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. “If anyone thinks that these referendums will allow them to hold onto these occupied territories, it is very naïve.”
Mr. Ignatov added that any referendum that leads to the annexation of Ukrainian territories would push Kyiv away from the negotiating table, depriving Moscow of an “exit strategy” and locking it into a protracted conflict.
In August, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine warned that any Russian-orchestrated referendum in occupied areas of his country would end all chances of peace talks with Ukraine.
Mr. Ignatov said that any new referendums in occupied territories in Ukraine would not be credible given that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have already fled the occupied regions and would not be able to vote.
“It is nonsense,” he said. “We will not be able to believe any results from these referendums.”
Cluster munitions have killed at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 689 people</span> in Ukraine in the six months since Russia invaded the country, the Cluster Munition Coalition, an international disarmament group, said in its annual report on Thursday.
Cluster munitions include bombs, missiles, rockets, mortar and artillery shells that open midair to dispense smaller weapons or bomblets over a large area that are designed to detonate on impact. Civilians can be easily caught in their path.
And the many bomblets that do not detonate are still volatile, and can explode later if they are picked up or handled. <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> the Cluster Munition Coalition documented incidents in Laos and Lebanon in which groups of children were injured or killed from playing with remnants of cluster munitions.
The researchers could not establish whether all of the <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 700 people</span> killed by the munitions were civilians, as the status of some had not been reported, but said that it was clear that the vast majority were not combatants.
“The civilian harm from the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine is a devastating development that overshadows this year’s report,” Mary Wareham, the arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch and editor of the report, said in a phone interview. Human Rights Watch chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition.
More <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 countries</span>, including most of NATO’s member states, agreed to ban the weapons in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which took effect <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> However, Russia, Ukraine and the United States are not signatories.
Ukraine is the only country where cluster munitions are currently being used, the report said. Both sides in the current war have been documented using the weapons, but Russian troops have used them far more extensively.
Hundreds of Russian attacks with cluster munitions have been documented, reported or alleged <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 of</span> Ukraine’s official regions, according to the new report, while Ukrainian forces have used them at least three times. Russia has used both old stores of cluster munitions and at least two types of newly developed varieties, the report said.
Throughout the war, Russia has shown its willingness to strike civilian targets, including theaters, hospitals and apartment buildings. On Monday, the United Nations reported that it had confirmed the deaths <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5,587 Ukrainian</span> civilians. The true number is thought to be in the tens of thousands.
Human Rights Watch released an investigation last week that found that, in May and June alone, Russian forces launched cluster munitions in Kharkiv that struck homes, city streets, parks, a cultural center and an outpatient clinic at a maternity hospital.
In a statement about the new report, Jeff Meer, the U.S. executive director of Humanity & Inclusion, an independent aid organization, said, “We know two things for sure about cluster munitions: they are indiscriminate weapons, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 98 percent</span> of causalities are civilians.”
WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department and Yale University researchers said Thursday that they had identified at <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 21 sites</span> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that the Russian military or Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists are using to detain, interrogate or deport civilians and prisoners of war in ways that violate international humanitarian law. There were signs pointing to possible mass graves in some areas, they said.
Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said the sites were part of a “filtration system” used for processing detainees and prisoners. They reached their conclusions after examining commercial satellite imagery and open-source information. The detainees and prisoners could be forced to live outside the centers in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, imprisoned for long periods, deported to Russia or even killed.
The research was a collaboration between Yale and the Conflict Observatory program that the State Department set up in May to document war crimes and other atrocities committed by Russian or Russian-backed forces in the Ukraine war. The researchers released their findings through a report from Conflict Observatory.
“We again call on Russia to immediately halt its filtration operations and forced deportations and to provide outside independent observers access to identified facilities and forced deportation relocation areas within Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself,” the State Department said in a statement referring to the new findings.
The report identified four types of centers in the filtration system: registration, holding, secondary interrogation and detention.
The researchers also found evidence of disturbed earth on two recent occasions at the Volnovakha “correctional colony” near the village of Olenivka that they said was consistent with mass graves. The appearance of disturbed earth predated an explosion on <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 29 at</span> the prison compound that <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 53 Ukrainian</span> prisoners of war.
One area of disturbed earth appeared in imagery from <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 11 </span>— “contemporaneous with an open source account of alleged gravedigging,” the report said, referring to an online account in which a former inmate discussed a cellmate working a shift digging graves. A second area of disturbed earth appeared on <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 27,</span> two days before the explosion.
A New York Times analysis from early August of images from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, two satellite imaging companies, concluded that some time after <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18 and</span> before <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 21,</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 to</span><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 spots</span> of notable changes to the ground appeared on the southern side of the complex. They were <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6 to</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7 feet</span> wide <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 10 to</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16 feet</span> long at first, and some later appeared to have been lengthened to merge. It was unclear whether they were grave sites.
The Conflict Observatory report said the Volnovakha center was being used as a long-term detention center for civilians being kept under the auspices of “administrative detention” and for holding prisoners of war, particularly Ukrainians who surrendered after the siege of Azovstal, in the coastal city of Mariupol. “Filtration” activities appear to have begun there in late March and have continued since then.
The researchers noted that there had been reports of torture, beatings, lack of water and proper nutrition, unhygienic conditions and overcrowded cells at the compound.
The State Department said it was giving an <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $9 million</span> to the Conflict Observatory through the European Democratic Resilience Initiative.
“This focus on accountability lays the foundation for future civil and criminal legal processes, whether in Ukraine, through international mechanisms, or in third-party countries that have established jurisdiction,” it said.
“President Putin and his government will not be able to engage in these persistent abuses with impunity,” the department added. “Accountability is imperative, and the United States and our partners will not be silent.”
In June, the U.S. National Intelligence Council released an unclassified report that said it had <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">identified 18 possible</span> locations in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine and western Russia where detainees and prisoners were being held and processed."

On</span> Wednesday, investors took comfort that the Federal Reserve would do whatever was necessary to bring inflation to heel, responding to the rallying cry of the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, by pushing stock prices up.
</span>A day later, reality sank in.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Stocks tumbled on Thursday as investors came to terms with what the Fed’s tougher stance meant for the economy: higher interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 closed</span> down more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 percent</span>, part of a global retreat that saw stocks in Europe also post sharp declines as central banks in other countries raised rates.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">With Thursday’s decline, the S&<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 is</span> now <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 24 percent</span> below its Jan.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 peak</span>, plunging deeper into the bear market that officially began on Monday.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">If stocks continue to fall over the next two weeks, the three-month period that ends <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30 could</span> ultimately be the index’s worst quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008,</span> when the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off the global financial crisis.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The plunge reflects a stark reality for corporations and their shareholders: The fastest inflation in four decades is sapping the buying power of consumers and driving up the cost of materials, transportation, labor and everything else that goes into running a business.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But the Fed’s efforts to fight it might, at least in the short term, prove even worse: By raising rates, the Fed hopes to cool demand enough to tamp down inflation — but the risk is that it does too much, tipping the economy into a recession.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Inflation is not going to come down anytime soon, and it is going to take some kind of slowing of the economy for that to happen,” said Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo.</span> “It’s a really tricky situation.”
Until this week, Mr. Bryson and his team were still betting that the United States could avoid a recession. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But after yet another faster-than-expected inflation report on Friday, and the inevitability that the Fed would get more aggressive as a result, they capitulated: On Wednesday, moments after Mr. Powell finished speaking, Wells Fargo sent a note to clients predicting that a recession would start next year.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The Fed on Wednesday announced its largest rate increase in decades.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It was a forceful — if, in the view of some economists, belated — effort to rein in inflation that has proved more severe and more persistent than most forecasters predicted a year ago.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Other central banks are following suit: The Bank of England announced on Thursday its fifth consecutive interest rate increase, and Switzerland’s central bank raised its interest rate for the first time <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 15 years</span>, a more aggressive move than many expected.
</span>Europe’s <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Stoxx 600 index</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.5 percent</span>, its seventh decline in eight days. The <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">FTSE 100 in</span> London <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 3.1 percent</span>. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 fell</span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The concern on Thursday was evident outside the stock market, too.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Copper and oil prices, which historically serve as measures of sentiment about the global economy, traded lower.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Policymakers hope that by raising the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, they can reduce demand for goods and services and buy time for supply chains and labor markets that have been disrupted by the pandemic to return to normal.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">But bringing down demand, inevitably, means causing economic pain.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">If consumers want fewer goods and services, businesses will have less revenue and will need fewer employees, meaning slower wage growth and, in all likelihood, more layoffs.
</span>There are hints that the recovery, until now among the strongest on record, is losing momentum. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">The once red-hot housing market has cooled rapidly as mortgage rates have risen.</span> Fresh government data showed that builders in May broke ground on the fewest new homes in more than a year.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Average mortgage rates have nearly doubled this year, to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.8 percent</span> on Thursday, from just <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Consumers can also expect to pay more on credit card debt, car loans and certain student loans.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">And retail sales fell in May for the first time this year as sky-high gas prices and rising borrowing costs ate into consumers’ budgets.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The bear market is likely to worsen consumers’ dismal attitudes.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">“Already, households have been squeezed by incredibly high inflation,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global.</span> “You just have to go to take your car to the gas station and feel the pain. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">That means that those high prices, both particularly with food and fuel, mean that a lot of people’s paychecks are going into essentials, very little is left to spend elsewhere.</span> People are feeling the pain and are frustrated by it.”
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Forecasters have steadily marked down their outlook for economic growth in the months ahead.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">IHS Markit on Thursday estimated that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 0.8 percent</span> in the current quarter; last week, they were calling for <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.4 percent</span> growth rate.</span> A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has an even more pessimistic prediction:<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.0 percent</span>.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">Such grim forecasts offer the possibility that the economy could end up shrinking this quarter for the second time in a row — a common, though unofficial, definition of a recession.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">The National Bureau of Economic Research, the country’s semiofficial arbiter of when business cycles begin and end, offers a more nuanced definition of a recession, calling it “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Most economists agree that, by that definition, a recession has not yet begun.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell on Wednesday argued, as he has in the past, that the Fed can bring down inflation without causing a recession, although he acknowledged that its ability to do so depends on factors that are outside its control, such as gas prices, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</span> Many analysts are skeptical that such a “soft landing” is realistic. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">After Mr. Powell’s comments, economists at Deutsche Bank called such hopes “overly optimistic.”
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">Even if the Fed succeeds, however, that doesn’t guarantee a quick recovery for markets.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Inflation is likely to come down only slowly.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Fed officials themselves think it will remain elevated at least through the end of the year.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">The economy, however, could slow relatively quickly.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Europe, which was experiencing slower growth even before Russia invaded Ukraine and has been hit even harder by the spike in energy prices, is particularly vulnerable to such a period of “stagflation” — a portmanteau of the words stagnation and inflation, used to describe periods of high unemployment and rising prices.
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">Analysts say the stock market isn’t likely to regain its footing until there are clear signs that inflation is starting to come under control, which in turn would take pressure off the Fed to raise rates quickly.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Stocks briefly rallied in late May, ending a seven-week losing streak, as data seemed to show that gains in consumer prices had peaked.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">But the selling began again last week after a new report on the Consumer Price Index showed that inflation accelerated again, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumping 8.6 percent</span> in May from a year earlier.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“Not until it is clear that the U.S. has seen peak inflation are concerns about the trajectory of Fed hikes likely to ease significantly,” Jane Foley, a strategist at Rabobank, wrote in an email.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">“Meanwhile, the market sentiment is likely to remain scarred.”
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">The last time the Fed had to raise rates rapidly to control inflation, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it caused what was at the time the worst recession since the Great Depression.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">But economists are optimistic the pain this time won’t be nearly as severe, partly because inflation hasn’t yet become endemic.
</span>Still, Mr. Bryson noted that recessions, once they begin, often prove hard to escape.
<span id=""48"" class=""red"">“Knock on wood you don’t have to go through the same depth of a recession that we did in ’81, ’82 to wring inflation out of the economy today,” he said.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">“The problem though is the stresses of an economic downturn often bring out imbalances that up until that time were largely undetected.”

The dollar has come under fresh pressure after central-bank officials in Europe and Canada last week offered some of their strongest signals yet that they could soon begin winding down monetary policy measures designed to spur economic growth.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Investors, viewing these statements as a sign of strength and a possible portent of higher interest rates in those countries, rushed to buy the currencies.</span> The euro soared to its highest level against the dollar in more than a year, while sterling and the Canadian dollar both rallied more <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2%.</span>

The developments marked the latest bad news for the dollar, now the worst-performing of the major currencies this year.

Few had expected such a turnabout even six months ago. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Investors had driven the dollar to a 14-year-high after the November U.S. presidential election on hopes that Donald Trump’s plans for a tax overhaul, deregulation and fiscal stimulus would accelerate growth while the Federal Reserve also raised interest rates.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Instead, the Trump administration’s plans have repeatedly hit political roadblocks while U.S. growth, employment and inflation data have begun to soften.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Even the Federal Reserve continuing to raise U.S. interest rates—one of the few positives for the dollar this year—is no sure thing.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials recently have expressed concern about pushing up rates amid weakening inflation.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The latest was Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, who said on Thursday that he doesn’t support raising short-term interest rates again this year.

</span>“I think we have been overly hawkish, especially with regard to our future plans,” he told reporters during a London presentation.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Markets are pricing in a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 54% chance</span> that the Fed sticks to its projection for at least one more rate increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span></span> according to fed-funds futures contracts tracked by CME Group.</span> That is down <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 62% in</span> March.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, investors are growing more bullish about economic recoveries in Europe and parts of the developing world, even as they fear a U.S. slowdown.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">After years in which the U.S. economy outpaced growth in the eurozone, the 19-country currency bloc pulled ahead last year, and recent forecasts have its growth essentially even with that of the U.S. this year and next.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Emerging-market economies are expected to expand at the even faster rate <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.7% this</span> year, more than double the pace of U.S. and Europe, according to J.P. Morgan.

</span>“The rest of the world’s tone is improving while the U.S. is decelerating, and the dollar is reflecting that,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Securities.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Some investors believe the dollar’s performance this year could spell the end for the bull market in the greenback.</span> Periods of dollar strength have typically lasted for around seven years.

“We’re at this pivotal moment now where we’re in the midst of a major turn lower in the dollar,” said Bilal Hafeez, head of foreign-exchange strategy for Nomura Securities in London.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Alessio de Longis, a portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds, entered the year betting on a broadly stronger dollar but now expects the dollar to trade sideways this year.

</span>“The growth momentum in the U.S. is fading,” Mr. de Longis said. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">“Without a reinvigoration of tax reform, which doesn’t seem likely this year, the dollar bull market is probably over.”

Hedge funds and other speculative investors built up more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $28 billion</span> in bullish bets on the dollar at the end of last year, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.</span> As of <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 27,</span> bullish bets on the dollar had shrunk to a <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">net $2.7 billion</span>.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Not everyone has lost confidence in a strong dollar: James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, still expects the dollar to rise against developed-market currencies such as the yen in the months ahead.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The dollar has suffered greatly,” said Mr. Athey, who thinks dollar investors are too pessimistic about the Fed’s interest-rate path.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“We think the U.S. economy is still the most robust,” he added.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">A weaker U.S. currency could help support the recent recovery in corporate profits, which grew at the fastest pace in nearly six years in the first quarter of the year.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">A falling dollar makes U.S. multinationals’ exports more competitive abroad.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">A weaker dollar also would relieve pressure on emerging-market nations by making their dollar-denominated debts easier to service and relieving downward pressure on their currencies.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Since many developing countries are also commodities producers, a weaker dollar helps these economies because it makes their materials cheaper for nondollar buyers.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Even in Europe, where exports to the U.S. have become more expensive as a result of the euro’<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.6% rise</span> against the dollar this year, signs of growth slowly picking up could mean European companies are better able to withstand a weakening dollar than in previous years.</span> The benchmark Stoxx <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 600 index</span> has <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rallied 5% this</span> year.

In early November, President Barack Obama ended a trip to South Korea without a much-anticipated free-trade deal—and with the prospects of a broader free-trade agenda sliding rapidly downhill.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last week, a South Korean trade delegation came to Washington and agreed to the deal on terms the Koreans wouldn't even discuss, much less accept, in Seoul.

</span>The rapid change wasn't just startling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It was one of the most important international economic developments in recent years.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The bilateral free-trade agreement with South Korea is both the largest trade deal the U.S. has struck since the North American Free Trade Agreement <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994 and</span> a milestone that had to be reached to foster any hope of crafting a new bipartisan free-trade coalition.

</span>Given the stakes, it's worth asking: What turned the Korea deal around?

Conversations with people involved in the talks, both in Korea and in the U.S., suggest a combination of forces behind the demise and revival. Initially, there were political miscalculations on both sides. At a crucial moment, Mr. Obama made a risky decision to dig in his heels to prove a political point, which seems to have startled the South Koreans into recalculating. The U.S. made a key concession of its own. And the deal got an unexpected boost from the perpetually unpredictable regime in North Korea.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">And in the end, leaders on both sides seem to have decided that the deal's details were less important than making a bold statement about the need for a new global consensus on trade.

</span>The outlines of the U.S.-South Korea deal were struck <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> but the pact had been languishing until earlier this year. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel helped persuade Mr. Obama to dust it off, as much as a national-security move to strengthen ties with Seoul as an economic move.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Mr. Obama set a goal of finishing the pact while world leaders were gathered in Seoul for an economic summit.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The president's labor allies were unhappy, but his real political problem was more specific.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">A trifecta of powerful forces—the United Auto Workers, Ford Motor Co. and the bipartisan leaders of Michigan's congressional delegation—would oppose the treaty's provision calling for an immediate end to the tariff the U.S. imposes on most Korean auto imports.

</span>So while other issues were being resolved, or nearly so, the auto question remained outstanding when Mr. Obama arrived in South Korea, just days after his Democratic Party's devastating losses in midterm congressional elections. U.S. negotiators hoped to finesse the auto issue; they wanted to talk about a three- or four-year delay in ending the tariffs, less than <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 years</span> Ford wanted but maybe enough to close the deal.

They were wrong. The South Koreans appeared to think that Mr. Obama was so weakened by election losses that he would accept almost anything to have a foreign-policy triumph. So they refused to discuss a delay in eliminating tariffs—not <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 years</span>, four or three.

At that point, Mr. Obama decided he needed to demonstrate he wasn't as weakened as imagined. He pulled the plug and left Korea with no deal—merely a promise that South Korea would send negotiators to Washington soon to try again.

He wasn't simply being a tough negotiator. His administration figured that without some give on the tariffs issue, the UAW and the influential bipartisan leaders of the Michigan congressional delegation—Democratic Rep. Sander Levin and Republican Rep. Dave Camp—could block ratification of the deal. He could get a treaty that would die in Congress.

Last week, the South Koreans returned to the table in Washington. But the atmosphere was different. They seemed worried their broader relationship with the U.S. had been put at risk. Moreover, an outside force had intervened to underscore precisely that fear. North Korea had just stunned the world by shelling a South Korean island, one of the most serious provocations since the Korean War. The premium on strong ties to the American superpower had just gone up.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Perhaps more importantly, the South Koreans were surprisingly receptive when U.S. officials argued that, with a deal on auto tariffs, they could deliver broad bipartisan support for an agreement and thereby make a powerful statement about the importance of trade to a global trade system so important to Seoul.

</span>So last Friday, South Korean negotiators agreed to a five-year delay in lifting American auto tariffs—a longer delay than the one they wouldn't even discuss back in Seoul. And they agreed to relax safety standards that had kept American-made cars out of South Korea. In return, the U.S. relented on its push to open Korea to American beef, an issue Korean leaders considered too explosive for concessions.

Now the UAW has actually endorsed the deal, as have the Michigan lawmakers. Many Obama gambles haven't paid off, but the Korean gambit just might.

92101,"<h3>Soda, Motorcycle Prices Rise as Tariffs Hit Home for Consumers</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. manufacturers are charging more to cope with rising steel, aluminum costs

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 31,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 9</span>:11 pm ET

Consumers are starting to see higher prices for recreational vehicles, soda, beer and other goods that now cost more to make as a result of recent tariffs on metals and parts.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">When costs rise, manufacturers generally must chose whether to absorb bigger bills for aluminum, steel and imported components, or pass the increases along to customers.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In recent days many manufacturers, including Coca-Cola Co. and Polaris Industries Inc., have said they plan to raise prices.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">U.S. steel and aluminum prices are <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 33% and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11%,</span> respectively, since the start of the year, as producers and their customers begin to price in the tariffs that the Trump administration first applied on foreign-made metal in March.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Tariffs on a host of additional imported products from China this month have added costs for companies that use those components to assemble their products in the U.S.

“We’ve had to go to the market a bit more frequently and a bit more aggressively with some price increases as of late,” said Michael Happe, chief executive of recreational-vehicle manufacturer</span> Winnebago Industries Inc. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Winnebago wouldn’t say how much it has raised prices, and said it has made changes such as modifying RV floor plans to trim costs.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Forest City, Iowa-based company has benefited from a surge in RV sales in recent years, driven by demand from younger customers, and is spending at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $25 million</span> to expand production.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">But Mr. Happe said the tariffs, broader trade tensions and rising inflation are clouding the outlook for Winnebago.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Uncertainty is never a great thing for the economy and the more noise there is there’s a risk that consumers will press pause,” he said.

</span>U.S. manufacturers have been on a tear. Factory output is <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 22% since</span> a recession low in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2009.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Industrial stocks have climbed this month as companies including 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. reported higher-than-expected sales and profits.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Some of those companies said tariffs were less of a concern than rising labor and shipping costs, and that they would make production changes before raising prices.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">But other executives and investors fear rising costs as a result of the tariffs could sap customer demand and crimp profits.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">And some companies say they believe a strong economy will support higher prices.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“We haven’t seen any pushback on the price,” Todd Bluedorn, chief executive of heating-and-cooling-systems maker Lennox International Inc., said on an investor call last week.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We’ve seen all our competitors announce similar price increases.”

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Consumer prices <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.9% in</span> June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said, the highest rate in more than six years.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Producer prices, a measure of what businesses are paid for goods and services, have also climbed to the highest level in years.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The producer-price index <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.4% in</span> June from a year earlier as energy and shipping costs climbed along with metal prices.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Polaris is raising prices on its boats, motorcycles, snowmobiles and other recreational vehicles to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cover $15 million</span> of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $40 million</span> in tariff-related costs the Minnesota-based manufacturer expects to pay for foreign-made steel, aluminum and components from China this year.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Polaris is also facing retaliatory tariffs from other countries on products it exports from the U.S., including the Indian-brand motorcycles it ships to Europe.

</span>Chief Executive Scott Wine said Polaris would accelerate plans to move production of motorcycles that it sells in Europe to Poland from Iowa to avoid rising European Union tariffs on U.S. motorcycles.

Harley-Davidson Inc. announced a similar plan in June, drawing condemnation from unions representing its U.S. workers and from President Trump. Mr. Trump said Harley was undermining its Made-in-America legacy.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Harley’s Chief Executive Matt Levatich last Tuesday said the move would keep down the cost of its motorcycles in Europe.</span> “We made the best decision given the circumstances,” he said.

Tariff costs are starting to hit consumers at the grocery store as well. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Coke on Wednesday said it was taking the unusual step of raising soda prices midyear in North America because of rising costs, including freight rates as well as prices for plastic and aluminum.

</span>“Clearly it’s disruptive for us. It’s disruptive for our customers,” CEO James Quincey said on a call with analysts. He said he expected distributors and retailers to pass along the increases to consumers starting in the third quarter.

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Executives at Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer Co. said they would raise prices up <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2% in</span> the second half of the year.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“At some point, increased commodity costs have to be passed through to some extent,” Chairman Jim Koch said on an earnings call Thursday.

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Manufacturers have some room to increase prices as the U.S. economy continues to grow at a robust pace, driven by strong consumer spending and exports.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Gross domestic product rose at <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.1% rate</span> in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Strong demand for heating and ventilation equipment is helping manufacturers in that sector recoup most of the added costs that have resulted from the steel and aluminum tariffs.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Manufacturers of such equipment have succeeded before at raising prices to cover—and even profit from—higher commodity costs, said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies & Co.

Lennox, one manufacturer of such equipment, has raised prices to cover higher costs and plans a second round to cover the <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $50 million</span> the Richardson, Texas, company expects to spend on steel this year.</span> Lennox said it also expects to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $20 million</span> more for freight <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $5 million</span> for tariffs on components such as motors from China this year.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Office furniture maker Steelcase Inc. also raised prices in June for the second time in four months as steel prices climbed.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">“It’s been a long time, if ever, that we’ve done two price increases back to back as quickly as we did,” Chief Executive James P.

46180,"<h3>Cities Try to Lure Young Professionals With Cheap 'Micro' Units</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Officials in many of the nation's most expensive housing markets have embraced 'micro apartments'

Updated Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 3</span>:20 pm ET

In recent years, officials in many of the nation's most expensive housing markets have embraced ""micro apartments"" as a way to provide less-expensive housing for young renters.

</span>They are betting that the tiny apartments—generally the size of a hotel room for about half the rent of a full-size apartment—will attract young professionals and recent college graduates, helping to revitalize city centers.

Micro apartments are <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 300 square</span> feet or smaller, though some developers and cities define them as large <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 500 square</span> feet. They sometimes lack a separate kitchen or bedroom.

Developers believe that single people in their 20s and 30s will accept less space in exchange for lower rent, even in cities where rent levels aren't especially lofty. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationwide, rents have soared as the supply of apartments hasn't kept pace with demand.

</span>Census figures show that single-person households made up <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 27.8% of</span> all U.S. households <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 25.8% in</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2000.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While the elderly account for some of the growth, economists and demographers also attribute it to Generation Y, the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 80 million</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Americans 18 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34 years</span> old.

</span>""This is not a short-term phenomenon,"" said John Infranca, an assistant law professor at Suffolk University in Boston who specializes in land-use law and has studied micro-apartment projects in several cities. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">""There is going to be demand for this housing going forward.</span> The [trend] of an increasing number of singles in cities is staying steady across the country.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""

In Cleveland's University Circle district, an employment and cultural hub five miles east of downtown, developer Coral Co. plans to start construction next year <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 50 micro</span> apartments as part of a large, mixed-use project.</span> The 300-square-foot units will rent <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $600 a</span> month, compared to the area's typical range <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $800 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,500 for</span> one-bedroom apartments. Target renters are graduate students and medical residents, including those at the nearby Cleveland Clinic.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">In downtown Providence, the 185-year-old Arcade retail building was converted this year <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 48 micro</span> apartments.</span> In Worcester, Mass., a newly built complex <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 55 micro</span> apartments has leased more than two-thirds of its units, including to students at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""We're trying to encourage more residential development downtown for college students and professionals,"" said Paul D. Morano Jr., director of business assistance for Worcester, a city <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 181,000 people</span>.

</span>Micro apartments started gaining popularity decades ago in large cities coping with rising rents, including New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C. The complexes often have communal spaces such as large lobbies and restaurants where tenants can socialize. Developers reason that many young tenants would prefer communal space to personal space and would rather spend money socializing than on rent.

A national tally of micro apartments couldn't be found.

Some real-estate executives aren't sure that micro apartments would work in smaller or less expensive cities because rents aren't sufficiently high to induce enough renters to give up space. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""In smaller markets, the rent differential is such that, if you have a good job, you can typically afford the rent of a...full-size apartment,"" said Jeffrey I. Friedman, chief executive of Associated Estates Realty Corp., which <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 14,000 apartments</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaging 975 square</span> feet <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Midwestern</span> and East Coast states.

</span>Another potential problem for smaller cities is that they don't always have the mass transit, night life and cultural facilities to lure younger workers to live downtown. ""You can't just drop these [micro apartments] in communities that don't have the amenities to serve that kind of lifestyle,"" said Kelly Saito, president of Gerding Edlen, the developer of the first of Boston's new wave of micro apartments.

Developer Evan Granoff, who owns the Arcade in Providence, has found that some renters are commuters using the units as second homes. ""They're people who have a 45-minute to one-hour commute to work and want to have a place downtown,"" Mr. Granoff says. ""It's people looking for party crash pads. The rents are pretty reasonable, so it's an attractive alternative to staying in a hotel.""

Scott Christensen, a 51-year-old information-technology director, frequently commutes between Chicago, where his wife and three children live, and Providence, where he works at a law firm. He plans to move this month into one of the 225-square-foot apartments that Mr. Granoff is offering starting <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $550 a</span> month.

""I'm kind of the perfect tenant,"" Mr. Christensen said. ""I won't be in the micro unit all of the time because I travel. While I'll cook some, I'll be in the restaurants downtown constantly.""

In March, 25-year-old entrepreneur Ross Chanowski moved into a 464-square-foot apartment in Boston. The unit is large enough for his queen bed, a short couch, a flat-screen TV and a table that doubles as a desk.

""What you don't get in space... you get in the co-living space in the lobby"" or on the rooftop patio, Mr. Chanowski said. ""If you're the type who likes to be in your apartment all the time, this probably isn't the lifestyle for you.""

92673,"<h3>Federal Prosecutors Start Sex-Crimes Investigation Into Harvey Weinstein</h3>Probe comes amid frustration among some law-enforcement officials that local prosecutors haven’t brought charges

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 24,</span></span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 12</span>:17 am ET

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have launched a criminal probe into sex-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, said people familiar with the matter, escalating law-enforcement scrutiny of the former Hollywood producer.

One issue in the investigation is whether Mr. Weinstein lured or induced any women to travel across state lines for the purpose of committing a sex crime, an offense that could allow for federal charges, some people familiar with the investigation said. The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York is leading the inquiry.

Some law-enforcement authorities have expressed frustration that local prosecutors haven’t brought criminal charges against Mr. Weinstein. The veteran Hollywood producer faces sexual-harassment accusations from dozens of women, including allegations of rape and sexual assault.

Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he has met with federal prosecutors in Manhattan “in an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding” and will continue to meet with them in the coming weeks.

“Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual sexual acts,” he said.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Manhattan federal prosecutors had already been investigating possible fraud connected to financial transactions arranged by Mr. Weinstein for a charity auction, but the broadening of the probe to include possible sex crimes occurred in recent months, some of the people familiar with the matter said.

</span>It is rare for federal prosecutors to review individual sexual assault allegations, which are typically handled by local authorities, according to legal experts. Federal sex crimes charges are more commonly used in sex-trafficking and child-exploitation cases.

Local authorities in Manhattan and Los Angeles have opened investigations into Mr. Weinstein since media reports in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017 detailed</span> several instances of sexual harassment by him.

The federal investigation into Mr. Weinstein is happening as the continuing probe by local authorities in New York has been marked by tensions between police and the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

“How much longer can they let it linger?” said Michael Bock, who investigated Mr. Weinstein as a supervisor for the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Division before retiring last year. “We believe he should be arrested.”

Two NYPD officials said the NYPD is prepared to arrest Mr. Weinstein and is awaiting the green light from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., whose office has been criticized by some law-enforcement officials and women’s groups for its decision not to charge Mr. Weinstein <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span> a sexual-assault allegation brought against him by an Italian model.

In response to criticism over Mr. Vance’s handling of <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 case</span>, Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance’s office, said in March: “Police evaluate arrests based on probable cause, whereas prosecutors must make sure they can prove to a jury that every element of a criminal statute was violated beyond a reasonable doubt—a much higher standard.”

In March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the New York attorney general to review how Mr. Vance’s office and the NYPD handled <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 investigation</span>. Mr. Vance, in a letter to the governor, called the review “an unwarranted intrusion by an elected executive into a charging decision by an independent prosecutor.”

Mr. Frost said this week that the district attorney’s current investigation into Mr. Weinstein is in “an advanced stage.”

As part of the investigation, the NYPD reviewed a rape allegation by actress Paz de la Huerta, according to people familiar with the investigation. Ms. de la Huerta has accused Mr. Weinstein of forcing himself on her in her Tribeca apartment <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> She said it wasn’t consensual.

Mr. Weinstein has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.

The sex-crimes investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan is separate and independent from the inquiry by Mr. Vance’s office, people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear which allegations the U.S. attorney’s office is reviewing.

To charge Mr. Weinstein with a federal sex crime, prosecutors face a high bar. They would likely have to show interstate activity, such as evidence that Mr. Weinstein enticed a woman to cross state lines under false pretenses with the intention of committing a sex crime against her, legal experts said.

Sex-crime cases are among the toughest for both state and federal prosecutors to prove, former prosecutors said, as the victims’ recollection and credibility can be impacted by the trauma of the incident.

“Often, there isn’t a contemporaneous record of the assault taking place,” said Jeffrey Brown, who oversaw sex-crimes investigations as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and is now in private practice. “In any prosecution, the lack of that kind of corroborating evidence can make the victim’s in-court testimony vulnerable to challenge.”

In one advantage for federal prosecutors, federal rules of evidence are more expansive in allowing proof of other sexual assaults to show a defendant’s propensity for a sex crime.

The limited ability to do that at the state level played out during the first sexual-assault trial against entertainer Bill Cosby, which ended in a mistrial after a judge allowed prosecutors to call two women to testify that they had been assaulted by Mr. Cosby. Prosecutors had sought to have more than a dozen women take the stand.

Mr. Cosby was convicted last month after a second trial, where six accusers were allowed to testify. Mr. Cosby’s lawyer has said he plans to appeal.

Appeared in the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 24,</span></span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> print edition as 'Weinstein Faces U.S. Sex-Crime Inquiry'."
41744,"<h3>Hints of Normalcy in Katmandu, but Rebuilding Lies Ahead</h3>KATMANDU — After spending eight days living in a tent in this city’s Tudikhel Park, Bikesh Karki and his family decided, like tens of thousands of others, to pack up and go home.
“We’re going to have a party tonight,” said Bikesh,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span> who was carrying two trash bags full of belongings. “Nothing too big. Just a nice dinner with family.”
A week after the most severe earthquake in more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 years</span>, Katmandu returned to a semblance of normalcy Saturday as a growing number of its residents packed up tents, checked out of hospitals and got ready for the workweek, which starts on Sunday. Many shops that survived the quake were open; electricity was largely restored; and with truck traffic moving, hotel restaurants were once again serving fresh fruit. Lines disappeared from gas stations.
The weather even got back to normal after rains and chilly temperatures that made life especially miserable for survivors gave way to the season’s usual warmth and brilliant sunshine.
While Katmandu has managed a remarkable turnaround over the past week, a full recovery in impoverished Nepal is expected to take billions of dollars and years of efforts, especially in the hard-hit hinterlands. Rather than folding up their tents, Nepalis in those remote villages are still trying to acquire them to temporarily replace tens of thousands of destroyed homes.
“We are struggling to provide tents as we have to purchase them from abroad,” said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a Home Ministry spokesman.
The relatively quick move toward recovery in Katmandu, the capital, was possible in part because the city’s airport was able to mostly stay open throughout the crisis, a huge stroke of luck. Relief supplies poured into the airport from abroad and have been piled in huge pallets around runways and airport buildings. Supplies were quickly ferried into the city, but stormy weather, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic roadblocks prevented them from rapidly reaching rural areas.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Even so, the cleanup of many dozens of toppled buildings in Katmandu and the search for new housing will take time.</span> But many residents seemed determined to at least begin to move on. By Saturday, the city’s always unruly traffic seemed to take in stride the various detours around piles of bricks and timber from shattered buildings.
A week ago, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 150,000 people</span> were living cheek by jowl in hastily constructed tents in Tudikhel Park; that number had dropped <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10,000 by</span> Saturday, according to Dal Bahadur Khatri, the head constable for the area. Teenagers were once again kicking soccer balls around grassy areas now dotted with blackened circles where thousands of families had recently been cooking meals.
Bikesh, the 17-year-old heading home, said he was looking forward to watching a bit of TV and trying to find his cat, which had given birth just before the earthquake.
“I just want to have my stuff,” he said.
The fear of more earthquakes has not left this city, with many admitting that nightly aftershocks — always accompanied by a symphony of howls from thousands of stray dogs — still robbed them of sleep. But Tara Magar,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> said on Saturday that she was moving home because she could not stand the smell of the park’s toilets anymore.
“I’m still scared, and our house still has cracks all over it,” she said, “but we don’t want to stay here any longer.”
At nearby Bir Hospital, a 660-bed facility that was overrun with hundreds of trauma patients in the hours after the earthquake, doctors said <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 40 new</span> patients sought attention Saturday, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20 of</span> whom had serious medical problems.
“We’re almost back to normal operations,” said Dr. Swoyam Pandit, the hospital director. The hospital, a sprawling complex of new and older buildings, suffered some structural damage to its oldest sections. But Dr. Pandit said he expected that to be fixed soon. And the hospital’<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 150 administrative</span> staff members, many of whom left the city for their home villages over the past week, are being asked to return to work Sunday, he said.
“I expect nearly all of them will be back,” Dr. Pandit said.
The nationwide death toll on Saturday stood at more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6,600,</span> though many fear it will keep rising as more villages are reached.
In Thamel, a haven in Katmandu for backpackers, trekking and curio shops were mostly open, although the usual bustling crowd of young and tattooed tourists was largely absent. In their stead, crews of burly, tired-looking rescue workers wandered through after hopes of finding anyone alive in the rubble had largely disappeared.
At Hotel Traveler’s Home, a no-star hotel <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whose 17 rooms</span> were fully occupied when the earthquake struck, only three guests were checked in, said Damodar Dhaka, the co-owner.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“This is normally our high season, and before the earthquake, business was fantastic,” Mr. Dhaka said.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eight of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 13 employees</span> returned to their villages shortly after the quake, but Mr. Dhaka said he hoped they would return soon.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As for more tourists, he said he expected business would not pick up again for six months.
</span>At a massage parlor, two women with bright red lipstick were waiting for customers up four flights of creaky stairs. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Chandra Kala Karki, the owner, said she had been negotiating a price with a customer when the earthquake struck, and the man pulled her under a table during the shaking.</span> When the quake stopped, he took her and the rest of the staff to a park nearby for safety.
Ms. Karki said she reopened Thursday but had received only four customers since.
“Everyone is still scared, but we’re here because we have to be,” she said. “I don’t know how I’m going to afford the rent this month.”

Ms. Trandafir had been volunteering at an orphanage when the quake struck. Her duties had been to take the orphanage’<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 25 children</span> to school and help them with their homework. But the school was badly damaged and probably not open for some time, so Ms. Trandafir left, she said. Saturday was her birthday, so she decided to get a tattoo to memorialize an extraordinary week.
“I’m still a little freaked out,” Ms. Trandafir said. “But I survived, so I want a tattoo.”
This is the peak of Nepal’s wedding season, but many of the city’s most popular wedding venues remained closed. Several owners said that with so many funerals being held in remote villages, no one wanted to get married. But they said a few ceremonies were expected this week and more by next weekend.
Deepti Koirala and Arpan Pokharel had intended to marry on Monday at the Party Palace, a large wedding venue in the city. But the ceremony was canceled after the earthquake, so they got married on Thursday at home with <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 75 guests</span> instead of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 500 they</span> had originally planned. The two fell in love four months ago and did not want to wait any longer, Ms. Koirala said.
“Obviously, we cannot stop such natural disasters, but we have to dare to overcome them once they happen. We have to move on,” she said. “People are trying to make life normal again.”"

John Williams, a Ph.D. economist and Federal Reserve lifer, made his mark inside the central bank with his deep knowledge of interest-rate theory and a solid record as a policy maker and communicator.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">When Mr. Williams won a big promotion to Federal Reserve Bank of New York president last year, senior officials didn’t see his lack of financial-markets experience as a liability.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He was so new to the markets side of the job that, in his first month in New York, he received an hourlong tutorial on using a Bloomberg data terminal, Wall Street’s ubiquitous trading-desk tool.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Now his market savvy is being put to the test.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">After years of calm, the New York Fed is tamping down an unexpected bout of turbulence in money markets that caught officials and investors off guard this month.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">A sudden shortage of cash caused interest rates to spike unexpectedly on very short-term loans banks make to each other overnight, called repurchase or “repo” agreements.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Fed’s response, flooding the system with temporary funding, soothed markets.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But some economists and financial analysts say the Fed was caught flat-footed and slow to respond to dysfunction that threatened to jam the transmission of central-bank policy decisions to the broader economy.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“There is a serious question about why they didn’t foresee it,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at investment-advisory firm PGIM Fixed Income, who previously held senior Fed and Treasury Department posts.</span> “Why were they surprised? What did they miss? <span id=""9"" class=""red"">And was that a reflection of something not happening at the New York Fed on the desk or elsewhere?”
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In an interview, Mr. Williams rejected the idea that the central bank was behind the curve in responding to the market volatility.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The New York Fed followed a “consistent approach of assessment, coming up very quickly with an appropriate plan, and executing that,” he said.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“This is really the Fed at its best.”
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The Fed’s approach will be tested Monday, when the third quarter ends and banks may refrain from overnight lending in order to show strong balance sheets.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Reduced lending could put pressure on the repo market and create more volatility.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The New York Fed said it plans to keep injecting funds through Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 and</span> has increased the sizes of these injections in recent days.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Williams and his colleagues must also solve the mystery behind the money-market dysfunction: Why did banks, seemingly flush with reserves, choose not to lend as rising repo rates created a quick profit opportunity?</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Officials are studying the role of new regulations and other postcrisis market structure issues.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Regardless of the cause, such volatility isn’t good—in stressed conditions, it could force hedge funds and others that rely heavily on short-term loans to dump assets, disrupting markets and impairing the flow of credit to the economy.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The New York Fed, in a castle-like fortress two blocks from Wall Street, serves as the central bank’s nexus between the financial markets and the economy.</span> It provides the U.S. government’s real-time eyes and ears on trillions of dollars that flow through global markets daily. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Its staff played critical roles designing rescue programs and monitoring banks when broken credit markets sent the financial system to the brink of collapse <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2007 and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2009.</span>

Funding pressure
This month’s trouble bubbled up Monday, Sept.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Mr. Williams and Lorie Logan, the executive who is interim manager of the Fed’s portfolio, had traveled to Washington with other senior staffers ahead of the central bank’s two-day rate-setting policy meeting.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Potential for funding pressures in money markets had been building for months due to regulatory changes, rising Treasury bond issuance and steady declines in deposits banks hold at the Fed—known as reserves—the result of the Fed’<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2017 decision</span> to shrink its balance sheet.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Fed had been surveying banks for months about their demand for reserves but didn’t think they were near this point that would lead to funding pressures.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Officials knew some large payments of corporate taxes and Treasury auction settlements on Sept.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16 would</span> result in a large transfer of cash from banks to the government.</span> But they believed money markets could digest them because similar payment dates in April and June hadn’t roiled markets.
A cash crunch began building that afternoon in repo rates. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">This year, rates on repurchase agreements usually have been no more than a 10th of a percentage point above the effective fed-funds rate, or <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2.2% in</span> August and early September.</span> They <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 5% on</span> Sept.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span></span>
Pressure intensified when repo desks began rolling over loans early Tuesday, Sept.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span> with the repo rate rising as high <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10%.</span> Even then banks refused to lend, passing up big profits to hold on to their cash.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">The dysfunction led the Fed’s benchmark federal-funds rate to rise <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.3</span>%—above its 2%-to-2.25% target range—going outside of the target range for the first time since the central bank began setting a range during <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 crisis</span>.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">From temporary offices at Fed headquarters in Washington, Mr. Williams, Ms. Logan and their team assessed what was roiling markets and what operations were needed to restore liquidity.</span> They decided to <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inject $75 billion</span> in cash into money markets, the first such move since the crisis.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">Share Your Thoughts
Does this month’s repo-market crunch worry you?</span> Join the conversation below.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">Traders didn’t hear anything from the Fed until 9:15 that morning, several hours after rates began spiking, minutes before the U.S. stock market opened and an hour before the Fed’s policy meeting would start.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“Market confidence in the New York Fed markets desk is critical, and a series of events here have, let’s say, dinged confidence in the operations,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at financial-services company Jefferies LLC.</span> “It’s important that the confidence issue be addressed before it becomes a more significant problem.”
Mr. Williams in the interview defended the bank’s response, saying, “We diagnosed it right, and Lorie and her team worked with others to get that done and get it done quickly.”
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Some analysts said that the Fed ultimately made the right calls but that the incident showed officials had miscalculated the quantity of reserves needed in the system and how tight funding markets would get as a result.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“The lack of response on Monday was unnerving,” said Mark Cabana, head of short-term interest-rate strategy research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span> “They came in on Tuesday, but they came in too late.”
Leadership void
Mr. Williams’s team was making its moves without key leadership after he ousted two veterans. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">In late May, Mr. Williams announced the departure of Simon Potter, head of the markets desk <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2012,</span> and Richard Dzina, head of financial services.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">They had joined the New York Fed <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1991,</span> respectively.</span> People familiar with the matter said the exits had less to do with particular policy disputes than with tension over day-to-day management issues.
The way Mr. Williams executed the abrupt departures rattled upper management and sank staff morale, current and former staffers said. Mr. Potter learned of the decision from Mr. Williams shortly before he was to deliver a keynote address in Hong Kong that had already been announced.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">At a going-away party at the New York Fed’s headquarters, Messrs. Potter and Dzina received an extended ovation that kept Mr. Williams waiting offstage to address attendees.</span> “It was maybe three minutes,” said one attendee. “It is hard to describe how awkward the air felt.”
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York Fed said Mr. Williams planned to break the top job of overseeing markets into two positions—one to oversee the central bank’s securities portfolio and open-market operations, and to implement monetary-policy decisions; and the other to handle markets group operations and technology.
</span>Mr. Williams, in the interview, said the leadership vacancies were “in no way interfering with the work we’re doing, and our ability to do our very best.”
Mr. Williams himself had previously roiled markets, unintentionally, in a <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18 public</span> speech on the eve of the central bank’s quiet period before its July policy meeting. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">He expounded <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 20 years</span> of research that called for more aggressive and pre-emptive action to shore up the economy at any sign of weakness.
</span>He had delivered similar comments before. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">But the context of these remarks—from a top lieutenant to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell just before the Fed’s first rate cut in a decade—led markets to change their expectations about what the Fed would do.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Markets began anticipating the Fed would cut interest rates by a half-percentage-point, instead of a quarter point, at the July 30-31 meeting.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">Hours later, the New York Fed issued a rare clarification that markets had misunderstood the speech.</span> Mr. Williams hadn’t meant to send a signal about the size of the coming rate cut.
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Mr. Williams and Mr. Powell must now lead their colleagues through a series of decisions, including:
• when to let the Fed’s asset portfolio begin growing again;
• whether to add additional reserves, which would require larger purchases of Treasurys;
• what mix of Treasury securities to add;
• whether to replace the Fed’s benchmark rate with something more widely traded;
• whether to launch a new tool that could alleviate cash crunches without daily ad hoc injections, and how to design it.
</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">“Where the Fed left itself vulnerable,” said Jim Vogel, a rates strategist at fixed-income broker FTN Financial, “was to postpone all of those decisions, and to do it so publicly.”

In a dictatorship, the only crime is opposing the regime
A lot is happening in the news. Here's one item that we noticed: Canada canceled democracy last night. And the remarkable thing is no one in this country seemed to notice that it happened. There was no outcry from our political class, as their friend Justin Trudeau declared martial law in response to an entirely peaceful protest from his country's working class.
Our news media barely noted that it happened. Weirdest of all, the State Department, which exists these days to denounce such attackers of democracy as Hungary and Poland, didn't say a single word as democracy in Canada ended. That's pretty weird, if you think about it.
HOW TO WATCH FOX NEWS CHANNEL IN CANADA
Canada is not some exotic, faraway land with an alien culture and unintelligible language. It's not Ukraine. Canada is our neighbor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It's our trading partner.</span> Canada is our closest ally on Earth. It's frankly part of our country. Our vice president grew up in Canada, so did half of our comedians and actors and singers. Our border with Canada is the longest border in the world. It stretches more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,500 miles</span>. So on every level, we are deeply intertwined with Canada, whether we notice it or not.
CANADIAN CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUPS RESPOND TO TRUDEAU INVOKING EMERGENCIES ACT
What happens there matters here. If nothing else, it's a preview of what will likely happen in the United States. So with that in mind, you should know that Justin Trudeau is no longer the prime minister of Canada. Justin Trudeau is Canada's maximum leader, its strongman, its potentate. Justin Trudeau is the dictator of Canada. If you think that's an overstatement, try to think of another way to describe what Justin Trudeau is now doing.
For the first time in Canada's history, Trudeau has invoked what's known as the Emergencies Act, but the protests he is facing hardly qualify as an emergency. But suddenly, Justin Trudeau has the power to crush all political opposition to his rule, and that's exactly what he's doing. Trudeau has ended free speech in Canada. He's banned free assembly. Trudeau's government has shut down political rallies and arrested his political critics without probable cause. Trudeau has instituted internal passports, that restrict travel within Canada, to the politically obedient. Canadians are no longer allowed to leave their own country unless they obey Justin Trudeau. And if they don't obey, they could be bankrupted and destroyed. He now has the power to do that. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Trudeau has claimed the power to freeze the financial assets of any Canadian who resists him.</span> No court order is required to do this, he just decides.
Justin Trudeau can even dictate what you do for a living and how you do it. Today, Trudeau threatened to arrest tow truck drivers who refused to tow the trucks of protesters. Is this really about stopping the spread of coronavirus? No one in Canada is even pretending that it is anymore. Trudeau himself didn't mention the risk of COVID a single time yesterday. He's not worried about unvaccinated truckers spreading a virus. Trudeau is worried about Canadians resisting his rule. And that's why Trudeau's government announced yesterday they plan to regulate cryptocurrency forever. Watch.
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: <span id=""2"" class=""red"">We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules, so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.</span> These changes cover all forms of transactions including digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Oh, the Terrorist Financing Act.</span> So that was a law passed to defeat Al Qaeda. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Now it's being used to stop law-abiding Canadians, middle-class people, students, truck drivers, from protecting their earnings from the total mismanagement of Canada's Central Bank.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Justin Trudeau has wrecked the Canadian economy; but thanks to the Terrorist Financing Act, there is no escape from the consequences.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Canadians are going to have to live with the consequences of Justin Trudeau's fiscal recklessness, whether they want to or not.</span> Otherwise, they're terrorists.
‘HE JUST GAINED MORE FREEDOM FIGHTERS’: TRUCKERS REACT TO TRUDEAU INVOKING EMERGENCIES ACT
It shouldn't surprise you that Trudeau's first move in the face of a trucker protest was to clamp down on cryptocurrency. Democrats will try this in this country, guaranteed. They'll tell us Bitcoin is a Russian plot, CNN will dutifully back them up. Watch it happen. But at the same time, you've got to wonder, since we're speaking of terrorism, what happened to the actual terrorists? Those do exist. How is Justin Trudeau treating them? Well, let's see. A few years ago, Justin Trudeau gave more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in taxpayer money in a settlement to a self-described Al Qaeda soldier called Omar Khadr. Khadr murdered a U.S. Army sergeant.
Now murdering a U.S. Army sergeant is bad, but it's not as bad as criticizing Justin Trudeau. So Trudeau did not freeze Khadr's bank account. Instead, he just made him rich and moved on. When anti-Christian arsonists burned more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 Catholic</span> churches across Canada, Justin Trudeau did not declare an emergency. Instead, he issued a statement sympathizing with them, ""It is fully understandable,"" Trudeau said, ""Given the shameful history we all becoming more aware of.""
Are you beginning to see how this works? In a dictatorship, the only real crime is opposing the regime. So how did all this happen so quickly in a country as nice and moderate as Canada? Well it happened the way that it always happened. It happened with maximum aggression and limited popular support. Justin Trudeau won reelection last year with less than a third of the national vote. In fact, he finished the election behind his main competitor, the Conservative Party. Thanks to quirks in the parliamentary system, Trudeau took power anyway, and he immediately began to crack down on anyone who opposed him. Trudeau had relatively few supporters, but they turned out to be the right supporters. They were the people with power.
The woman, for example, you just saw announcing the crackdown on cryptocurrency is Canada's deputy prime minister. But before she was that, she was a long-time journalist, including in our country. She used to write for The Washington Post. She's currently married to a New York Times reporter. Why is that relevant? Well, because up and down this story, you see the starring role that media organizations have played in the death of Canadian democracy. The other day, for example, somebody hacked the database of the crowdfunding website Give Fund Go, and then revealed the names of people who donated to the truckers protesting in Ottawa. You've got to ask yourself who would have the tech savvy and the political motive to do something like that? Well, state intelligence agencies would. In fact, we can't really think of anybody else. It would certainly be interesting to find out who did it. It's a big part of the story. But media companies seem curiously uninterested in finding out who did it. Instead, they immediately started using this stolen information to intimidate the donors.
Anyone who dared to send money to Justin Trudeau's political opponents was unmasked in public, shamed, and of course, inevitably threatened. Because that's what happens. Trudeau's state TV channel, the CBC, has been working on this retribution project all day long. They knew who their enemies are, and they knew who their master is. It's Justin Trudeau. But Canada's National Post newspaper is doing the same thing. The National Post is supposedly independent of the government, but they're still doing it. In this country, Vice Media, to its great and eternal shame, has been doing the same thing.
So what do all of these media companies have in common? Well, they're all squarely on the side of entrenched power against the population they supposedly serve. That's the opposite of what journalism was designed to do. But at this point, it is the rule. Not just in the United States, but around the world. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Reporters and politicians and big business all align against voters, against you.</span> Have you noticed? Earlier this week, the CBC warned Canadians that the word freedom has ""become common among far-right groups."" So only QAnon wants freedom. Remember that the next time you complain about Justin Trudeau.
CANADIAN TRUCKERS: LIVE UPDATES
Media organizations have been agitating against democracy for years now, even as they've posed loudly as its greatest defenders. In February <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span></span> at the beginning of the pandemic, Vice Media ran this headline: ""Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government will 'enforce' a vaccine for coronavirus."" ""Anti-vax groups on social media are claiming that the spread of the disease will lead to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance."" Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. Now that all of that has actually happened, Vice has not apologized, instead Vice is helping Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about him.
In October of that same year,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> the CBC warned Canadians about a ""disinformation campaign [that] falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent to quarantine sites."" A few months later, as if on cue, the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians to quarantine sites. But the CBC never apologized for posting what turned out to be disinformation. Instead, they set about enforcing Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They see that as their job.</span> So by the way, this is the so-called academic community. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">These are the university professors who've been granted lifetime job security, precisely so they can think for themselves.</span> Freely, independent from government control. And yet, in practice, no one is more controlled by the government than they are. Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University — that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau — telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. Watch.
PROFESSOR: I think it's important to remember that at the core of this protest, you know, it was never really about mandates in the first place. It's always been about a small group of people who called for a convoy, who hold very anti-government views, as well as kind of a racist and white supremacist views, conspiratorial world views.
Oh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. But isn't holding anti-government views allowed in a democracy? In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government the degree to which you're allowed to question the people in charge? Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. Yes, it is indeed a scary problem when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau — arrest them. On MSNBC, which is less subtle, but a lot more straightforward most of the time, they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures; the problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. Time to get the stick and start hurting people.
JOE SCARBOROUGH: I do have to ask one question, though the liberal prime minister in Canada. Seriously? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, if I'm a mayor or I'm a prime minister, your trucks get in my city street? They're not going to stay there a week. No, no, no, no. They're not going to stay, there's going to be somebody with a stick and it's going to be banging on the window. It's going to say, you got one or two options in this thing. Are we going to cuff you and take you to jail and we're going to pound this and we're going to find your company. Move it or lose it.
Settle down, tough guy. There's going to be someone there with a stick. It's interesting. It's always the very same people who call for violence. It's almost like it excites them. It's not a good sign. So clearly there is an appetite for Canadian-style tyranny in this country, and the question is how long til we get it? Let's see.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies are trying to censor a financial website called ZeroHedge.</span> Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community told The Associated Press, off-the-record of course, that ZeroHedge was, ""spreading Russian propaganda,"" by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. We can't have that. So how long before they pull ZeroHedge off the internet? How long before they try the same thing with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media? All of whom, we can tell you firsthand, have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin.

And when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, what will we call it then? CNN will, of course, describe it as a necessary national security measure. But it's not that. It's tyranny. And by the way, since when does the CIA get to decide what websites Americans read? Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? Old-fashioned liberals, anyone? What do they think of this? Maybe they don't notice it. In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. They don't look very threatening. They're not the Hollywood version of fascist. Look at Justin Trudeau. He's absurd. The '70s haircut, all those little outfits when he feels like playing dress-up. He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous.
But maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. Instead, they promote color revolutions and control foreign governments from afar. That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, which became a far more repressive place once Joe Biden began running it, and he does run Ukraine. Make no mistake. That's what they do. This new class of dictators seizes power incrementally, through the bureaucracy. They never raise their voices. They don't wave their arms. They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy and public health. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity.</span> They're entirely passive-aggressive. But they're no less dangerous. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job and seized your bank account for the crime of disagreeing with them.</span> This is the architecture of tyranny, and it's not just happening in Canada. It's happening here in the United States. It will be used against us. Bet on it.

The room broke up in laughter: It was clear the vice president hadn’t come with a briefcase of cash to pay off Greece’s debts. But his joke captured a deeper truth — <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> many still viewed the United States as the ultimate guarantor of the international order. And Mr. Biden clearly saw himself as a steward of that legacy, his easy self-confidence the product of four decades as a globe-trotting senator.
As Mr. Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday, vowing to “repair our alliances and engage with the world once more,” the question for many overseas is whether they will see this man of the world anytime soon.
In capitals from Europe to Asia, diplomats and foreign-policy experts have questioned whether the United States is too divided, too weakened and too preoccupied by internal convulsions to play the kind of leadership role that Mr. Biden took for granted as a senator and vice president.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet there are reasons to believe President Biden will be more visible and activist than many expect, even as he grapples with the pandemic, a massive economic recovery effort, and the deep divisions left by the Trump era.</span> From the people he has chosen for key foreign policy posts to the travel opportunities he has this year, those who know Mr. Biden say he is unlikely to stay off the global stage for long.
“This is a guy who <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 40 years</span> getting to know foreign leaders around the world,” said Peter Westmacott, who lived next door to Mr. Biden as British ambassador to Washington during the Obama administration. “Once you’ve got a flavor for international relationships, you don’t turn your back on all that.”
Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States, said he expected Mr. Biden to draw on his personal relationships to mend bonds with European allies that had been sundered by former President Donald J. Trump.
“Joe Biden is a master of networking, and he will easily repair the lack of trust,” said Mr. Ischinger, who now runs the Munich Security Forum.

Mr. Ischinger’s immediate goal is to persuade the president to attend his influential annual conference. He has a decent chance of landing him: Mr. Biden has been a staple in Munich for years, most memorably <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> when he announced that President Barack Obama wanted to hit the “reset button” with Russia.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Biden said the “world is watching.” He promised that the United States had “come out stronger” from its recent stress test. And he pledged a restoration of American leadership in which, he said, “we’ll lead, not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.”
Mr. Biden is likely to make his formal debut at a meeting of Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 leaders</span> in June, which Britain is hosting at a seaside resort in Cornwall. He may expand that trip to include other European destinations, including Germany, where he could bid farewell to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she steps down <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 16 years</span>.
In the fall, Mr. Biden is expected to attend a Group <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 meeting</span> in Rome and the United Nations’ climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where he could showcase his decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord.
Beyond dates in the diplomatic diary, experts contend that Mr. Biden’s appointments do not suggest an inward-looking White House.
His choice of Kurt M. Campbell to serve as a high-level coordinator of Asia policy, for example, could foretell a tough line with China coupled with an energetic effort to reassure American allies Japan and South Korea. As a State Department official in the Obama administration, Mr. Campbell devised the so-called “pivot” to Asia.
“Biden has chosen people who understand and are committed to strategic competition,” said Thomas Wright, a foreign-policy expert at the Brookings Institution.
Some experts argue that the chaos at the Capitol had compromised the nation’s traditional role as a champion of democracy, and that the cascading domestic crises would consume Mr. Biden’s energy, distracting from world affairs.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Ambitious foreign-policy goals are completely out of step with the realities of the country’s domestic political and economic dysfunction,” Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in Foreign Policy.</span> “How can the United States spread democracy or act as an example for others if it barely has a functioning democracy at home?”
But Mr. Wright argued that the homegrown threats to democracy should strengthen the Biden administration’s resolve to fight human-rights abuses by China, Russia, and other autocratic governments.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve never understood the trade-off between ambition at home and ambition overseas,” he said.</span> “It’s precisely because democracy is challenged at home that the U.S. needs to be more energetic in defending democracy overseas.”
The links between domestic and foreign policy were reinforced by the appointment of Susan E. Rice, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Obama, as director of Mr. Biden’s domestic policy council. Key domestic priorities like the pandemic, experts pointed out, are also global challenges.
Another top Biden aide, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, used Twitter to weigh in on sensitive issues before his boss took office. He condemned Russia’s arrest of the opposition leader Alexei A. Navalny, appealed to the European Union to think twice before signing an investment treaty with China, and said Mr. Trump’s designation of the Houthi rebels in Yemen as a terrorist group “will only inflict more suffering on Yemeni people.”
Whether the Biden administration will back up those words with action remains to be seen, of course. But some say that Mr. Biden’s instincts, temperament and background as a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee make him unlikely to shrug off chances to command the world stage.
As vice president, he reveled in his access to world leaders. On a trip to Turkey <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> there were doubts that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was recuperating from a medical procedure, would see him. Instead, Mr. Erdogan invited him to his private residence, where the two men, wearing slippers, spoke for two hours about Syria and Iran.
“I don’t want to sound like I’m inflating my importance or relationship with him,” a chuffed Mr. Biden told reporters, “but we have listened to each other. And he was genuinely listening to my perspective and wasn’t challenging it.”
At other times, Mr. Biden has taken pride in his readiness to speak bluntly to foreign leaders. He famously walked out of a dinner with Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 after</span> a rancorous exchange over corruption.
<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2012,</span> Mr. Biden was assigned to play host to Xi Jinping, then China’s vice president and designated future leader, when he visited the United States. Toasting Mr. Xi at a Valentine’s Day lunch, Mr. Biden ran through a litany of grievances, from Chinese theft of intellectual property to human rights abuses.
“Cooperation, as you and I have spoken about, can only be mutually beneficial if the game is fair,” Mr. Biden said as Mr. Xi looked on.
On a trip to China the following year, Mr. Biden publicly criticized China for refusing to say if it would renew the visas of American correspondents and for blocking the websites of American-based news media. Several years later, China expelled correspondents for The New York Times and other publications.
Speaking as a president, to be sure, is different than as vice president. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">During his trip to Greece <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> Mr. Biden ruminated about the risks of commenting on the fiscal tensions between Greece and the European Union.
</span>“You know, in the good old days when I was a senator, I was my own man,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the time. “I could just tell you my views. But now whatever I say is attributed to the administration.”
“I finally learned that,” said the man who now leads his own administration. “It took me about six months, but I got it down.”

27000,"<h3>Ford to cut most car models in North America over the next four years</h3>DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it will shed most of its North American car lineup as part of broad plan to save money and make the company more competitive in a fast-changing marketplace.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The changes include getting rid of all cars in the region during the next four years except for the Mustang sports car and a compact Focus crossover vehicle, CEO Jim Hackett said as the company released first-quarter earnings.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The decision, which Hackett said was due to declining demand and profitability, means Ford will no longer sell the Fusion midsize car, Taurus large car, CMax hybrid compact and Fiesta subcompact in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Exiting most of the car business comes as the U.S. market continues a dramatic shift toward trucks and SUVs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Ford could also exit or restructure low-performing areas of its business, executives said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The company has found <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $11.5 billion</span> in cost cuts and efficiencies, bringing the total <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $25.5 billion</span> expected <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span></span> Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters.</span> Savings will come from engineering, product development, marketing, materials and manufacturing. The company previously <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">predicted $14 billion</span> in cuts <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2022.</span>
One-third of Ford’s belt-tightening will come by the end <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020,</span> Shanks said.
“We’re starting to understand what we need to do and making clear decisions there,” Hackett said.
Ford also promised to raise its operating profit margin <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.2 percent</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8 percent</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020,</span> two years earlier than a previous forecast. That includes <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 10 percent</span> pretax margin in North America.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company said its first-quarter net income <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 9 percent</span> due largely to a lower income tax rate.
</span>Ford <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">made $1.74 billion</span> from January through March, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 43 cents</span> per share, compared <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $1.59 billion</span>, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 40 cents</span> per share a year ago. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Revenue <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7 percent</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $41.96 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Earnings and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Analysts polled by FactSet <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 41 cents</span> per share on revenue <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $36.78 billion</span>.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">As usual, North America drove Ford’s profits for the quarter with pretax earnings <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.9 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Pretax automotive earnings <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell $443 million</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.7 billion</span>, mainly due to higher metals costs such as steel and aluminum.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Investors reacted favorably to the earnings.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Ford stock rose <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3 percent</span> in after-hours trading Wednesday <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $11.40.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Through the close of regular-session trading Wednesday, it has fallen <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11 percent</span> so far this year.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The cost savings will come by optimizing digital marketing and discounts on vehicles, as well as putting multiple vehicles on five flexible global architectures in the next few years.</span> The company currently builds vehicles on nine platforms that aren’t as flexible.
Shanks said Ford is “unleashing the creativity of the teams to challenge norms, challenge conventions.” Cuts and efficiencies are not done yet, he said.
Ford will <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cut $5 billion</span> from capital spending <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2019 to</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span> reducing it <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $34 billion</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $29 billion</span>. The company will spend less on low-performing areas such as cars. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">It identified Lincoln as a low-performing area but Shanks said sales are growing and the brand is not in jeopardy.</span> More capital will be allocated to higher performing areas such as trucks and sport utilities, he said.
Lower-performing areas will be targeted for restructuring and some areas could be targeted for “disposition,” Shanks said. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Shanks defined disposition as a different business model, efficiency improvements, exiting or downsizing.</span> “Whatever it takes,” he said.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Shanks wouldn’t say if employees would be cut but said nothing is off the table.
</span>Executives talked about the need to further improve operations in Europe and South America.
“We’ll restructure as necessary and we’ll be decisive,” Hackett said.

65149,"<h3>China Sends Yuan to Fresh Six-Month Low</h3>China Sends Yuan to Fresh Six-Month Low
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The currency’s value has also started to weaken not just against the dollar, but on a global basis
China’s central bank guided the yuan to its weakest value against the dollar in more than six months Thursday, the latest leg down for the Chinese currency in a slide that has gathered pace this week.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The People’s Bank of China set the dollar’s reference rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.5960 yuan</span>,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.6% lower</span> than its value in the previous day’s “fix,” which reflects the previous day’s close and overnight currency moves.</span> That put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since Dec.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20.</span>
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The yuan fell further shortly after trading began in mainland China, hitting its weakest value since Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> according to Wind Info.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In recent action, one dollar <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">bought 6.6167 yuan</span>, putting the Chinese currency on track for a daily loss <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.3%.</span>
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the offshore market, the yuan was little changed from the previous day with one dollar <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buying 6.6192 yuan</span>.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The yuan’s drop accelerated after China and the U.S. escalated threats of trade tariffs in the middle of this month, and got another push Sunday after China’s central bank announced measures to inject more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $100 billion</span> into the financial system.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The diverging fortunes of the world’s two largest economies argue for a weaker yuan.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates two more times this year due to the strong economy, while recent Chinese data suggest growth is starting to slow and the country’s central bank is likely to loosen policy further.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some analysts have argued China could use a yuan devaluation to fight back against U.S. tariffs on its exports.
</span>Still, Chinese authorities are eager to moderate the pace of the yuan’s depreciation, traders said. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">If the currency slides too quickly, it could spark destabilizing capital outflows that proved hard to tame in the months after the yuan’<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2015 devaluation</span>.
</span>Traders and investors say they are now watching the scale of the yuan’s latest decline in relation to other major currencies. The yuan has <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 1.8% against</span> the dollar this week, outpacing the euro’<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.8% fall</span>, the Japanese yen’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.2% slip</span> and the Korean won’<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.8% pullback</span>.
That means the yuan’s value has also started to weaken not just against the dollar, but on a global basis. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The dollar, euro, yen and won make up more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60% of</span> the yuan’s trade-weighted basket, which is closely monitored by the Chinese central bank.
</span>The yuan has now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 1.6% against</span> the greenback this year.

82117,"<h3>Full TPP Text Reveals A Very Bad Deal for America - Breitbart</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is finally public, after years of President Obama’s secret negotiations and a refusal to share the text openly with Congress and the American people.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Unsurprisingly, the document is full of special deals for various U.S. trading partners, foreign corporations, and multinational U.S. businesses.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The TPP is anything but the free trade agreement it purports to be.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The use of the term “free trade,” however, is both a smokescreen to conceal what it really contains and a codeword designed in part to attract the support of Congressional Republicans who lurch zombie-like to support anything labeled free trade, without understanding or even examining the details.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The top Obama Administration trade negotiator, Michael Froman, admitted as much when he insisted the deal cannot be re-negotiated, particularly over the lax rules on importing foreign-made autos and auto parts into the United States.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Apparently, one of America’s biggest economic problems is that Toyota does not sell enough cars and trucks here, and thus does not displace enough American jobs.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The TPP deal allows Toyota a special concession to keep its global supply chain intact.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">TPP lowers the already too low NAFTA parts content standard, and permits Toyota to export vehicles to the United States that contain a large percentage of parts produced in non-TPP countries.</span> And so, other Asian countries such as China, who are not even TPP partners are beneficiaries. Hard to believe, right?
U.S. auto makers and Congressional Democrats are unhappy with the concession and want it renegotiated. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But according to Froman, “Here we <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 12 countries</span>, half of whom we already have free trade agreements with, where every issue is tied to every other issue.</span> You pull the string out on one of these issues and you unravel the whole thing.” Thus Froman admits that the TPP deal is shot through with favoritism and crony arrangements…but it can’t be altered.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">A real free-trade deal could be written on a single sheet of paper, with commitments to remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers of any kind — including the removal of Value Added Taxes (VATs) applied to American exports at the port of entry — and pledges to refrain from the currency manipulation that cheapens and subsidizes the cost of foreign exports.</span> But is the TPP one page — or even two? No, it contains thousands of pages <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 30 chapters</span>, only a few of which deal with tariff reduction.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The other chapters deal with rules and regulations for all manner of things not directly related to trade.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">For example, there are labor and environmental chapters hailed by President Obama as the “most progressive ever.”
</span>But the big problem, whether one is for or against these chapters in principal, is that the president is deceiving us. These chapters are completely unenforceable. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Are we really going to have a fleet of labor rights and environmental inspectors cruising around Vietnam, checking to make sure that every last factory is being fair to its workers and not polluting?</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Or tramping through the jungles of Malaysia to make sure that the government has put an end to the human trafficking and forced labor camps?</span> No, it’s just not humanly possible.
Incidentally, there are two major missed opportunities within the TPP. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And these have to do with the United States not using a Value Added Tax (VAT) and not manipulating its currency.</span> Froman claims to have <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cut 18,000 tariffs</span> in the TPP, but he has completely neglected the most significant tariff of all — foreign VAT taxation. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">All of the other TPP countries (except tiny Brunei) utilize a VAT tax system.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">This is a major trade barrier that imposes a direct tax on U.S. exports, but it is completely unaddressed in the TPP.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As for currency manipulation, the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and is freely traded in markets throughout the world.</span> However, a significant number of TPP countries manipulate their currencies to give their goods a competitive advantage over American products.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But in the TPP, there are only side agreements to discuss currency manipulation via reporting requirements and consultative mechanisms.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">What these side deals mean is that a country can continue to intervene in currency markets, and then the U.S. can discuss the matter — without the ability to do anything about it.</span> That is not a concession or an “extremely meaningful” accomplishment, as Froman has said. It is a surrender — at a time when the U.S. could have addressed the problem.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">The TPP is being touted as giving a big boost to the American economy.</span> That’s the rationale for doing the deal in the first place, right?
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">But there is no economic study or model that shows any big net benefit to the United States.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">There is one Peterson Institute study, cited by the U.S. Trade Representative, that shows a <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minimal 0.4 percent</span> gain for the American economy <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025.</span></span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">That’s hardly enough to start reducing our immense and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">growing $18 trillion</span> national debt.</span> And two U.S. Department of Agriculture studies show no net gain in agriculture from the TPP. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Why sign the agreement if it doesn’t help with the national debt?</span> Two words: Special Interests.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ultimately, the TPP is a complex series of rules and regulations intended to manage the economic relations between <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 nations</span> party to the agreement.</span> And its meticulous design serves to benefit each country’s “national champion” companies and industries, with the big winners in the U.S. being the major Wall Street banks, insurance companies, and multinational manufacturer-outsourcers.
One big example of this complex hypocrisy: The TPP has, in addition <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 main</span> chapters, a total <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 58 side</span> agreements (called “side letters.”) <span id=""26"" class=""red"">And Japan alone <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">possesses 14 of</span> these side letters, with each one laying out special conditions for Japanese participation and special deals for Japanese economic sectors.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Free trade?</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Hardly!
Republicans allegedly hate regulatory regimes — but apparently are okay with them if they are done on an international scale under the rubric of free trade.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">What’s wrong with this picture and party?

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Prices have spiked during the recovery from the pandemic recession as Americans have ramped up spending on goods such as cars, furniture and appliances.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Those increased purchases have clogged ports and warehouses and exacerbated supply shortages of semiconductors and other parts.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Gas prices, while declining a bit from November to December, have surged in the past year, in part because Americans have driven more in recent months after having cut back on travel and commuting earlier in the pandemic.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Wednesday that excluding volatile food and gas prices, so-called core prices <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 0.6% from</span> November to December, slightly more than <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 0.5% increase</span> from October to November.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Measured year over year, core prices <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 5.5% in</span> December, the fastest such increase <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1991.</span>
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Rising prices have wiped out the healthy pay increases that many Americans have been receiving, making it harder for households, especially lower-income families, to afford basic expenses.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Poll show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern, making clear the political threat it poses to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">A significant portion of consumer inflation is still being driven by pandemic-driven mismatches between demand and supply.</span> Used car costs <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.5% from</span> November to December and have soared more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 37% compared</span> with a year ago. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">With new car production restrained by shortages of semiconductors, consumers have snapped up used cars, forcing up their costs.
Shortages at U.S. grocery stores have also grown more acute in recent weeks as new problems, like the omicron variant and severe weather, have compounded the supply chain struggles and labor shortages that have plagued retailers since the coronavirus pandemic erupted.

Updated Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 1</span>:08 pm ET

Millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure after the housing crash hit six years ago.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now, some of those families are back in the housing market.</span> Call them the ""boomerang"" buyers.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is difficult to quantify the exact number of boomerang buyers, but real-estate agents, mortgage brokers and home builders all say a significant number of new buyers are families and individuals who went through foreclosure as recently as three years ago, the time period that buyers who defaulted on a mortgage must typically wait before becoming eligible for a mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

</span>On a recent conference call with investors, Stuart Miller, chief executive of Miami-based home builder Lennar Corp., said the company was seeing more people ""coming out of the penalty box."" At Cornerstone Communities, a San Diego home builder, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 20 of</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 closings</span> they have had this year came from buyers who have been through a foreclosure or short sale, estimates Ure Kretowicz, the company's chief executive.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">""It's more than incremental business, that's for sure,"" adds Dan Klinger, president of K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, the mortgage arm of builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">With growing interest from these formerly delinquent buyers, K. Hovnanian provides its sales staff with a flier with industry guidelines listing the mortgage-eligibility rules for all types of derogatory events, from foreclosure to bankruptcy filings.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">""The industry is saying, 'Pay your dues and then get back into the market,' "" Mr. Klinger says.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Using the three-year benchmark it takes to get an FHA-guaranteed loan, in this year's second quarter there <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 729,000 households</span> that were foreclosed upon during the bust that are now eligible to apply for an FHA mortgage, up <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 285,000 in</span> the second quarter <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011,</span> according to an analysis of foreclosure data by Moody's Analytics.</span> The company projects that number will grow <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.5 million</span> by the first quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014.</span>

Typical boomerang buyers are people like April Del Rosario, who purchased her first home <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 when</span> she <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 24 years</span> old. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Newly married and unsure of what terms such as adjustable-rate mortgage meant, Ms. Del Rosario and her husband <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $315,000 for</span> a two-bedroom condominium in San Diego's Mission Valley area, a location they picked because it was central to their jobs.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2,600 monthly</span> mortgage payment was already a struggle, but when the mortgage rate was adjusted higher and Ms. Del Rosario became pregnant, the couple was overwhelmed.</span> They lost the home to foreclosure <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span>

""We were really young and stupid,"" she says. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">""All of a sudden, our already really expensive mortgage was going to go up.</span> I was pregnant and everything was just bad timing on our part.<span id=""10"" class=""red"">""

Three years later, the couple is back in the market.</span> The Del Rosarios were recently approved for a loan for <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $280,000 home</span> in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, which, when it is completed in January, will have three bedrooms and a two-car garage. Instead of proximity to work, they picked the location based on its school district and their desire to live there a long time. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while they now must <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $300 a</span> month in mortgage insurance, the family's income has grown, and their total mortgage payment is still a little lower than before, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $2,400.</span></span> ""We're trying to be really conservative. We just want to have a nice place for our son,"" she says.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">There is a web of rules for when and how people who have lost homes to foreclosure or short sales or have gone through a bankruptcy can become eligible for a new mortgage.</span> It typically takes three years after a foreclosure or short sale for a buyer to qualify for an FHA-backed loan. In many cases, it takes just one year after a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</span> discharge, according to the agency.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac require a wait period of as much as seven years after a foreclosure or short sale before a consumer can become eligible for a conventional mortgage, though some short sellers can purchase again after as little as two years.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Becoming eligible for a new mortgage doesn't mean that buyers will necessarily qualify for one.</span> Lenders still require borrowers to have strong credit score and to have been paying their other bills on time.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Until recently, many of the people who had lost their home to foreclosure or short sale have rented homes, leaving many economists and industry watchers to wonder if the nation would become more of a renter society.</span> In the second quarter, the national home-ownership rate came in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 65.5%,</span> down <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 65.9% a</span> year earlier <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 69.2% in</span> the second quarter <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2004.</span> Each percentage-point decline represents about one million households.

But as rental rates continue rising—they <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 0.8% in</span> the third quarter to a national average <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1,090 per</span> month, according to Reis Inc.—homeownership is increasingly becoming cheaper than renting.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">That is part of what enticed Ronda Martinez,<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 39,</span> back in to the market.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2007,</span> she and her husband, Mark, let their two-story,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $430,000 home</span> in Perris, Calif., go into foreclosure when they were unable to sell it when required to move to Phoenix for a job.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Later, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> she was laid off from her job at a real-estate-data company.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Since then, the family has repaired their finances, and Mrs. Martinez found a new job.</span> This month, the family is closing on <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $150,000 home</span> in Phoenix that has five bedrooms and a pool in the back.

""Initially people are upset and think, 'I'll never buy again,' "" she said. But ""there's no reason to give up on owning.""

14424,"<h3>U.S. Nears Shutdown as House Votes To Delay Health Law</h3>Updated Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:53 am ET

WASHINGTON—The U.S. government moved to within hours of its first shutdown <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1996,</span> as House Republicans redoubled their drive early Sunday to delay the new health care law and Senate Democrats stood firm against changing the law as a condition of funding federal departments.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The standoff left little prospect that Congress could reach agreement on terms for funding the government by midnight Monday, when the current fiscal year expires.</span> A shutdown would leave essential services operating but prompt federal agencies to suspend many functions and furlough hundreds of thousands of workers.

On a 231-192 vote, the House early Sunday passed a one-year delay of the health law, often called Obamacare, and attached it to a plan to fund the government through Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15.</span> The legislation now goes to the Senate. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">It also includes a provision repealing a tax on medical devices intended to help finance the health law, which the House approved on a 248-174 vote.

</span>But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), in a statement issued hours before the House took up the bill, pledged to strip out the health provisions. He denounced the GOP vote as ""pointless"" and declared the impasse to be back at ""<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Square 1.</span>""

The White House said that if the House bill reached President Barack Obama, who championed the health law, he would veto it.

The stare-down between the two chambers intensified as Democratic aides said Mr. Reid had no plans to call the Senate into session before its planned Monday afternoon return. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That will be just hours before government funding for many federal functions runs out with the end of the fiscal year.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The next step is unclear, as no official business on Capitol Hill is planned for Sunday.</span> There was no sign negotiations were being scheduled among congressional leaders, and no lawmakers—from graybeards to backbenchers—said they were optimistic that a shutdown would be averted.

In a blunt acknowledgment of that prospect, the House early Sunday also approved legislation to ensure that military personnel would be paid in the event of a shutdown.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Republicans have been determined to use the budget deadline as leverage in their long-running battle to undercut the health care law, which reaches a landmark moment on Tuesday, when one of its most important components takes effect.</span> On that day, people can begin to sign up for health insurance policies through new online marketplaces.

""The American people don't want a government shutdown, and they don't want Obamacare,"" House Republican leaders said in a joint statement about their government-funding bill. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">""We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown.</span>""

""Maybe they'll panic and do the right thing for once,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) said of the Senate. ""Republicans are extremely unified at this point.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) was under pressure from conservative House members to carry the fight against the health law as long as possible.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""Pushing until the very, very last minute has been one of the mainstays of the House GOP's negotiating strategy on budget issues,"" said Stan Collender a former aide to the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a budget specialist at Qorvis Communications.</span> If House Republicans eventually accede to a simple funding bill, shorn of changes to the new health law, it won't likely be until the 11th hour on Monday, he said.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Some Republicans held hope that the Senate would agree at least to repeal the medical devices tax, giving the House GOP a victory.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">In votes earlier this year, senators from both parties backed a repeal, but Democrats were unlikely to do so as part of the current budget fight.

</span>Democrats criticized House Republican leaders for moving to pass measures so close to the deadline that were bound to fail in the Senate. The longest-serving member of the House, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) had particularly harsh words.

""This once-deliberative body has been taken over by knaves and know-nothings, content with putting partisan politics ahead of the American people,'' Mr. Dingell said.

He added: ""I believe that this current Congress would be incapable of passing the Ten Commandments or even the Lord's Prayer, and today's actions have only further galvanized that belief.""

<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 800,000 of</span> more than two million federal workers were furloughed in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1995 shutdown</span>, with fewer workers affected in a following shutdown that stretched into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 1996.</span> The number who would be furloughed this time is unclear and would vary by agency. The Pentagon has said <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 400,000 civilian</span> defense workers would be sent home.

Postal and air traffic control services would continue, and Social Security checks would be mailed. But many federal functions would be suspended, such as surveillance of flu and other diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National parks and museums would close.

Some Republicans said that the bill taken up by the House on Saturday night was unlikely to break the stalemate. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the Senate, Democratic leaders can strike the health care delay and medical device tax amendments with a 51-vote majority, then send the funding bill back to the House.

</span>Lawmakers weren't sure what Mr. Boehner's next step would be in that case.

The House could pass the Senate's funding measure, stripped of provisions related to the health law, and send it to Mr. Obama, as the Senate has insisted. Lawmakers could also buy more time by passing a short extension of funding, perhaps for a week.

But Republicans said they might take another stab at amending the spending bill and dare the Senate to let the government shut down. At the same time, some of the GOP caucus's more centrist members worried about the rapidly shrinking window of time. ""I hope it works, but it may not,'' said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.).

The House bill emerged midday from an uncommon Saturday meeting of the House Republican Conference, where GOP leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers agreed on the details of their bill.

Many House Republicans say their party would likely bear more of the public blame if the government is forced into a partial shutdown. But some argued Saturday that wasn't a reason to shift course.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Republicans said they believed that economic benefits flowing from a repeal of the medical-device tax would offset the loss of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $29 billion</span> in revenue <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10 years</span>, the sum that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the tax will generate.

</span>And some Republicans argued that their proposal to delay the health-care law by one year represented a compromise between their earlier push to defund the law and Democrats' desire to keep it unchanged.

""Just delay this thing for one year—it's really not too much to ask,"" said Rep. Trey Radel (R., Fla.).

Democrats, by contrast, saw little compromise in the House Republican plan. ""It's their way or the highway, and the highway leads over the cliff,"" said Rep. Sandy Levin (D., Mich.).

In the vote to delay the health law, two Republicans broke from their party to oppose a delay. They were New York Reps. Chris Gibson and Richard Hanna.

Two Democrats voted in favor of the one-year delay: Reps. Jim Matheson (D., Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D., N.C.).

The White House and congressional Democrats are opposed to delaying the health law but have indicated they would entertain changes to improve the bill. But they have firmly opposed talking about even modest changes as part of negotiating the government funding bill.

91844,"<h3>Fed Minutes Show Most Officials Favored Slowing Rate Rises Soon</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON—Most Federal Reserve officials thought they should slow the pace of interest-rate increases after approving <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.75</span>-percentage-point rate rise at their meeting earlier this month to battle high inflation.
</span>Their discussion at the meeting, described in minutes of the gathering released Wednesday, suggests they could downshift to a rate rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.5 percentage</span> point, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 50 basis</span> points, at their meeting next month.
“A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would soon be appropriate,” the minutes said.
Officials approved the fourth consecutive supersize rate increase at their Nov. 1-2 meeting, bringing their benchmark rate to a range <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 3.75% and</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">They are boosting rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s to reduce inflation that is running near a 40-year high.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">All 19 officials</span> at the meeting supported the decision to raise rates this month and broadly agreed they needed to keep lifting them, the minutes showed. Still, the discussion revealed some were more anxious about the possibility of overdoing the increases, while others worried they might not be making enough progress to warrant a downshift.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Some from the first camp said the risks were rising that the Fed’s rate increases might ultimately “exceed what was required to bring inflation back” to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% goal</span></span>.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A few also warned that continuing to raise rates <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 0.75</span>-point increments “increased the risk of instability or dislocations in the financial system,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">A small minority believed it might be better to wait to slow increases until rates were “more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">At their September meeting, most Fed officials projected that they would raise the benchmark federal-funds to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 4.6% early</span> next year.
</span>Officials didn’t release new rate projections at their meeting this month. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 news</span> conference that if they had, they would have been higher given recent strength in the labor market and high inflation readings.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The minutes said that officials thought that high inflation and the strong labor market would call for raising the benchmark federal-funds rate next year to a level “somewhat higher than they had previously expected.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Fed is raising rates to combat inflation by slowing the economy through tighter financial conditions—such as higher borrowing costs, lower stock prices and a stronger dollar—which typically curb demand.
</span>The central bank’s staff saw a U.S. recession next year “as almost as likely” as their baseline projection of weak growth, the minutes showed. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That represented a downgrade of the economic outlook due to the tightening of financial conditions that had occurred this fall.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Is the Fed taking the right steps to combat inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.
In more recent public comments, officials have broadly endorsed approving <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5</span>-point increase at their Dec. 13-14 meeting as they acknowledged the risks of causing an unnecessarily deep downturn.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“A rate hike <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50 basis</span> points would still be significant,” said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in a speech earlier this month.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Fed governor Christopher Waller last week said the central bank could still raise rates aggressively in coming months even if officials reduce the size of their increases <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.5 point</span>.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He compared the Fed’s task to a pilot finding a comfortable cruising altitude after takeoff.</span> “As the policy rate gets higher, the stronger is the case for slowing the rate of ascent while continuing to climb,” he said.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">This summer and fall, several Fed officials suggested they would want to see evidence that inflation is declining toward <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% goal</span></span> before slowing or stopping rate increases.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">But at a press conference on Nov.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span> Mr. Powell suggested a sequence of slower inflation readings had never been “the appropriate test” for slowing or halting rate rises.
</span>Instead, officials including Mr. Powell have shifted the focus toward how high rates might have to rise. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Investors in interest-rate futures markets expect the Fed to raise the fed-funds rate to slightly <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 5% by</span> next March, according to CME Group.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Consumer prices rose more slowly in October than in recent months, according to the Labor Department.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.3% from</span> September, the smallest monthly gain in one year, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6.3% on</span> a year-over-year basis, down <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.6%.</span>

23424,"<h3>Crude Slump, Pipeline Expansion Mark End of U.S. Oil-Train Boom</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Crude Slump, Pipeline Expansion Mark End of U.S. Oil-Train Boom
As more pipelines reach shale regions, producers have a cheaper way to move their oil to market
The oil-train boom is waning almost as quickly as it began.
</span>Rail became a major way to move crude after companies began unlocking new bounties of oil from shale formations, with volumes rising from almost nothing <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 to</span> more than one million barrels a day <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2014,</span> according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">But those numbers began falling after oil prices started tumbling two years ago, and aren’t projected to recover anytime soon.</span> In April, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 430,000 barrels</span> of oil rode the rails each day, according to the latest federal figures.

</span></span></span></span>Some of the decline came from a drop in U.S. oil production, but oil and rail executives say the drop-off may be permanent.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“At least some portion, and it could be a pretty large portion,” of the rail business won’t return, said Union Pacific Corp. UNP -0.11 % Chief Executive Lance Fritz.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">More pipelines have begun reaching North Dakota and other shale regions, giving producers a cheaper way to move their oil to market.
</span>Also, a string of fiery crude-freight-train derailments—including one in Lac Mégantic, Quebec, that <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 47 people</span> in 2013—have prompted a host of new and expensive regulations, and fueled opposition that has helped delay major rail projects on the West Coast, where a dearth of pipelines makes rail useful. Regulators have mandated new safer tank cars, and older tank cars are being phased out—adding to future costs for transporting oil.
The changes are evident in North Dakota, once the epicenter of the crude-by-rail trend. Oil output from the state’s Bakken Shale formation has fallen <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 180,000 barrels</span> a day from <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2014 peak</span>. Meanwhile, pipeline takeaway capacity has more than doubled <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span>
EOG Resources Inc., <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">EOG 0.97 </span>% one of the first oil companies to see the potential for trains to relieve pipelines, opened its first rail loading terminal in Stanley, N.D., <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span> But that terminal hasn’t loaded a train in more than a year, according to Genscape, a data provider that tracks activity at U.S. rail terminals.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“New pipeline infrastructure has been put in place to move significant volumes of oil to market,” an EOG spokeswoman said.
</span>Enough pipeline capacity is coming online to replace all of the current volume BNSF Railway Co. is shipping out of North Dakota, said David Garin, the railroad’s group vice president of industrial products.
BNSF used to transport as many <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 12 trains</span> daily filled with crude primarily from North Dakota’s Bakken Shale, carrying <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% of</span> all rail traffic out of the area. Now it is down to about five a day.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Will this business be back <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 trains</span> a day?</span> Probably not,” said Mr. Garin. “Will it be zero? Probably not.”
Even at its height <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> crude-by-rail accounted for less <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2% of</span> total rail volumes, according to Association of American Railroads data. But its decline threatens what was once viewed as a sizable driver of growth for the railroad industry, one that many rail companies, along with oil and gas producers, made investments to support.
<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2010 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 89 terminals</span> were built or expanded in the U.S. and Canada to load crude on trains, and nearly as many to offload it, according to consulting firm RBN Energy LLC.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The oil pouring out of U.S. fields was so much cheaper—more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $20 a</span> barrel below international benchmark prices at times—that refineries were eager to pay higher rail shipping costs in exchange for some of it.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">New pipelines have helped shrink that price difference by allowing the landlocked oil to reach market.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">And the U.S. has lifted a ban on crude exports, which allows American crude to be sent abroad freely and is expected to help keep U.S. and international crude prices more closely aligned.
</span>Now oil trains are competing against tanker ships carrying foreign crude. Analysts say rail deliveries are likely to fall even further once shipping contracts signed during the boom expire in the coming months.
There could soon be more than enough space to carry away all Bakken oil through pipelines now in the works. <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phillips 66 PSX</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.24 </span>% is partnering with pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ETP 0.05 </span>% LP to develop a pair of pipelines that will bring North Dakota crude to Illinois and then down to Texas.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The endeavor, which will cost close <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5 billion</span>, is expected to take a major bite out of oil train traffic, even though the pipelines will ultimately bring oil to the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico, rather than to the East and West coasts, where trains have primarily taken it.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phillips 66 said</span> earlier this year it may still be cheaper to take that oil and put it on a barge for delivery by sea to the coasts than to send it directly there by train.

84559,"<h3>Virginia company giving 10 workers a chance at a year’s pay with vaccine lottery</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">A Reston-based IT company is giving its employees a chance to win a year’s pay for the price of a coronavirus vaccine.

</span>Leidos Inc., a government contractor with a global workforce <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 40,000,</span> has set <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">aside $1 million</span> to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reward 10 randomly</span> selected workers through its vaccine lottery. The company aims to ramp up its inoculation rates, which like the rest of the country have slowed down.

Though vaccine supplies are plentiful, more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 in</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 U</span>.S. adults still aren’t fully vaccinated, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sixty-seven percent had gotten at least one dose as of <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 3,</span> which remains shy of President Biden’s goal <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 70 percent</span> — a crucial benchmark toward reaching herd immunity — by the Fourth of July.

“Our company, like the country at large, has seen a bit of a slowdown in the number of people actually getting the vaccine,” Roger Krone, chairman and chief executive of Leidos, told The Post. “We see a huge need to gently push people who are on the fence, and give them one more reason to do it.”

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Though Leidos has been spared from the widespread outbreaks seen in the grocery, meatpacking and other industries, the company said it has lost eight employees to the pandemic.</span> One of them, Keith Redding, was among the first to die of the virus in the D.C. area. A company foundation in his name has <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $1.8 million</span> to the families of other coronavirus victims.

But as companies like Leidos prepare for a full return to in-person work, managers are working to guard their factory floors and office hallways against becoming points of transmission for a virus that has killed more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 604,000 Americans</span>.

The fast-moving delta variant, which poses special risk to unvaccinated people, has upped the ante. The nation’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has called it the “greatest threat” to ending the U.S. pandemic. The delta variant also moved the Biden administration to activate “surge response” teams that will deploy additional expertise and supplies to hot spots.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has confirmed that federal law, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, does not preclude companies from making vaccinations mandatory in the workforce.</span> Some companies have done so, occasionally stirring controversy.

Other are opting for the carrot over the stick. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Retail and grocery chains including Trader Joe’s, Aldi and Dollar General have used various incentives to encourage vaccinations.</span> In most cases, the incentives add up to a few hundred dollars or a day off.

Coming off a profitable year, executives from <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $14.5 billion</span> company wanted to craft an incentive program that would make more of a splash. Krone and other executives said they chose a lottery after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), announced that he would offer <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">five $1 million</span> prizes to vaccinated state residents, along with four-year college scholarships for five vaccinated Ohioans younger <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 18.</span>

Five days after its rollout, the Ohio Department of Health announced the Vax-a-Million campaign had driven <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28 percent</span> increase in the vaccination rates of <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">residents 16 and</span> older. Other states have also gone the lottery route, including Maryland, Oregon and California.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Leidos’s lottery will award each employee the equivalent of one year of salary.</span> Because managers are excluded from the sweepstakes, the company estimates its outlay will be <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1 million</span>

The company announced the initiative last Monday, along with a call for sign-ups, and has already enrolled more than a third of its workforce. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Employees are not required to show proof of vaccination when they sign up.

</span>Those with a legitimate reason to opt out of the vaccine, such as a medical condition, can still enter the sweepstakes without getting inoculated, an executive said. But <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 winners</span> will be required to show a vaccine card before receiving their lump-sum payment.

“In the end, in a time of crisis, what people are about is providing safety, health and security for their family,” Krone said. “I can’t wait to celebrate our first few winners.”"

“We are open to discussions on structural issues,” said a White House spokeswoman. “We are looking to China to address these concerns” and to bring “concrete proposals.”

The talks would be the first in more than two months. During that time, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods and Beijing responded with levies of its own. Officials on both sides have said that their counterparts seemed uninterested in concessions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The dispute has hit China’s stock markets and currency while largely sparing U.S. markets.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Now, trade analysts said, U.S. plans to move ahead in coming weeks with penalties <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> more in Chinese goods are raising the stakes.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The talks are necessary to avoid a complete rupture of China-U.S. relations, although the chance of coming to an agreement is low,” said Mei Xinyu, an analyst at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry and a frequent critic of U.S. trade policy.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The August discussions will be held at a lower level than previous efforts, which were helmed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The talks—to be led by Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass and Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen—are meant to be exploratory, providing a way for both sides to save face should progress prove elusive, said people briefed on the discussions.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Chinese side will also be represented by Finance Vice Minister Liao Min, who is a top aide to Vice Premier Liu He, and Chinese Commerce Ministry Deputy Director Zhao Na.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The U.S. Treasury has been refining its demands for Beijing, those people said, including lowering tariffs, ending policies that press U.S. firms to transfer technology to Chinese partners and improving market access for foreign companies to reduce what the U.S. calculates is <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $375 billion</span> trade imbalance in China’s favor last year.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Another item on the U.S. agenda, the people say, is persuading Beijing to raise the value of its currency to its pre-dispute level.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The U.S. has complained for years that Beijing manipulates the yuan’s value to help boost its exports.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The currency has fallen <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 10% against</span> the greenback since April, though it briefly rose <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 0.5% Thursday</span> after the news of the coming talks.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">China’s central bank has attributed the yuan’s weakness to market reaction to a strengthening U.S. dollar.

</span>Largely as a result of the falling yuan, Mr. Trump ordered that the prospective tariffs <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> in Chinese goods be raised to as high <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 25% from</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10% so</span> Beijing can’t use devaluation to limit the tariff’s sting.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">U.S. officials have said that in previous talks their Chinese counterparts showed little imagination in addressing American complaints about unfair trade practices.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Chinese officials, meanwhile, have privately said the U.S. demands are too wide-ranging and are ultimately aimed at getting Beijing to dismantle its government-supported economic system.

</span>Divisions within the U.S. government are likely to loom over the coming talks.

Some analysts add that the Chinese side is likely to be wary of promises made by U.S. officials that aren’t directly endorsed by Mr. Trump. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Messrs. Mnuchin and Liu declared a truce in the trade fight in late May only to have Mr. Trump announce shortly afterward a decision to go ahead with tariffs.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">As the Treasury works to restart negotiations with Beijing, the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to hold public hearings starting Monday on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $200 billion</span></span> in tariffs.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Trump administration’s more hawkish trade advisers argue that Beijing will become more willing to make concessions as the additional tariffs hit.</span> China has said it would respond with additional tariffs.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">These U.S. trade advisers believe China’s economy is weaker than commonly believed and that America’s strengthening economy gives them room to maneuver politically, even if some U.S. industries feel pain from the tariff fight.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The Trump administration is also putting the finishing touches on a plan to compensate farmers for falling prices caused by the trade battle.

</span>Some analysts and lobbyists said differing agendas within the U.S. government and between Washington and Beijing would likely confound progress in the talks.

“This is a waste of time for the two governments, especially China’s. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">If there isn’t a conversation centered around seriously limiting Chinese industrial policy and USTR isn’t representing the U.S., it’s a meaningless discussion,” said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, using an abbreviation for the trade representative.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">David French, a trade lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, a U.S. trade association, said: “I’m not sure the U.S. administration position is clear.</span> It could be difficult for the Chinese to understand what our direction is or what our purpose is with tariffs.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">In its brief statement announcing the talks, China’s Commerce Ministry said Beijing “won’t accept any unilateral trade restrictions.”

</span>If Beijing wants to head off the planned tariffs <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> in goods, some analysts said, it could try promising to buy a large amount of U.S. products. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Chinese officials offered in June to buy <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70 billion</span> in U.S. agriculture and energy goods, falling short of <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $200 billion</span></span> Mr. Trump wanted to reduce the U.S. deficit by.</span> Senior U.S. officials dismissed that offer as hype, arguing that the amount offered was far less <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $70 billion</span>.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It would be critically important for China to bring measurable deliverables,” said Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council.

73198,"<h3>Shopping Spree for Wall Street</h3>Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 8</span>:34 pm ET

A flurry of acquisitions announced within hours of each other Thursday, for everything from ketchup to airlines to drug wholesaling, suggests big-time deal-making is back after a nearly six-year absence from Wall Street.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mergers and acquisitions took a sharp tumble after the financial crisis, as economic uncertainty and paranoia on corporate boards kept deal-making on the sidelines.</span> This year, though, has been different.

<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $40 billion</span>-worth of deals struck Thursday brings the total value of M&A transactions announced since January to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $160 billion</span>, the fastest start to a year <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> according to Dealogic. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">M&A volumes historically follow the lead of the stock market, and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 6.67% increase</span> in the Standard & Poor'<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 500 Index</span> this year suggests more are on the way.

</span>""The dam is burst,"" said James B. Lee, the veteran deal maker who is vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. He is stitching together his own deal: <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $24.4 billion</span> takeover of Dell Inc. by its founder and a private-equity firm. ""The forces were too powerful to hold back forever,"" Mr. Lee said.

In addition to the Heinz deal, the highlights of Thursday's bonanza were <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $11 billion</span> merger between AMR Corp. and US Airways Group; a reworked deal for beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev NV over the divestment of some brands to rival Constellation Brands Inc. <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $4.75 billion</span>; and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc.'<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $2 billion</span> purchase of rival AssuraMed.

M&A bankers are renowned for their optimism, no matter the conditions. But Mr. Lee and others argue that the recent spate of large deals, which also include <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $16 billion</span> merger of cable companies Liberty Global Inc. and Virgin Media Inc., and <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $18.1 billion</span> to be spent by Comcast Corp. to buy General Electric Corp. out of broadcaster NBCUniversal, are more than coincidental timing.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Their argument is this: Companies have largely exhausted the benefits of cutting costs and improving productivity since the recession.</span> They are now looking elsewhere for the level of growth that keeps shareholders happy. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Deals, economic theory goes, are one way.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Business productivity spiked in the aftermath of the recession, as companies cut workers and aggressively pared back costs.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2008 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2009,</span> for instance, productivity surged <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6%,</span> according to data compiled by the St. Louis Fed.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The rate of productivity increases has slowed considerably since then and at the end <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2012 were</span> less <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1% annually</span>.

</span>The new attitude might be summed up by publicly traded 1-800-FLOWERS.com. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In a Feb.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 conference</span> call with analysts, chief financial officer William E. Shea described how the company's balance sheet had changed <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Back then, he said, the company had <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $130 million</span> of debt.</span> Today, the sum is <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $20 million</span>.

""We're not afraid of making acquisitions,"" Mr. Shea said. ""But

during this past period of time, that wasn't the right thing for us to do... We think we can get organic growth rates moving north of where they are today... And if we can find the right company and strike the right deal, we will do that.<span id=""9"" class=""red"">""

One thing that has changed is an alignment of both credit and stock markets.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> both are rallying at the same time, offering cheap credit to buyers and the prospect of acceptable prices to sellers.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Both the H.J. Heinz Co.'s acquisition and the Dell deal involve large debt packages from banks.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Financial groups are again willing to bankroll deals of such size because bankers are confident they can quickly sell the debt to yield-hungry investors.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Loan investors like large deals, too, because they are easier to buy and sell on the secondary market.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">""To me, this is the sweet spot of the leveraged loan market,"" said Christine McConnell, who <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $11 billion</span> of loan investments at Fidelity Investments.

</span>Few expect a return to the swashbuckling transactions of the late 1990s or mid-2000s, when cheap money, lavish lending by banks and aggressive private equity groups led to some poor acquisition choices.

Since then, activist investors have gained greater sway inside board rooms, often enforcing a sharp discipline on company executives, especially those with a taste for creative deal-making.

The U.S. government also has stepped forward, stopping AT&T Inc.'s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> and, just weeks ago, suing to stop Anheuser-Busch InBev NV'<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $20.1 billion</span> deal to take control of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo SAB.

In the months ahead, two paths seem mostly likely for deal making. The first uses M&A as a bridge between U.S. and foreign markets, with capital flowing into U.S. companies rather than the reverse.

Japan's Softbank Corp. is spending <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $33.4 billion</span> to take over Sprint Nextel Corp. Chinese companies, for instance, spent more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 billion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 46 U</span>.S.-bound deals <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> Investors should also expect more incoming deals via rapidly developing conglomerates in such places as Turkey, South Korea and Indonesia.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">""The sources of capital are global and the fundamental nature of our business is cross-border,"" said Antonio Weiss, global head of investment banking at</span> Lazard Ltd. ""What is happening is a redeployment of capital that has been built up in one region into another.<span id=""16"" class=""red"">""

The second path will be standard industry-rationalizing deals, which may have been contemplated for years but lacked market confidence to complete.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Look especially for activity in energy, real estate and financial services.

</span>Late last year, Avalonbay Communities Inc. <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $15.9 billion</span> on a once-battered real-estate investment trust called Archstone-Smith.

And it seems only a matter of time until greater consolidation comes to Wall Street's own door, as now-stabilized banks find mergers a painful, if inevitable, next step after internal restructuring.

73533,"<h3>Central Banks Move to Drive Down Currencies, Yielding Domino Effect</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Interest-Rate Cuts, Asset Purchases Ricochet Through Foreign-Exchange Markets; ‘Unspoken Currency War Has Broken Out’

Updated Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 7</span>:28 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The central-bank stimulus spree <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015 has</span> the look of a global currency war.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In quick succession, countries representing about a third of the world’s economic output—from the eurozone to China, Australia and Canada—have taken steps that have driven down the value of their currencies.

</span>But if it’s a war, it’s a gentle one so far.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Half the central banks representing the Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 developed</span> and large emerging economies, whose top monetary and finance officials meet to discuss the global economy this week in Istanbul, have taken easing steps so far this year.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves—mainly in the form of interest-rate cuts but also asset purchases—have ricocheted through foreign-exchange markets, driving the currencies of some countries down and those of others, primarily the U.S., up.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That helps the economies of countries that are easing while complicating life for some central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and creating challenges for exporters, from the U.S. to Switzerland and Denmark.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” David Woo and Vadim Iaralov at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, noting that the magnitude of currency-market swings this year has hit its highest noncrisis level <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 20 years</span>.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mention of currency war evokes images of countries deliberately trying to force their currencies down to boost exports and curb imports at their neighbors’ expense.</span> By definition, it’s a zero-sum game.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">This is a bit different: Central banks by and large aren’t specifically aiming to achieve a certain—weak—exchange rate, for instance by buying up foreign currencies on the open market, as in currency wars of the past.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They are doing what they think is best for their economies and, if their currencies weaken in response, so much the better.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">With the possible exception of Switzerland, whose economy may be rattled by the sudden surge in the franc after the country’s central bank unexpectedly dropped its currency ceiling against the euro last month, there aren’t any clear victims yet.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Indeed, there’s a positive-sum aspect to these currency wars.</span> As one central bank eases, others are forced to follow suit to offset the upward pressure on their currencies.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Unlike past easy-money campaigns, these latest efforts—from economies totaling <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $36 trillion</span> in annual output—aren’t aimed at addressing financial crises, as with the U.S.-led global effort six years ago.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rather, central banks are taking aim at the risks of too-low inflation and weak economic growth.

</span>The frenzy of easing policies began in Europe, once a center of conservative central banking with Germany’s Bundesbank at its core. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program, mostly government debt, last month that could swell beyond €1 trillion (<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1.13 trillion</span>) by the fall <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016.</span>

</span>That sent a tidal wave through the continent. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Switzerland responded before the program was even announced last month by abandoning the ceiling it had set on the franc’s level against the euro, as markets widely anticipated the ECB’s move, while Denmark slashed interest rates four times in three weeks.</span> Switzerland and Denmark also accumulated massive amounts of foreign currencies last month to keep a lid on their currencies’ strength. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Sweden and Poland might cut rates in coming weeks, analysts say, and the Czech central bank has said it is ready to take steps to keep its currency weak against the euro.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Europeans have turned the common-sense idea that official interest rates can go only so low on its head.</span> Deposit rates on bank reserves set by the Swiss and Danish central banks are each at -0.75%. The ECB also has a negative deposit rate, at -0.2%, which means banks must pay a fee to park excess cash with their central bank.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“We are sort of testing the limits,” said Ángel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

</span>These policies have brought bond yields to rock-bottom levels and pushed equities higher. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The hope is that all this global easing will bolster global demand.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">But there are doubts as to how much more stimulus officials can get from asset markets.

</span>That leaves currencies as the main transmission channel. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">In an era of weak global growth and very low inflation, central bankers can take aggressive currency-weakening measures such as printing money or pushing rates into negative territory without having to worry about any inflationary consequences.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">That makes exports cheaper in economies with looser monetary policies, and more expensive in those that are holding the line.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Even if recent measures haven’t been directly aimed at currencies, “the impact of domestically oriented policies naturally has an impact on the exchange rate,” said Hung Tran, managing director at the Institute of International Finance.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The U.S. is already seeing the negative effects of a stronger dollar, with trade slicing one percentage point from fourth-quarter growth.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Still, its economy is cranking out jobs at a rapid pace.

</span>With Europe still wrestling with stagnation and political turmoil in Greece, and growth softening in key emerging markets such as China, the pressure on central banks will likely remain intense.

11356,"<h3>Inside the special counsel’s long hunt to uncover whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia</h3>On a cloudy day in early November, the last of conservative writer Jerome Corsi’s six marathon interviews with the office of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was about to begin. Sitting in a building in Southwest Washington, three prosecutors assigned to his case opened with a lecture.
For more than two months, they had been chasing tantalizing leads offered by Corsi, an associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone who had told them that the longtime GOP operative sought a back channel to WikiLeaks during <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span>.
They had dispatched FBI agents around the country to interview potential witnesses, expending valuable government money and precious time — only to find themselves unable to untangle Corsi’s assertions that Stone knew in advance that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
“No lies, hunches, wishes,” prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky lectured Corsi that day as they sat in a windowless conference room, according to notes taken by Corsi’s lawyer, David Gray. “Hopes do not equal facts. Don’t tell us what you think we want to hear.”
The Yale-educated former Supreme Court clerk pleaded with Corsi: It was “vitally important” that Corsi provide the “truth only,” Zelinsky said.
The trio of top prosecutors had spent weeks coaxing, cajoling and admonishing the conspiracy theorist as they pressed him to stick to facts and not reconstruct stories. At times, they had debated the nature of memory itself.
Once again that day, however, Corsi struggled to answer clearly questions about Stone and WikiLeaks — closing the door on an exhausting final chapter of Mueller’s nearly two-year hunt to determine whether anyone in Trump’s world had coordinated with Russia.
The investigation took the special counsel’s team down several meandering paths, propelled by discoveries of unusual interactions between Trump associates and Russians. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had shared internal information with an employee assessed by the FBI to have Russian intelligence ties.</span> Foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was tipped off that the Russians had thousands of Clinton’s emails. Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who he hoped would offer damaging information about Clinton.
[Mueller’s report paints a portrait of a campaign intrigued by Russian overtures]
In the end, Mueller’s final report, a redacted version of which was released by Attorney General William P. Barr on Thursday, laid out new details about the Russian effort to influence <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span> through social media and the hacking of Democratic emails, and it offered a rich portrait of Trump’s efforts as president to undermine the investigation and mislead the public.
The 448-page report also revealed the outcome of the long endeavor to determine the relationship between Trump associates and Russia: some unanswered mysteries, a lot of dead ends and, ultimately, a conclusion that the contacts they found did not establish a criminal conspiracy.
Stone has not been charged with serving as a conduit to WikiLeaks, which disseminated material stolen by Russians.
Instead, he was indicted in January for lying to Congress about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and has vehemently denied having any knowledge of what WikiLeaks held and the group’s exact plans. Stone has also denounced Corsi’s account as lies.
Corsi announced in November that he had rejected a deal to plead guilty to false statements and accused the special counsel’s office of trying to bully him into lying. He has not been charged with any crime.
A reconstruction of the laborious effort by Mueller’s team to determine whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia shows why it was often a maddeningly difficult task.
Their witnesses were not ideal. A few key players, prosecutors would contend, lied in interviews. Many were loyal to the president and echoed his rhetoric that Mueller’s team was acting in bad faith. Some used encrypted applications with disappearing messages that could not be reviewed. Others were overseas, unreachable to American investigators.
In some cases, their statements were only loosely tethered to the facts.
This account is based on interviews with people who interacted with Mueller’s team, court documents and new details laid out in the special counsel’s report. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.
It was the first item in the order that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein issued in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2017 when</span> he appointed Mueller as special counsel.
As part of his charge, Mueller would take over a preexisting FBI investigation into “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”
The inquiry had begun in late <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>after</span> the Australian government contacted the FBI about Papadopoulos. Over drinks at a bar in London, the young Trump aide had confided to an Australian diplomat that the Russian government had thousands of Clinton emails that could damage her candidacy.
By the time Mueller was appointed, the FBI had interviewed Papadopoulos and, according to him, tried unsuccessfully to get him to travel to London and surreptitiously record a conversation with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who told him about the Clinton emails. In <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 interview</span> with a British newspaper, Mifsud denied knowledge of the emails.
The FBI had also obtained a secret court order allowing them to monitor the communications of former Trump adviser Carter Page, who had traveled to Moscow during the heat of the campaign and interacted there with a Russian government official.
The work came against the backdrop of the publication of a research dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Clinton’s campaign, which claimed that Trump had engaged in a knowing conspiracy with Russia, which Trump dismissed as false.
The special counsel moved quickly on several fronts.
Weeks after Mueller was appointed, the FBI sent a search warrant to Google, scooping up Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s Gmail messages dating back to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> court records show. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">His emails began to help investigators uncover the extent of his efforts to develop a Trump Tower project in Moscow — an attempt that persisted through much of the campaign, even as Trump publicly denied he had business ties in Russia, court filings show.
</span>[‘We will be in Moscow’: The story of Trump’s 30-year quest to expand his brand to Russia]
By July, Mueller’s team was delving into Trump Jr.’s meeting the previous summer with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, which had also been attended by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort.
They started with a potentially neutral witness: the interpreter, interviewing him just four days after the New York Times broke the news of the meeting, according to the report.
Russian-born Anatoli Samochornov described to investigators what unfolded in the 20-minute meeting: Veselnitskaya raised the topic of Democratic donors who she alleged had broken Russian law. One of her associates then brought up a U.S. sanctions law against Russia and a ban on American adoptions of Russian children that the Kremlin had imposed in retaliation. Trump Jr. said there was little his father could do to address the issue, but said it could be revisited if Trump were elected.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017,</span> prosecutors interviewed Ike Kaveladze, an employee of Aras Agalarov, the Russian billionaire who had hosted Trump’s Miss Universe pageant <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 in</span> Moscow and requested the meeting through his son.
</span>“They asked very targeted questions,” said Kaveladze, who had attended the meeting as the Agalarov representative. “I realized they had significant knowledge of the topic.”
Mueller’s team interviewed everyone who attended the meeting except Veselnitskaya, who is in Russia, and Trump Jr., who declined to participate voluntarily, they wrote. (It is unclear whether prosecutors attempted to subpoena the president’s son.)
The picture that was emerging was one of a campaign that was eager for Russia’s help at the same time the Kremlin had been working to elect Trump.
<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">As 2017 stretched</span> on, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with Mifsud and two Russians.

But the special counsel still had not resolved whether Russia coordinated with Trump associates.
In September last year, Mueller’s team got a break. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Manafort, who had been a central figure in the investigation from the start, agreed to plead guilty to financial crimes and failing to register as a foreign lobbyist for work he had conducted in Ukraine before leading the Trump campaign.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">At last, prosecutors had access to a key member of Trump’s inner campaign circle who also had deep connections in Russia, including a business relationship with Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</span>Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, told prosecutors that, as soon as Manafort joined the campaign, he had asked Gates to prepare memos describing his elevated new role for Deripaska and three leading Ukrainian politicians. Emails show Manafort tried to get a message to Deripaska to offer him private briefings about Trump’s effort. Manafort told investigators he never gave Deripaska such briefings.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Manafort’s liaison to the Russian aluminum magnate was his own longtime Russian employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI had assessed had ties to Russian intelligence, according to the special counsel.
</span>The report said Manafort also provided campaign polling data to Kilimnik, described to him a strategy to win the election for Trump by contesting traditionally Democratic-leaning Midwestern states and discussed with him a pro-Russian peace plan for Ukraine, a top foreign policy goal of the Kremlin. Manafort would later say he understood Trump’s sign-off, if elected, would be necessary to advance the plan.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Manafort’s cooperation meant prosecutors finally had a firsthand witness who could explain whether there was ever a suggestion of a trade-off: Russian assistance in the campaign in exchange for a Trump administration that supported pro-Russian policies.

He also appeared twice before the grand jury.
But, prosecutors alleged, he did not tell them everything he knew. A federal judge agreed, ruling in February that Manafort had lied intentionally to prosecutors, particularly about his interactions with Kilimnik.
“It’s part of a pattern of requiring the Office of Special Counsel to pull teeth — withholding facts if he can get away with it,” U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during a February hearing.
In an email to The Washington Post last week, Kilimnik denied he had Russian intelligence ties and said he had not shared the polling information with anyone else. He said he had “absolutely . . . zero” to do with Russian interference.
Meanwhile, several prosecutors on Mueller’s team were pursuing another intriguing subject: Stone, a decades-old friend of Trump who had worked briefly for the celebrity mogul’s campaign <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span> then continued to informally advise him.

During the campaign, Stone egged on WikiLeaks as the London-based group leaked materials prosecutors say were provided by Russian operatives to help elect Trump. Starting in early <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> Stone began bragging publicly that he had a way to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
On Aug.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>— six weeks before WikiLeaks published emails stolen from Podesta — Stone tweeted, “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.”
The seemingly prescient and imperfectly phrased tweet did not mention WikiLeaks. But it led to suspicions by Podesta and others that Stone had been aware of WikiLeaks’ plans in advance.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">For months, Mueller’s team sought to understand whether Stone shared information about WikiLeaks’ activities with the campaign, uncovering numerous examples of Trump’s deep interest in the Clinton emails.
</span>At one point, during a drive to LaGuardia Airport, Trump told senior campaign official Gates that “more releases of damaging information would be coming,” Gates later told prosecutors.
Some in Trump’s orbit appeared to view Stone as having a hand in WikiLeaks’ activities. One person affiliated with a Trump campaign aide sent Stone a text message just after WikiLeaks published Podesta’s emails on Oct.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.</span> “Well done,” read the message, according to Stone’s eventual indictment, which did not identify the sender.
[Roger Stone was in close contact with Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, indictment shows]
After the election, Stone vociferously and repeatedly denied that he had been in contact with Assange or had any heads-up about WikiLeaks’ plans. He said that he never discussed WikiLeaks with Trump and that his claims during the campaign were just boasts and exaggerations.
Likewise, in written answers prepared by his attorneys, Trump told prosecutors he did “not recall discussing WikiLeaks” with Stone or being aware of Stone discussing the subject with others on his campaign, according to the report.
In <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2017,</span> Stone testified to the House Intelligence Committee that his public hints about WikiLeaks were based on vague tips he’d been given by a New York City radio host and comedian named Randy Credico, whom he described as an “intermediary” and “mutual friend” of Assange.
Credico has denied serving as a back channel for Stone. He said he didn’t become acquainted with Assange until the WikiLeaks founder appeared on his radio show on Aug.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> Stone began talking publicly about having a line to WikiLeaks weeks earlier.
Did Stone have another source? Prosecutors wanted to find out.
They brought Credico — along with his small white therapy dog Bianca — to Washington to testify before the grand jury. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">They interviewed Kristin Davis, a close Stone friend once known as the “Manhattan Madam” because she used to run a prostitution business catering to wealthy New Yorkers.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They issued a subpoena to Stone’s business assistant and held him in contempt of court when he refused to testify.
</span>[How an ex-madam, a political trickster and a toddler got tangled up in the Russia investigation]
They then turned their attention to Corsi, a conservative author who had emailed with Stone about WikiLeaks during the campaign.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Corsi,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72,</span> had at one point worked in financial services, but more recently had become a popular writer on the fringe right.</span> He wrote a book <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004 accusing</span> former secretary of state John F. Kerry of lying about his Vietnam service and then became a leading proponent of the false theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, a topic over which he bonded with Trump.
On Aug.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 28,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> two FBI agents banged on the door of Corsi’s New Jersey home, a grand jury subpoena in hand — kicking off a byzantine turn in the investigation.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">After convening with Gray, a New Jersey attorney who had done legal work for his wife’s cleaning business, Corsi decided he would cooperate with prosecutors.</span> He agreed to turn over his computers and passwords to his social media accounts and to sit for voluntary interviews.
But Corsi’s first meeting in September with prosecutors Zelinksy, Andrew Goldstein and Jeannie Rhee went quickly awry, Gray said in an interview with The Post.
Asked if he’d had anything to do with WikiLeaks during the campaign, Corsi issued a blanket denial. He claimed that he had told Stone during the campaign that trying to contact Assange was a bad idea that could subject them both to investigation, according to a draft court filing.
That wasn’t accurate.
By then, prosecutors had obtained emails showing that Corsi was in constant conversation with his friends and contacts, including Stone, throughout the final months of the campaign, speculating about Assange’s next moves, according to Gray.
On July<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>— a few days after WikiLeaks upset the Democratic National Convention by publishing internal Democratic Party emails — Stone emailed Corsi and asked him to get to Assange and find out what else the WikiLeaks founder held, according to a draft plea agreement Corsi released.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Corsi forwarded Stone’s note to Ted Malloch, an American author living in London who hoped to land a job with Trump and was eager to curry favor with his campaign, according to the draft filing.
</span>According to the report, Malloch told prosecutors he never tried to reach Assange, who was living at the Ecuadoran Embassy. He declined to comment.
Eight days later, Corsi sent Stone an email hinting he had managed to pick up new intelligence on Assange: “Word is friend in embassy <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">plans 2 more</span> dumps.” He predicted one of WikiLeaks’ publications would come in October and referenced Podesta, according to the draft filing: “Time to let more than Podesta to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC.”
[Corsi provided early alert to Stone about WikiLeaks release, according to draft special counsel document]
Corsi has said he was never in direct or indirect contact with Assange. He said he was exaggerating his knowledge to Stone.
“I’m convinced my memory is correct that I didn’t have a source that connected me to Assange,” he told The Post in November. “I really don’t think so.”
But prosecutors used his initial assertion that he declined Stone’s request to seek information from WikiLeaks as a cudgel, saying he could be charged with a crime for lying, Corsi described in a book he wrote about the experience called “Silent No More” that was published in December.
They pressed him to explain: Did he ever reach Assange? Did he tell Stone in advance that WikiLeaks had Podesta’s emails? Did he and Stone help WikiLeaks time the releases for maximum impact?
Gray said that he believed Corsi was trying to be honest, but he acknowledged his client’s answers were not always clear or consistent.
He said he decided to share details from Corsi’s sessions with prosecutors — including reading to The Post from contemporaneous notes — to try to help the public better understand how the clash between the special counsel’s office and witnesses like Corsi frustrated and extended the investigation.
Corsi, he noted, had sold thousands of books and built a fan base by cherry-picking facts to craft a desired narrative. For Corsi, this wasn’t lying, but salesmanship, picking “truthful facts woven in a way that you don’t have to worry about the things that are inconsistent,” Gray said.
The deeply fact-based prosecutors struggled to make sense of the conspiracy theorist and his evolving testimony.
“It’s their biggest nightmare,” Gray said. “The supposed best of the best were just frankly dumbfounded by the whole situation.”
Over sessions in September and October, Corsi offered information that appeared enticing but sketchy.
Corsi claimed he had figured out on his own in early August<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>that WikiLeaks had Podesta’s emails. According to the report, Corsi told Malloch in August or September that WikiLeaks would be releasing Podesta’s emails and then the Trump campaign would be” in the driver’s seat.”
Corsi also told prosecutors he alerted Stone that Podesta’s emails were coming and believed Stone’s “barrel” tweet was based on his information, Corsi has said.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">He claimed he and Stone had then crafted a “cover story” after the tweet to avoid tipping people off to their information — a research memo Corsi submitted to Stone with information about John and his brother Tony Podesta’s business ties to Russia.
</span>Stone told Congress that conversations he’d had with Corsi about the memo were the basis for his tweet, even though the memo was dated Aug.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 days</span> after he posted his message on Twitter about Podesta.
Gray said prosecutors appeared skeptical of Corsi’s claim that he had merely divined on his own that WikiLeaks would be releasing Podesta’s emails after determining that they were not included in the cache of the Democratic Party emails the group released in July. (Podesta, after all, did not work for the DNC, and his emails were not kept on the party committee’s servers.)
Over and over, they asked Corsi who had told him WikiLeaks held Podesta’s emails and whether he’d communicated with Assange. At one meeting, Gray said Corsi seemed to concede another person might have “planted a seed” in his mind about what WikiLeaks held. Then he said that “maybe he heard it from somewhere,” Gray said.
“His answer had morphed a bit. It was concerning to me, and it was concerning to the prosecutors,” he said.
In his book, Corsi insisted the prosecutors confused and rattled him with their repetitive questioning. At one point, he said he told the trio: “It frustrates me that I can’t remember . . . Sometimes I can’t tell if I remembered or invented.’”
Corsi told The Post in an interview last week: “I did not go in to lie or deceive them.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“I told them from the beginning that I couldn’t remember my<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>conversations with the kind of precision they were going to demand,” he said, adding: “I’m not a human tape recorder.”
</span>The group spent long hours in a windowless conference room, with the three prosecutors and half a dozen FBI agents arrayed on one side of the table and Gray and Corsi on the other.
At one point, Gray recalled that his eyes wandered to a whiteboard that covered one wall of the room. It appeared to have been only recently erased from an earlier meeting, and he could just barely make out what had been written there previously:
“Ukraine” it said faintly, underlined three times, an apparent reference to Manafort’s interviews, which were underway during that period. Beneath that were dollar figures tallying into the tens of millions.
Among Corsi’s claims to prosecutors, according to Corsi’s book: that Stone had given him advance notice on Oct.<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span></span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span> that The Post would be publishing a video in which Trump could be heard coarsely bragging about groping women.
Corsi said Stone had urged him to reach Assange and get him to release whatever he’d been holding back to counter the damaging video.
About a half-hour after The Post published a story about the video, WikiLeaks did, in fact, post the first tranche of thousands of Podesta emails.
If there was evidence that Stone played a role in the timing of the Podesta release, it would support the case that there was a conspiracy.
Stone has denied knowing anything about the tape in advance or playing a role in the timing of the Podesta release.
Corsi also told investigators that he believed he had played a role in getting WikiLeaks to release the Podesta emails — though he offered conflicting accounts about how he might have done so, according to the report.
Looking for corroborating evidence, with Corsi’s help, prosecutors constructed a detailed timeline of Corsi’s emails and phone calls in that period. They sought out Corsi’s contacts, looking for anyone who could be a go-between to WikiLeaks.
On Oct.<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> an FBI agent accompanied by a local sheriff’s deputy knocked on the back gate of the home of James and Joanne Moriarty in the Piney Woods, a rural region of eastern Texas.
The couple had lived in Libya before <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 fall</span> of ruler Moammar Gaddafi and had served as sources for Corsi as he worked on articles about what he felt were the failures of the Obama administration in that country.
In the days leading up to the Oct.<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span></span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span> WikiLeaks release, they communicated several times with Corsi about an article he was writing for the right-wing online outlet World Net Daily, James Moriarty told The Post.
Moriarty said he and his wife greeted the FBI agent coldly, first complaining that they did not see the agent as “any kind of good person” because he had come to their home wearing a weapon under his suit jacket.
Moriarty said they then spent three hours telling the agent about their experience in Libya, where he said they were detained by militants, and how they believed they had been relentlessly targeted by the U.S. government since they returned to Texas.
“The invasion of terrorists into the United States is real and present,” Moriarty said. “I told him about this and I told him that, now that he knows, he has to pass it along to other government agencies, including the White House, or he will be guilty of felonious acts.”
Moriarty said he and his wife ultimately consented to be interviewed. The agent spoke to them separately for a total of <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span></span>. They both told the agent they had not connected Corsi to Assange.
The dead end in the Piney Woods was typical.
According to Mueller’s report, investigators could find “little corroboration” for Corsi’s claim that Stone had urged him to help spur the Podesta email release.
In one interview, Corsi suggested he might have publicly tweeted a message that he thought Assange would read.
“Our Office was unable to find evidence of any such tweets,” Mueller wrote.
Gray said the frustration of the prosecution team became obvious. At one meeting, Rhee, a former partner at the prominent law firm WilmerHale, began to raise her voice as Corsi insisted he clearly remembered a conversation he had with Malloch a few months earlier, but not a key conversation he had shortly afterward with Stone.
“That was six months ago,” she said, according to Gray’s notes.
“We find what you’re saying is lacking,” Zelinsky added.
By their final meeting on Nov.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> the prosecutors made their concerns clear. They lectured Corsi for <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span></span> about the need to stick to definite facts.
Then they started in again: Were you a source about WikiLeaks for Roger Stone?
Corsi, who had grown increasingly uncomfortable as the prosecutors spoke, had trouble answering clearly.
After about five minutes, the prosecutors declared they were done, Gray said.
By the end, Mueller’s team had uncovered a wide array of contacts between Trump’s orbit and Russia — contradicting post-election claims from Trump’s representatives that there had been none.
They did not find a crime to charge.
According to the report, prosecutors concluded that Page had formed relationships with Russian intelligence officials before the campaign and that he may have been targeted in<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>by Russian officials because of his Trump campaign tie. They had trouble nailing down everything he did in Moscow during a July<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>visit, they wrote.
But the investigation did not establish he coordinated with the Russian effort in<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> After the report’s release, Page said he was not surprised, calling his Russia interactions a “big nothingburger.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Mueller’s team also analyzed whether Trump Jr.’s meeting with the Russian lawyer broke campaign finance law prohibiting foreign contributions.</span> They determined they would not be able to prove it did. They also said they could find no connections between the meeting and other Russian efforts to interfere in the election.
Investigators struggled to determine the motive of Manafort’s contacts with Kilimnik, interactions that went “very much to the heart” of the special investigation, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in a court hearing in February.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">[How Manafort’s<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>meeting with a Russian employee at New York cigar club goes to ‘the heart’ of Mueller’s probe]
They were hampered by not only his lies, according to the report, but his use of encrypted messaging apps.</span> Mueller ultimately did not find sufficient evidence to prove that Manafort or any other Trump associate acted as an agent of the Russian government.
Stone is scheduled to go on trial in November for lying to Congress, obstructing an official proceeding and witness tampering over allegations he attempted to intimidate Credico.
Key details about his case were redacted from the report because of a gag order imposed by the judge, which has also limited what Stone can say in his defense. He is, however, selling T-shirts to fund his legal defense that read, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong!”
It is not clear why Mueller’s team did not file the false-statement charges they threatened against Corsi. Much of the report dealing with their interactions with him has also been redacted by the attorney general, citing possible harm to an ongoing investigation. The report does not specify whether the redactions are related to Stone’s case or other continuing matters.
Corsi said last week that the experience showed the probe was a “fraud from the start.” He said only a “criminal” would urge him to plead guilty to charges that could not be proved in court.
Gray said he believes it would be inappropriate to charge Corsi because he has a faulty memory and noted that prosecutors gave him extensive opportunities to amend their answers.
“They pushed and pushed,” he said. “But at the end of the day, they threw up their hands and said, ‘We can’t use any of this.’ ”

Investors generally assume the U.S. government would bail out the companies in a crisis.

93723,"<h3>Stand With Us!</h3>Owners Challenge Zoning to Make Room for Adult Children, Elderly Parents

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 9</span>:29 pm ET

Junior's living in the basement. Mom and Dad put a tenant in the garage. And now Grandma's moving in. But packing them in like that isn't always legal.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The suburban single-family home is becoming a misnomer as economic reality collides with shifting demographics.

</span>Many suburban communities have long made it difficult, or impossible, for homeowners to convert underused space—barns, garages and basements—into rental apartments. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But across the U.S., homeowners are pressing for changes in zoning laws to allow rentals while home builders report a rise in demand for houses with in-law suites or quarters with separate entry.

</span>""There's a change at both ends,"" said Dean Palos, the director of planning in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City, which is exploring allowing multiple dwellings in one house. ""College graduates are going home to live, parents who are aging want to downsize. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">People see this as an economical way to take advantage of the property they have.</span>""

For decades, many suburban communities have discouraged renting out space in single-family homes, citing concerns including traffic, parking and stress on utilities.

Six years ago, Johnson County considered but ultimately didn't pass a measure to allow so-called accessory units. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But with both the job and housing markets struggling to recover, ""now they are far more sympathetic,"" Mr. Palos said of the county planning commissioners.</span> At least half a dozen recent meetings have been devoted to the issue.

One of five college graduates, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 25 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34,</span> is living with his or her parents, according to the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, the number of shared households—meaning an adult not enrolled in school living with another adult who isn't a spouse—<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 11.4% between</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2007 and</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 19.7 million</span> households <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 22 million</span>, the Census reported last month. Yet the number of households grew <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.3% during</span> the period.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">That number has stagnated as families double up and college graduates accept lower-wage jobs, unable to rent a place of their own.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Economists in part blame the slow recovery of the housing sector on young people who aren't setting up house on their own.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The brunt of America's detached single-family homes—<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 41.9 million</span>, or more than half—are in the suburbs, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies; cities and rural areas comprise the rest.

</span>The rise in shared households challenges the ideals upon which American suburbs were built, including ample space for families, their homes and their cars. But as baby boomers who raised families in the suburbs now age there, many don't want to sell their homes—or can't.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">""People are occupying housing that is three to four times what they need,"" said Patrick Hare, a longtime advocate for and author of books about accessory housing.</span> ""If you take all that surplus space, it can be utilized for accessory apartments.""

That's the calculation that prompted Richard Lacroix, a retired engineer, to ask the town of Arlington, Mass., a Boston suburb, to change local zoning to allow homeowners to create and rent out accessory apartments. He has lived in his four-bedroom home <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1971 and</span> saw an exodus of longtime neighbors because they couldn't afford to stay. He wanted to convert his garage into a studio apartment.

""I <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">am 73 years</span> old,"" he said. ""They should let people age in place. The town is looking to a substantial increase in property taxes."" In May, the proposal was defeated in a town meeting. Mr. Lacroix, who prepared and presented a 17-page report on the merits of accessory units, says he plans to raise the issue again. His annual property taxes <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are $8,000,</span> and he says they are only going up. ""It's just a matter of staying ahead,"" he said.

Zoning definitions and allowances for such rentals vary by locality. Some towns forbid the construction of kitchens or full bathrooms in areas of a home that could be rented out. Others have allowed multiple units for decades as long as one portion is occupied by a homeowner and there is adequate off-street parking and utility capacity.

The real-estate data firm Reis Inc. reported this month that U.S. apartment vacancy rates are at their lowest point in a decade, and that rents were at record levels in more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 90% of</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 82 markets</span> it tracks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists say the tight rental market is forcing many people to consider alternatives that in better times were largely dismissed—such as a room in a single-family home.

</span>""In some markets, like Washington, New York, San Francisco, [people] can't rent something in the areas they want to rent and they don't want to commute two hours away. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""This may be making some communities more open to rentals and to think about housing more broadly than they have.</span>""

Builders of new homes are responding to the new extended American family—and their homes. Last year, Lennar Corp. rolled out a ""Next Gen"" model, calling it a ""home within a home."" The houses feature a completely separate unit—with own entry, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living area—attached to the main house with a double door similar to adjoining hotel rooms.

""We can't build them fast enough,"" said Jeff Roos, president for Lennar's west region. ""People want to live together but not on top of each other."" He said the houses are attracting primarily families who use the extra unit for their grown children or elderly parents; as a result, the builder hasn't faced much resistance from municipalities worried about rentals, he said.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">In areas where the units are offered, which include Arizona, California and Nevada, the company <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">says 40% of</span> sales are Next Gen homes.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The homes range <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1,800 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,000 square</span> feet, and they are priced from the <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">low $200,000s</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $500,000.</span>

</span>But constructing accessory units in existing homes is drawing ire. The planning board in Montgomery County, Md., has asked the county council to consider a measure to allow conversions without homeowners going through a public hearing. Still, homeowners worry about strained public utilities, schools and even the availability of parking spaces. They say illegal conversions have been a problem for some time now.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">""This is a good way to supplement income on a fixed income like retirees,"" said Valerie Berton, spokeswoman for the planning department.</span> ""People would much prefer to see this than see foreclosures happening.""

""They act as boarding houses without any legal review,"" said Carol Petzold, who lives in Montgomery County and is a board member of the Aspen Hill Civic Association. ""An occasional accessory apartment in a neighborhood is one thing, but when they pile up, there's not enough room on our residential streets for all their vehicles.""

For tenants, such aesthetics likely won't matter. ""At some level, you're looking for additional rental housing anywhere you can find it,"" <span id=""9"" class=""red"">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span>

46093,"<h3>Analysis | The Daily 202: The political wars over vaccine passports are just getting started</h3>The White House is moving to soothe privacy and equity concerns about the development and deployment of so-called “vaccine passports” that would enable the bearer to prove they’ve been inoculated against the coronavirus.
And the administration is trying to strike a balance about the government’s role by declaring the private sector will lead the effort to design the certificates while also promising federal oversight to ensure citizens are treated fairly.
“We recognize this is a tricky and important subject, but the core here is that Americans, like people around the world, who are vaccinated will want to be able to demonstrate that vaccination in various forms,” said Andy Slavitt, White House senior adviser on the pandemic response.
The debate in the United States over whether and how to develop the “passports” — and to what extent states or businesses could require them — reflects the global disarray on the issue. The European Union is pushing ahead with its version (the “Digital Green Certificate”), Israel is struggling to implement its “Green Passport,” and Japan and China are deploying their own certificates.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">It also follows a year in which advice from experts on testing, mask-wearing, social distancing, economic lockdowns and vaccines turned into tests of partisan loyalties, with Republicans largely echoing Donald Trump’s public doubts about whether such steps were needed.</span> (Resistance to the vaccine today runs high among his supporters, and he only recently disclosed he’d had the shot and encouraged them to follow suit.)
Vaccine passports are the logical next political battleground.
On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a prominent supporter of the former president, decreed the Sunshine State’s borders closed to the idea.
“We are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Proponents say the certificates would provide peace of mind for employees at businesses like restaurants or bars and reassure everyone from air travelers to concert goers.
</span>An administration official, who requested anonymity to detail behind-the-scenes deliberations, said any passport roll-out was “weeks away.”
Concerns about the passports seem to run along two broad paths: Fears government will collect too much data on Americans, use it for purposes other than verifying vaccine status, and fail to safeguard the information — and worries underprivileged Americans who can’t get access to the vaccine will now effectively be punished for it.
Americans who don’t want to get vaccinated at all are obviously unlikely to embrace the certificates, either.
My colleague Paige Winfield Cunningham reports in The Health 202:
“To make passports widely usable, officials would need to create standards for the type of information they must maintain, convince issuers and holders to use the same app or set of apps and figure out how to provide a paper-based system for those who don’t have cellphones. Those are a lot of logistical challenges that would need to be undertaken in a short period of time.”
The Biden administration has moved to address some worries while trying to avoid steps that might inflame vaccine skepticism.
“There will be no centralized, universal federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki promised Monday at her daily briefing.
“Unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens,” Slavitt said. “We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do.”
As for equity, my colleagues Dan Diamond, Lena H. Sun and Isaac Stanley-Becker reported this weekend:
“The passports are expected to be free and available through applications for smartphones, which could display a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass. Americans without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, developers have said.”
As <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 1 in</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 Americans</span> did not have a smartphone.
“We'll leverage our resources to ensure that all vaccination credential systems meet key standards, whether that's universal accessibility, affordability, availability — both digitally and on paper,” Psaki said.
“It’s also important that we recognize that there are still many, many millions and millions of Americans that have not yet been vaccinated,” said Slavitt. “So that’s a fundamental equity issue.”
Slavitt also acknowledged the possibility that Americans hesitant to get vaccinated might become more so.
“We do know that there is a segment of the population that is concerned that the government will play too heavy-handed of a role in monitoring their vaccinations and that mandates will be coming from the federal government and important — in point of fact, it would discourage people to feel like that was the role we're playing,” he said.
What’s happening now
The murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin continued this morning with recollections from Donald Williams, a key witness. Williams can be heard on video of George Floyd’s death encouraging the officer to get off Floyd, Holly Bailey, Timothy Bella, Kim Bellware and Lateshia Beachum report. Williams testified that he could see Floyd “going through tremendous pain.” Williams said he felt like Floyd’s life was very much in danger before he died and that he was scared for his own safety.
Quote of the day
“The more that his knee was on his neck … the more you see Floyd fade away, slowly fade away,"" said Williams, who is considered a relevant witness because of the vantage point he had standing in proximity to Floyd and Chauvin.

- “A Black Lives Matter activist exposed the role two local police officers played in the Capitol insurrection. Their small town rapidly took sides,” by Kimberly Kindy: “[Bridgette Craighead] understands that her protests and social media posts have pushed to the surface racial and political tensions that have long gripped Rocky Mount — a three-hour drive from Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy. ‘They hate me for it,’ Craighead said. ‘They think I’m stirring things up, that there weren’t any issues until I brought them up. They are there. They don’t want to see them.’”
… and beyond
- “Two weeks after shooting spree, Georgia Senate backs bill to loosen gun restrictions,” by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Maya Prabhu: “House <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Bill 218 passed</span> 34-18 on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support of the measure. The fact that the vote came shortly after the spa shootings was something Democrats highlighted in opposing the bill. ‘We don’t have to live like this,’ said Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat.”
- “Group backed by Murdoch daughter-in-law targets primary elections as a 'threat to democracy,’ ” by Yahoo News’s Jon Ward: “Only <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span> of American voters choose about eight out <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 members</span> of Congress, says a new report out Tuesday from Unite America, a group that is pushing states to adopt nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. This small group — <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">this 10 percent</span> who make up primary voters in both parties — encourages extremism and gridlock rather than bipartisan cooperation, the report argues. … Unite America is more than an organization that puts out reports, however. … <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Kathryn Murdoch, a philanthropist with deep financial resources as the daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, donated <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $6 million</span> to the group <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 alone</span>.”
</span>- “The antiscience movement is escalating, going global and killing thousands,” by Scientific American’s Peter Hotez: “Facilitating the spread of COVID-19 is an expanded and globalizing antiscience movement that began modestly under a health freedom banner adopted by the Republican Tea Party in Texas. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Thousands of deaths have so far resulted from antiscience, and this may only be the beginning as we are now seeing the impact on vaccine refusal across the U.S., Europe and the low- and middle-income countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.”
</span>The <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 100 days</span>
Biden will today sign bipartisan legislation extending the Paycheck Protection Program.
- “The bill that Biden plans to sign in the Oval Office will extend the program through <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30.</span> It is currently set to expire on <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 31,</span>” John Wagner reports.
- An NPR-Marist poll found that Americans have given Biden better marks on his handling of the coronavirus than his handling of immigration. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Sixty percent approve of his job on the coronavirus, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 34 percent</span> approve of his job on immigration.</span> The poll comes as a growing number of Americans are getting vaccinated and thousands of migrants are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, Wagner notes.
- Satisfaction with the U.S. vaccine rollout surged <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 68 percent</span>, according to a new Gallup poll, doubling since January. “With more than a million Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines every day, the public's overall willingness to be inoculated against the disease has edged up three points. This continues the upward trajectory to a new high <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 74% since</span> hitting a low <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50% in</span> September.”
Congressional Democrats and the administration are considering lowering the Medicare eligibility age.
- “Democrats are still negotiating over which healthcare policy elements could be in the second of two spending programs the administration plans to unveil soon, according to congressional aides and industry groups,” the WSJ’s Stephanie Armour and Kristina Peterson report. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The package is likely to contain measures to reduce drug prices and expand health coverage, lawmakers said.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Proposals to expand Medicare eligibility from <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 65 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60 and</span> to enable the federal government to negotiate drug prices in the health program for seniors… are also likely to be included.”
- “The healthcare proposals would face opposition from many Republicans and hospital groups, who say they could reduce the labor force because more people may retire early.”
</span>Biden released his first slate of judicial nominees.
- With the batch <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 11 nominees</span>, the administration aims to boost diversity in federal courts nationwide, Ann Marimow and Matt Viser report.
- The list includes three Black women for appeals court vacancies: U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, often mentioned as someone who could become the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, was nominated to replace Attorney General Merrick Garland in the influential D.C. Appeals Court. Meanwhile, Tiffany P. Cunningham, a patent attorney in Chicago, was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a D.C.-based lawyer, was named to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
- The list also includes candidates that, if confirmed, would become the first Muslim American to serve on a District Court, the first Asian American woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit, and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge in Maryland.
- While Republicans will likely oppose some of the nominees, they all face easy confirmations if the Democratic caucus stays united. Our colleagues reported last month that the administration is following Trump’s practice to speed up the process by forgoing the American Bar Association review of candidates in advance of formal nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee could hold hearings on the nominations by late April.
Biden won’t throw the first pitch at the Nationals stadium this Opening Day.
- The D.C. baseball team invited Biden to Opening Day moments after the presidential race was called <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span></span> Today, the team said that Biden would not be coming to the stadium on Thursday but that he was welcome to throw out a first pitch sometime in the future, John Wagner and Chelsea Janes report.
- “Dating back to President William Howard Taft <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1910,</span> every U.S. president had thrown out a first pitch at some point in their presidency during years that Washington had a professional baseball team. That tradition ended with Trump,” our colleagues note.
The future of the GOP
Republicans, in a private call, acknowledged that Democrats’ expansive electoral reform bill is popular across the political spectrum.
- “In private, they concede their own polling shows that no message they can devise effectively counters the argument that billionaires should be prevented from buying elections,” writes the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer. “A recording obtained by The New Yorker of a private conference call on January 8th, between a policy adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell and the leaders of several prominent conservative groups — including one run by the Koch brothers’ network — reveals the participants’ worry that the proposed election reforms garner wide support not just from liberals but from conservative voters, too.”
- “The participants conceded that the bill, which would stem the flow of dark money from such political donors as the billionaire oil magnate Charles Koch, was so popular that it wasn’t worth trying to mount a public-advocacy campaign to shift opinion. Instead, a senior Koch operative said that opponents would be better off ignoring the will of American voters and trying to kill the bill in Congress.”
Florida Republicans are considering a new election bill that would ban giving voters water <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 150 feet</span> of polling places.
- “State law currently prohibits offering voters assistance <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 100 feet</span> of polling locations,” NBC News reports. The new bill “proposes expanding that zone <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 150 feet</span> and includes a prohibition on giving ‘any item’ to voters or ‘interacting or attempting to interact’ with voters within that zone.”
- The Florida bill would also “require voters to request mail ballots more frequently, add more identification requirements for mail voting, and limit how drop boxes are used.”
- “The [Florida] proposal is similar to a measure in Georgia’s sweeping new election law that bans giving water, food or gifts to voters waiting in line, among many other restrictions."" The Georgia measure mainly targets third-party activities, since poll workers can still set up self-serve coolers for voters.
Corporations are very vocal about racial justice. Voting rights, not so much.
- “Last week, as Georgia Republicans rushed to pass a sweeping law restricting voter access, Atlanta’s biggest corporations, including Delta, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, declined to weigh in, offering only broad support for voting rights. The muted response — coming from companies that last year promised to support social justice — infuriated activists, who are now calling for boycotts,” the New York Times’s David Gelles reports.
- “Companies have effectively squashed bills at the state level before. <span id=""7"" class=""red""><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> when lawmakers were advancing the bathroom bills, major corporations said they would move jobs out of states that adopted such measures,” Gelles notes.</span> “This time around, however, the entertainment industry has taken a more guarded approach. … The fight in Georgia is likely a preview of things to come. Lawmakers in dozens of states have proposed similar voting bills, and activists are planning to ramp up the pressure on corporate America as the battle over voting rights goes national.”
The Freedom Caucus is fretting over how far to push its rebellion.
- “A notable split has emerged inside the House Freedom Caucus in recent weeks over its members' use of delaying tactics on the floor to protest Democratic policies. That effort has grabbed attention and ruffled leadership, two hallmarks of the Freedom Caucus, but it's also snarled legislative proceedings enough to breed frustration among some members of the far-right crew,” Politico’s Olivia Beavers and Melanie Zanona report.
- “Some in the caucus criticize the legislative slowdown, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and several others, as a failure to act strategically. Conservatives should challenge a select few bills rather than a wide swath, these Republicans argue, to avoid diluting the potency of moments when they choose to tie the House in procedural knots … But other Freedom Caucus members feel strongly that wreaking havoc on the floor is part of their brand and they need to deploy every procedural weapon at their disposal.”
Today in history
President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt on this day <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span> “In the 70th day of his presidency, Reagan underwent three hours of surgery at George Washington University Hospital to remove the bullet that entered under his left armpit, struck his seventh rib and burrowed three iches into his left lung,"" reported The Post's David S. Broder. ""On his way into surgery, the president gamely reassured friends: 'Don't worry about me. I'll make it.'”
Hot on the left
An accused Capitol rioter was arrested in a T-shirt reading “I was there” with Trump’s photo and the date of the insurrection. “When police showed up at Garret Miller’s Dallas home earlier this year to arrest him on charges that he had participated in the Capitol riot, his wardrobe spoke for itself,” Katie Shepherd reports. “New details of his Jan.<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 arrest</span> were revealed this week in court documents as prosecutors urged a judge not to release him before his trial, noting that he allegedly admitted to bringing a gun into the Capitol during the deadly insurrection. Police also found an array of weapons and gear in Miller’s house, prosecutors said, including a grappling hook, ropes, body armor, night vision goggles, a crossbow and arrows, and multiple firearms with ammunition. … He also sent a selfie [during the attack] that showed him standing inside the Capitol Rotunda, according to court records, with the caption: ‘Just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol.’”
Hot on the right
Trump came after Tony Fauci and Deborah Birx after they both criticized his management of the pandemic response. Birx, who ran Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, told CNN a few days ago that she was “marginalized every day,” Diamond reports. “The majority of the people in the White House did not take this seriously,” she said. Fauci, meanwhile, lamented the “lost opportunity” when Trump chose to get vaccinated in private.

It is a similar story for oil prices, which many investors believe should rise if economic prospects are improving.</span> Instead, crude has swung in both directions following past rate cuts.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">As markets enter the second half <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019,</span></span> analysts and investors are closely watching the Fed, putting new emphasis on the central bank’s meeting at the end of the month.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">If the Fed lowers rates, it would mark its first rate cut <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008,</span> when it began embracing easy money after the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015,</span> but they still remain well below precrisis levels.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The possible change of course comes at a time when other global central banks are shifting toward easing monetary policy, just after they had begun tentatively stepping away from postcrisis policies.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Bets on lower rates helped push the S&<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 and</span> Dow industrials to fresh records last week, with indexes from the U.S. to Europe <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 15% or</span> more for the year.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Some analysts warn lower rates won’t support stocks and other risky investments if the economy slows markedly, as many investors expect, or morphs into a recession.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“There’s a lot of unfounded optimism that this recovery could be perpetually supported by fiscal and monetary policy,” says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus.</span> “That’s not indefinitely positive.”

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">So do economic conditions today look more like they did in the market-fueled downturns of the ’90s, or in the buildup to the housing crisis of 2007?

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some investors say current conditions are comparable to those surrounding Fed rate cuts <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995 and</span></span></span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1998,</span></span> when the central bank eased policy and a recession didn’t follow.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate is currently near its lowest level in almost five decades, and some analysts expect economic growth to slow from its first-quarter annual rate <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1% but</span> remain stable.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report Friday, investors this week will parse minutes from the Fed’s last meeting and figures on consumer prices to gauge the trajectory of U.S. growth.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Stubbornly soft inflation has also given some analysts confidence that the Fed will lower rates later this month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual testimony to Congress will also be in focus this week.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Another factor keeping investors optimistic: Interest rates still remain relatively low compared with historical levels.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Following the best first half of the year for the S&<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 since</span><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> analysts are also weighing whether investors are too optimistic about the effects of rate cuts.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Stocks have risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of a Fed rate cut later this month.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1995,</span> they also rallied before the Fed lowered rates, only to continue their run.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1998 rate</span> cut was preceded by sharp stock-market declines as the meltdown of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management nearly brought down the financial system.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Markets stabilized after the Fed cut rates.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red""><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2001,</span> stocks also slid before the central bank cut rates as the tech-stock bubble burst.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Some analysts say protectionist trade policies are muddying the economic outlook to such an extent that past interest-rate cycles aren’t comparable to the current period.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">An index measuring economic-policy uncertainty around the world created by professors at Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago climbed near its highest level ever last month.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Even if the Fed lowers rates, some analysts are skeptical business and consumer spending will pick up if the U.S.-China trade fight remains unresolved.</span> That could mean recent optimism driving stocks higher is misplaced, these analysts say.

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“It’s gone way too far,” says Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“If the Fed cuts and people don’t want to borrow because capital spending is frozen basically, what you end up with is a lot of money just sitting in the banks.”

</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">In one warning sign that the 10-year-old economic expansion could come to an end relatively soon, the gap between long- and short-term bond yields, known as the yield curve, turned negative earlier this year.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">A yield curve inversion has preceded the last several recessions, though they have often occurred well after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has dropped below the three-month yield in the past.

</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">There is also the issue of timing investments around Fed rate cuts.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">An analysis of similar periods during which the Fed cut rates after previously raising them by Toronto money manager Gluskin Sheff & Associates showed the S&<span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 returned</span><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22% on</span> average in the year following the last interest-rate cut of each cycle.

</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">The gap between the performance of stocks and the 10-year Treasury note was also much bigger following the final rate cut of each cycle than after the first time rates dropped, the analysis found.</span> Gluskin Sheff also included rate-cut periods starting <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span><span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1987 and</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989.</span>

<span id=""39"" class=""red"">“You want to resist the temptation at all costs to jump in after the first rate cut,” says David Rosenberg, the firm’s chief economist.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">“The stock market really differentiates itself the year after the last rate cut.”

37368,"<h3>Oil Prices Spike After Attack on Saudi Facilities but Lasting Disruption Seen Unlikely</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">HOUSTON — Oil prices rose <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span> on Monday as investors reacted to a weekend attack on one of Saudi Arabia’s most important oil facilities that could cripple petroleum exports for days or even weeks.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But experts say that a severe shock to energy markets and the world economy would be unlikely.
</span>The attack on the Abqaiq processing facility and another plant, deep in Saudi territory, displayed the vulnerability of the kingdom to tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The country produces <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span> of the world’s oil supplies. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia’s daily oil exports <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7.4 million</span> barrels by as much as three-quarters, taking <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 5 percent</span> of global supplies off the market, unless the facility is quickly repaired.
</span>President Trump suggested on Sunday that he could release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an attempt to calm oil markets. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Brent crude oil futures briefly spiked <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span>, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $11 a</span> barrel, when trading started on Monday and then eased to an increase of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span>, or just <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $6 a</span> barrel.
</span>The attack raised the possibility of further disruptions in Saudi Arabia’s oil production if there were additional attacks on its fields and pipelines.
The planned initial public offering of the kingdom’s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, could also be hurt if international investors doubt Saudi Arabia’s ability to defend its vital energy infrastructure.
But as luck would have it, the attack came as global oil stockpiles were higher than usual, several producing countries have ample spare capacity and American oil facilities have so far been spared from a damaging hurricane season. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, a slowing global economy has moderated energy demand.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We do not expect an immediate disruption on global oil trade, since many nations, including the U.S., have ample crude oil in storage,” said Manish Raj, chief financial officer of Velandera Energy Partners, a Louisiana oil exploration and production company.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The Saudis themselves have enough storage to meet their export obligation for the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 60 days</span>.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Therefore, we expect no supply-demand imbalance in the near term.”
</span>The main uncertainty is how long will it take for the Saudis to repair the Abqaiq facility, which separates gas from oil from several important oil fields. While the fire was put out quickly, the Saudis may not know the answer for days since the facility is large and has complex equipment that still needs to be tested.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Should the damage be fixed quickly, Eurasia Group, a risk consulting firm, estimates that oil prices could rise a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">modest $2 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $3 a</span> barrel, which would still leave the global benchmark Brent crude <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $65 a</span> barrel, relatively low by recent historical standards.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The firm estimated that a more long-lasting disruption could mean an increase <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $10 a</span> barrel, though that would still leave prices several dollars below where they were a year ago.
</span>Other analysts took a dimmer view, even as Saudi Aramco said on Sunday that repairs were already underway. The initial reaction of oil traders was panicky.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“The problem is that the attack is so significant, “ said Bill Farren-Price a director at RS Energy Group, a market research firm.</span> “It demonstrates that one of the best regional oil companies has difficulties defending itself from this new style of threat. That theme is going to endure. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">“

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">The United States and other developed countries have <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3 billion</span> barrels in stockpiles, according to the International Energy Agency, enough to take care of about two months of demand.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 million</span> barrels above a year ago, despite American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that have constricted their exports.

The developed countries and China have sizable strategic reserves as well in cases of emergency, although stockpiles have been declining in the United States and Europe in recent weeks.
Until this weekend, OPEC has been more concerned about oversupply than shortages.

55683,"<h3>A Movie Summer of Few Sure Things</h3>When it comes to box-office blockbusters, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 is</span> looking slim, raising questions for the next wave of would-be mega-franchises and hopes for the indies going up against them.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The movie business today is driven largely by a small number of pictures that achieve megahit status, often sucking all the oxygen out of the marketplace.
</span>Last year, four movies released during Hollywood’s summer season, which runs from May through August, grossed more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $850 million</span> world-wide: “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” Jurassic World,” “Inside Out” and “Minions.”
This summer, many in the movie industry believe, only two releases seem poised to reach those heights: May’s “Captain America: Civil War,” which despite its title is essentially a third “Avengers,” stuffed with nearly every superhero from the Marvel Studios pantheon; and June’s “Finding Dory,” a long-awaited follow-up to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2003 Pixar</span> hit “Finding Nemo.”
Memorial Day weekend’s “X-Men: Apocalypse” should also do very well, but no movie in that series has grossed more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $760 million</span>.
“It looks like this summer will not be nearly as strong as last summer,” said Josh Lynn, head of Piedmont Media Research. “Few, if any, films appear to have the potential to break out as hugely as ‘Jurassic’ or ‘Ultron” and most are in the expected middle range.”
A paucity of billion-dollar movies in the summer <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016 could</span> be good news for competitors that aren’t sequels or videogame adaptations. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When one movie does phenomenal business at the box office, it tends to take up every ounce of audience attention and cultural buzz, making it impossible for quirky, original films to find room to breathe.</span> “Jurassic World,” for instance, was widely blamed for the failure last June of two Sundance Film Festival award -winners, “Dope” and “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” that opened within a week of the mega-dino-hit.
If “Independence Day: Resurgence” doesn’t completely dominate the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4 time</span> frame, for example, there might be a shot for “Free State of Jones,” a Civil War drama starring Matthew McConaughey that is bravely opening against the alien-invasion sequel.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Other dramas and offbeat comedies aimed at adults that are opening against bigger-budget competition and include the Russell Crowe- Ryan Gosling 1970s spy comedy “The Nice Guys,” opening against “Angry Birds” and “Neighbors 2”; Woody Allen’s “Cafe Society,” which debuts against “Ghostbusters”; “Florence Foster Jenkins” with Meryl Streep vying with a “Pete’s Dragon” remake; and “The Founder,” starring Michael Keaton as the man who built McDonalds into an empire.</span> It will face off with “Suicide Squad.”-
Hollywood’s major studios, meanwhile, are hoping sequels to moderately successful movies or adaptations of long-in-the-tooth brands could morph into their next major franchises.
But is the world eager for a follow-up to Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland?” Or “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?” How about movies based on the videogames “World of Warcraft” and “Angry Birds,” that peaked in popularity a few years ago? Are “Independence Day” and “Ghostbusters,” last seen on the big screen <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> respectively, ready for a comeback similar to what “Jurassic World” pulled off last summer? Can “The Legend of Tarzan” reignite a franchise whose glory days were in the ‘30s?
If recent box-office returns are any indication, in most cases the answer will be no. Plenty of sequels have fizzled in recent months, such as “Snow White” follow-up “The Huntsman: Winter’s War,” the third “Divergent” and “<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Zoolander<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.</span></span>” <span id=""3"" class=""red"">While audiences love well-known titles—witness “The Jungle Book” —the market is so saturated with them that they are more a necessary condition for success than a guarantee.</span> (Animation remains the one genre in which originality regularly shines, as most recently evidenced by “Zootopia.”).
Even franchises that have long been solid have lost their footing. In the past, there was no question that the same people would turn out for each installment of “Harry Potter” or “Twilight,” which is why so many were shocked to see November’s fourth and final “Hunger Games” <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gross $55 million</span> less than No.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $144 million</span> less than No.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.</span> That makes <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 movies</span> that previously would have been sure things, like the fifth “Ice Age” or the 13th “Star Trek,” all of a sudden anything but.
Managing director Eric Handler of research firm MKM Partners is forecasting that box office returns will be down a <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hefty 7% between</span> April and June compared with the same period a year ago, though he believes the back half of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 will</span> fare somewhat better in comparison to last year. Buzz on the August DC Comics supervillain ensemble film “Suicide Squad,” for example, is better than that of last August’s superhero bomb “Fantastic Four.”
If the summer isn’t dominated by a handful of blockbusters, it’s not only upscale audiences who may find more to see at the multiplex. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There are also R-rated comedies looking to be the next “Trainwreck,” such as “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” and “Bad Moms”; low-budget horror flicks “The Shallows” and “Lights Out”; and the teen-girl tear-jerker “Me Before You,” which is, not coincidentally, opening on the same weekend where “The Fault In Our Stars” succeeded two years ago.

In a high-stakes video call, President Biden warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of “strong economic and other measures” from the U.S. and European allies if military tensions with Ukraine escalated.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, in a high-stakes virtual meeting on Tuesday morning, warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of economic consequences if he continued to escalate a military presence around Ukraine, according to a White House statement.
</span>The diplomatic effort came as tens of thousands of Russian troops mass along the Ukrainian border, raising fears of an invasion.
Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, described the president’s comments to reporters.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,” Mr. Sullivan said.
</span>He later added, “There was a lot of give and take, there was no finger wagging, but the president was crystal clear about where the United States stands.”
Mr. Sullivan said the administration was also prepared to send supplies and additional resources to Ukraine if Russia escalated its military presence.
Asked for specifics for the consequences facing Russia, Mr. Sullivan declined to go into detail. “I will look you in the eye and tell you as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today that things we did not do <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> we are prepared to do now,” Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the year Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Virtually no country has recognized the action, and Western powers continue to condemn Russia for it.
The U.S. and Russian leaders began their conversation via video-link at 10:07 a.m., according to the White House, and it ended at 12:08 p.m. According to the White House, they also discussed ransomware and issues related to Iran. Before the call, Biden officials said the discussion would cover nuclear arms control, cybersecurity and Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed to continue the dialogue on the issues discussed on Tuesday.
Mr. Biden would be speaking to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, on Thursday, Mr. Sullivan said.
In a brief video of the opening moments of the call released by Russian state television, Mr. Putin said, “Greetings, Mr. President!”
“Good to see you again,” Mr. Biden responded warmly, after what appeared to be a brief connection glitch. “Unfortunately, last time we didn’t get to see one another at the G20. I am hoping next time we meet we do it in person.”
The video showed Mr. Putin seated at a long wooden desk, with Mr. Biden on a large video screen in front of him, and he waved to Mr. Biden as the call began. Mr. Putin took the call from his residence in Sochi, the Russian resort city on the Black Sea.
After the call ended, Mr. Biden was expected to hold a separate call with multiple U.S. allies, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. The leaders had previously agreed to stay in contact on Russia’s deployment to Ukraine, according to the White House.
The virtual meeting with Mr. Putin was a crucial test for Mr. Biden, as he tried to protect Ukraine, a democratic ally whose security U.S. officials have promised to defend, and head off a major European security crisis.
Mr. Putin has complained that Ukraine poses a threat to Russia through its close military and political ties to the United States and European powers.
U.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin has not decided whether to invade Ukraine. But the United States has disclosed intelligence showing that Russia’s military has developed a war plan that envisions as many <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 175,000 troops</span> pouring across Ukraine’s border — an invasion force that Ukraine’s military, despite U.S.-provided equipment and training, would have little ability to stop.
Don’t call it a Zoom.
President Biden’s talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday relied on a secure communications process about which the Biden administration has very little to say: not about conducting the call, or the full list of participants, or how the contents of the call will be memorialized.
“As a general rule we would not talk about security measures or the logistics of the president’s calls with world leaders,” Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said.
But based on recent history — including details that emerged after a whistle-blower’s revelations about former President Donald J. Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 </span>— there are more than a few clues to piece together about the mechanics of the call.
Each White House organizes its calls differently, according to Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a former cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, and sometimes the protocol can vary from leader to leader. But a secure call essentially means the communication between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin would be encrypted.
“A lot of other intelligence services out there would love to know what conversation actually took place between the president of the U.S. and the president of Russia,” Mr. Daniel said in an interview. “You want to encrypt the bits as they’re flowing” from leader to leader.
To memorialize calls with foreign leaders, presidential administrations have relied on the so-called TNet system, a highly secure network that connects to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, a secure intranet system operated by the Defense Department. More sensitive files can be stored in an even more tightly controlled program, called NICE, for N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment: “You have a lot of control over what pieces of data that people can get to depending on their access,” Mr. Daniel added.
The calls are organized through the National Security Council, with the council’s executive secretary overseeing the logistics. Often, the president, working with the national security adviser, decides who will be present or able to listen in for the calls.
Mr. Biden’s side of the call was in the Situation Room, which is historically where presidents have hosted secure calls with other world leaders. Mr. Putin’s side was from his residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Tass, the state news agency.
The longstanding White House policy is to not record calls held in the Situation Room, according to Larry Pfeiffer, who served as a director of the Situation Room during the Obama administration. Instead, there is a transcription, which, he said, allows the White House “both a historical record that can be relied upon but allows for plausible deniability” if something unflattering were to leak. (The limits of transcription were exposed in some detail two years ago, in the aftermath of accusations that aides to then President Donald J. Trump mishandled the system to store a call with the Ukrainian president.)
Mr. Biden was solo onscreen when the call started, but it is common practice to have aides on hand listening to the call. Each would have a designated role. The Situation Room is equipped with voice-to-text translation software, and a note taker relies on that software to assemble an account of what the two leaders say. In this case, several experts said, a translator would also likely be present.
A subject-matter expert on the National Security Council is also generally present. That person looks over the material from the call, reviews and edits it based on their understanding of the foreign leader and current events, and then passes it along to the national security adviser.
Mr. Biden’s advisers say that the president believes that there are benefits to meeting face-to-face and in-person with a leader like Mr. Putin. But with mounting Russian aggression toward Ukraine and the threat of an invasion hanging in the balance, Mr. Biden did not have the luxury of travel time to practice his preferred in-person approach to diplomacy. On Tuesday, the day of their call, machine-gun fire and the flash of rocket-propelled grenades were reported along Ukraine’s border.
With Putin-Biden meeting, skirmishes break out between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military exchanged fire with Russian-backed separatists using machine guns and grenade launchers on Tuesday, the day on which President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia discussed ways to ease mounting tensions in the region.
While the skirmish was not unusual, it was a reminder that even as leaders in Moscow and Washington were engaging in high-stakes diplomatic negotiations, a war that has claimed thousands of lives over the past seven years showed no signs of abating.
A recent influx of Russian soldiers along the border with Ukraine has led to fears of a wider conflagration and the prospect that Russia might be planning an invasion of the eastern European nation.
The exchange of fire on Tuesday broke out at three locations along the so-called line of contact, a roughly 250-mile-long barricade of trenches and fortifications between Ukrainian soldiers and their opponents in a protracted war of attrition.
The Ukrainian side suffered no casualties, according to the press office of the Ukrainian armed services. It was unclear if the separatists had any losses. According to the Ukrainians, it was the separatists who fired first.
“Ukrainian defenders opened fire in response,” the press service said in a statement, “and forced the enemy to cease fire.”
Though such violence occurs almost daily in the region, in this period of explosive tension there are fears that an errant bullet or mortar shell could be all that is needed to touch off a serious escalation. Even when fired upon, Ukrainian soldiers are under strict orders not to respond unless absolutely necessary.
“This really annoys the soldiers, that we’re not allowed to respond,” said First Lt. Ivan Skuratovsky, of Ukraine’s 25th Airborne Brigade, which is deployed at the front in the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka.
Serious casualties on the front lines are uncommon these days, though a handful of Ukrainian soldiers are killed each month, usually by sniper fire. There were seven soldiers killed in September, two in October and six in November. Last week, a 22-year-old soldier named Valeriy Herovkin became the first killed in December.
As concern mounts over Russia’s menacing massing of troops on the Ukrainian border, many analysts say that the fate of the eastern European nation matters far more to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than to the Biden administration.
Mr. Putin speaks often about the former Soviet republic’s historical and ethnic ties to Russia, while President Biden has said his goal is to establish a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia.
But Mr. Putin, who raised similar alarms with a deployment near Ukraine this spring, has once again seized the attention of Washington. And he came to Tuesday’s meeting with demands of his own, including his insistence that NATO forswear the possibility of making Ukraine a member of the alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have countered that Moscow cannot dictate the foreign policy choices of other nations.
Even if he does not plan to invade Ukraine, Mr. Putin may be wagering that Mr. Biden’s preoccupation with matters like the coronavirus pandemic and competition with China will make him inclined to strike a deal.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Seen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin’s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kyiv or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine,” Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in an analysis published on Monday.
</span>“Rather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin’s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs,” Mr. Samorukov added. For Mr. Putin, any moves by Ukrainian leaders to draw closer to the West are an affront.
Complicating matters for Mr. Biden is European uncertainty about how to handle Mr. Putin’s newest threats. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">European nations are dependent on Russia for much of their energy supplies, and their economies stand to suffer if relations with Russia deteriorate further.
</span>The Biden administration has been negotiating with European leaders in an effort to unify around which punishments could be inflicted on Russia for any new aggression.
The first time that President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia encountered each other in a leader-to-leader summit, it was on a sunny day last June at an estate on Lake Geneva — and the meeting was dominated by ransomware attacks on the United States, rather than the specter of an invasion of Ukraine.
Mr. Biden had, weeks before, agreed with the characterization of Mr. Putin as a “killer.” Mr. Putin denied that Russia was behind a remarkably broad breach of American corporate and government computer networks — the “Solar Winds” attack which was discovered a year ago, just as Mr. Biden was preparing to take office — traced to one of Russia’s premier intelligence agencies.
“We want a stable, predictable relationship,” Mr. Biden said going into the summit, an acknowledgment that the heady days of the 1990s, when there was talk of Russia joining Europe (and maybe, eventually, even NATO) were gone forever, and that the best that could be hoped for was good communications.
The Geneva meeting was tense. “I did what I came to do,’’ Mr. Biden said after the meeting, including laying out a series of warnings and red lines for the Russian leader, which he insisted were not “threats.” “I think the last thing he wants now is a Cold War.”
Mr. Putin called Mr. Biden “constructive, well-balanced and experienced,” and said he wanted agreements on “rules of behavior” on sensitive subjects like nuclear weapons and cybersecurity — an echo of American officials’ hopes of finding “guardrails” for the U.S.-Russian relationship.
Mr. Biden emerged offering some modest optimism that the United States, by restoring its alliances in Europe, had made Mr. Putin more cautious about any actions regarded as being against Western interests.
For a few months it looked like something was getting done. Led by Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, talks began on “strategic stability,” the diplomatic code words for managing the nuclear arsenal — and, increasingly, space and cyberweapons — in ways that do not lead to accidental war or unnecessary military escalation. Another set of conversations, quiet and private, took place between Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and her Russian counterpart. Ransomware attacks continued, the F.B.I. reported, but nothing that seemed threatening to critical infrastructure.
But in October and November, just as the administration was promoting modest progress, satellite photographs began to appear on desks around Washington showing a major buildup of forces around Ukraine. The administration sent William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former American ambassador to Russia, to send a warning.
Apparently, the message didn’t get through.
AVDIIVKA, Ukraine — Machine-gun fire broke the stillness just <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 8 p</span>.m. when Capt. Denis Branitskii was midway through the evening patrol. The shots came in sporadic bursts and were close by, fired by Russian-backed separatists whose positions were obscured in the darkness. Only when the flash of a rocket-propelled grenade illuminated the newly fallen snow did Captain Branitskii break his stride, briefly pausing to take cover before moving on.
“This happens every night,” said Captain Branitskii, a cleft-chinned company commander with the Ukrainian military’s 25th Airborne Brigade, positioned along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. “Sometimes it’s much heavier, sometimes it’s like tonight. Tonight, this is fine.”
This is the scene on the front lines right now, ahead of a phone call on Tuesday between President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at staving off a far more serious military escalation. After eight years of war, few in Ukraine believe the call will lead to an immediate breakthrough that might spare their country further violence.
“I wouldn’t expect a breakthrough,” said Dmitry Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, according to the Interfax news agency. “Putin will hear very clear signals from President Biden about what Ukraine’s partners will do if Putin comes head with a military operation against our country.”
Mr. Kuleba said that following the call, Mr. Biden would speak with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
So far, soldiers on the front lines said they had seen little evidence of escalation beyond a largely slow-moving war of attrition that set in after both sides fought to a stalemate over territory seized by Russian-backed forces <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Compared with the vicious fighting that preceded it, this is a holiday, several soldiers said.
On Monday, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Ukrainian armed forces, Mr. Zelensky donned a helmet and flak jacket and visited the troops on the front lines. He later announced that Ukraine’s frontline brigades would soon be getting new weapons systems including modernized tanks and armored personnel carriers. He also announced that Ukraine had signed a deal with Britain to build a new fleet of gunboats and purchase new anti-mine ships.
The Ukrainian military has made significant progress <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2014,</span> when it nearly disintegrated in the face of a lightning operation by Russian forces to seize territory, first by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then by fomenting a separatist takeover in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Ukrainian troops have since fought alongside NATO forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and trained with American military advisors.
But few believe that Ukraine’s military could hold out for long against a full-on Russian invasion. Some military analysts have said that, at most, Ukraine would at best manage an organized retreat.
If a full-on attack comes, Ukrainian forces are as ready to face it as they’ve ever been, said Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, commander of the Joint Forces Operation battling the separatists. But even this, he acknowledged, would not be enough to hold off the Russian military without significant assistance from Western countries, specifically the United States.
“This is a beast who has tasted blood,” General Pavlyuk said. “Believe me, the losses are going to be horrible on both sides — thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. On their side and ours.”
As vice president during the Obama administration, Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the lead role in managing America’s relationship with Ukraine as it fended off Russian aggression.
Now, as president, Mr. Biden is making a dramatic effort to rescue the country from the gravest threat it has faced in decades, by trying to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia not to mount the invasion that U.S. officials say he is planning.
President Barack Obama gave Mr. Biden the Ukraine portfolio in his second term, after Ukraine’s Russia-backed president was ousted in a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014 popular</span> revolution. Mr. Putin considers the pro-Western leadership that came in at that time both an affront and a security threat.
In the following years, Mr. Biden visited Ukraine a half-dozen times, forging relationships with politicians and activists. After Mr. Putin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and fomented rebellion in the country’s east, Mr. Biden declared “the unwavering support of the United States of America and the American people” for Ukraine.
“It is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of freedom-loving people the world over are with you because so much rides on your fragile experiment with democracy succeeding,” Mr. Biden said in a <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015 speech</span> to Ukraine’s Parliament.
“I was the point man for our administration on the crisis, which was exactly where I wanted to be,” Mr. Biden later wrote in a memoir. He scoffed at critics who predicted that Ukraine would amount to a defeat for the West at Mr. Putin’s hands, one that would haunt him politically. “I didn’t much care. There was an important principle at stake: Big countries ought not to beat up smaller ones,” he wrote.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden’s engagement did bring a political cost: It would expose him to political attacks — frequently in exaggerated and distorted terms — by Donald J. Trump and his allies over his son Hunter’s lucrative work for a Ukrainian energy company.
</span>At times as vice president, Mr. Biden pressed Mr. Obama — who was reluctant to be drawn into mutual escalation with Mr. Putin in Russia’s back yard — to provide Ukraine with more support, like anti-tank Javelin missiles.
But in the memoir, Mr. Biden also recalls agreeing with Mr. Obama that there was only so much the United States could promise to a country whose importance to America is hard to distill.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The president and I agreed that we could and should convince our European allies to support and extend serious economic sanctions against Russia.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But economic sanctions were as far as the United States and its allies in Europe would go,” he wrote.
</span>Ahead of Tuesday’s videoconference, the Kremlin has been signaling one core conviction: Russia cares more about Ukraine’s fate than the West ever will.
In speeches, interviews and lengthy articles, President Vladimir V. Putin and his close associates have telegraphed a singular fixation in recent months on the former Soviet republic. The Kremlin thesis goes that Ukrainians are “one people” with Russians, living in a failing state controlled by Western forces determined to divide and conquer the post-Soviet world.
Ukrainians, who ousted a Russia-friendly president <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> are increasingly in favor of binding their country to Western institutions, would largely beg to differ. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But Mr. Putin’s conviction finds a receptive ear among many Russians, who see themselves as linked intimately with Ukraine by generations of linguistic, cultural, economic, political and family ties.</span> Now, with a force <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 175,000 Russian</span> troops poised to be in position near Ukraine by early next year, in what Western officials fear could be a prelude to an invasion, centuries of shared history loom large.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Putin’s gambit may be a cold calculus of coercion — a way to force President Biden to recognize a Russian sphere of interest in Eastern Europe.</span> But to Mr. Putin, and many other Russians, the nearly eight-year-old conflict with Ukraine is not simply about geopolitics; it is about a hurt national psyche, a historical injustice to be set right. A former Kremlin adviser, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, describes the Kremlin’s view of Ukraine as a “trauma wrapped in a trauma” — the dissolution of the Soviet Union coupled with the separation of a nation Russians viewed as an extension of their own.
“One of the colossal problems pushing us into conflict is that Russian identity does not exist without Ukrainian identity,” said Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Parliament who was the only lawmaker to vote against the Crimea annexation and later fled to Ukraine.
While other conflicts in the post-Soviet world have pitted one ethnic group against another, the one between Russia and Ukraine is more complicated. Ukrainian is Ukraine’s official language, but Russian — which is closely related — is still widely spoken. Russians often view Kyiv, now the Ukrainian capital and once the center of the medieval Kyivan Rus, as the birthplace of their nation. Russian-language writers like Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov came from Ukraine, as did the Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, now speaks Ukrainian in public but first gained fame as a Russian-language comedian who performed across the former Soviet Union.
To many Ukrainians, Mr. Putin’s appeal to a shared history is little but a hollow attempt to appropriate the country’s own heritage and justify territorial ambitions.
“They stole our past,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a pro-Western think tank in Kyiv. “Now they’re trying to steal our future.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">With the large Russian troop buildup on the borders of Ukraine, White House, NATO and European leaders have been working to project a united front to deter the Kremlin and convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that there would be a heavy price to pay in the event of war.
</span>On the eve of his virtual summit with Mr. Putin, President Biden spoke with allied leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain.
“The leaders discussed their shared concern about the Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and Russia’s increasingly harsh rhetoric,” according to a readout from the White House. They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions, the statement said, and agreed that diplomacy was the only way forward.
Even as the leaders issued assurances of solidarity, many European officials are worried that Mr. Putin could respond to pressure by diminishing gas supplies to Europe as winter approaches.
The crisis also comes as Germany is changing leadership and France is facing an election, creating a shifting landscape that the White House fears the Kremlin might move to exploit.
At the Pentagon on Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III convened top military and civilian officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the head of the military’s European Command, to discuss the Russian troop buildup.
Officials said that there was an effort underway to send additional defensive weapons, including anti-tank Javelins, to Ukraine, but that they may be kept in position outside the country to avoid giving Mr. Putin a pretext for military action.
Some NATO country officials have counseled against such a move, suggesting that it would not make much difference in the outcome if an invasion should come and could provoke Mr. Putin, rather than deter him.
Given the risks involved, some analysts, like Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argue that Mr. Putin is seeking diplomatic leverage and that the main aim of his troop buildup is not to conquer Ukraine but to get a satisfactory response from the United States.
“Putin is clearly frustrated about being ignored by Washington,” Mr. Trenin said. He noted that Mr. Putin’s earlier troop buildup near Ukraine secured him an early summit meeting with Mr. Biden in June. “This time it will bring Biden to a dialogue on Ukraine and other security issues in Europe.”
But Mr. Trenin said the use of force could not be ruled out.
John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, declined to say whether the United States still had a small number of military advisers in Ukraine or whether the administration had decided to send additional military assistance there.
The Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that “a major war in Ukraine would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">In an open letter to the Atlantic Council, he said that among other major concerns for European society, a war could result in “between three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion” and could seriously disrupt food imports, including of grain, “creating a whole range of food security problems for the entire continent.”
</span>“Russia’s attack would also mark a definitive end to the rules-based international order, opening the door to a new era of global insecurity that would threaten decades of unprecedented peace throughout most of Europe,” he wrote.

Vast amounts of money are being shifted around based on strange and conflicting rules
Aficionados of Tesla Inc. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">TSLA -1.93% were celebrating last week as the electric-car maker was accepted into the S&<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> propelling its shares <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 22% in</span> two days.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Step back from the extraordinary gains, and the fact that America’s seventh-biggest company by market value is only now to be admitted to the index of the country’<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 500 most</span>-valuable stocks is weird.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But it is only the most obvious of many strange but stock-price-moving ways that indexes rumble markets.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Indexes play two important but often conflicting roles: They measure broad market performance, and they are investment tools.
Start with Tesla.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It will join the S&<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 next</span> month after a decision by the committee that oversees the index.</span> The same committee had rejected the company in September even after it finally met the index’s qualification condition of being profitable <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 months</span>.
Index membership really matters, because there is <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11 trillion</span> indexed or benchmarked to the S&P. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Passive funds will have to buy tens of billions of dollars of Tesla stock—hence, the big move in price.</span> So much money will need to move when the index is reconstituted next month that S&P is consulting on adding the car maker in two chunks.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Again, for both the passive investor and those using the index as a gauge of market performance, this is strange.</span> Why do companies have to be profitable before they are allowed into the index? <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of investing passively is to leave it up to other people to decide if a company earns enough to justify its stock price.</span> A gauge of performance should measure the profitable and the loss-makers alike. Plenty of companies are loss-making after they join the index, especially this year; it is odd that once in the club, the condition no longer applies.
David Blitzer, who retired as chairman of the S&P index committee last year, says the profitability rule was introduced <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2000 as</span> dot-coms boomed, because a previous “going-concern” condition was seen as too vague.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Other than the profits rule, the fundamentals of a stock were almost completely ignored by the committee.</span> Almost. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“The only time valuations came up is if a stock had a big run up that no one could explain, because no one wanted to put a stock in [the index] and then have it <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drop 25% the</span> next week,” Mr. Blitzer said.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Tesla stock is up sixfold this year and trading at more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">forecast 2021 earnings</span>.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The profits rule is only the most glaring of many conflicts between an investor tool and a gauge of the market.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Investors want anything that helps performance and eases trading, while a measure of the market should be comprehensive.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 is</span> by design not comprehensive, including only big stocks, but if it can exclude such a huge company as Tesla, what is it for?
</span>The answer, according to S&P’s website, is that it “is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.” In the world of investment, that is pretty much all there is: If everyone uses the S&P as the benchmark, you have to pay attention. As Tesla’s move last week showed, the sheer weight of money means the S&P matters.
This has perverse effects, because other indexes, with different rules, are used elsewhere. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The result is that the same stock can sit in several benchmarks, attracting money from those tracking, say the eurozone, as well as the U.S.—and contributing to the widely used futures tied to those indexes.
Consider TechnipFMC PLC.</span> The British-registered oil-services company is the second-smallest member of the S&P by value, and so is at risk of being booted out next month to make way for Tesla. (It might also stay, as the committee isn’t forced to remove any particular company, any more than it was forced to add Tesla.)
On Wednesday, TechnipFMC—formed from the merger of French and U.S. companies—was one of the best performers in the index. It was also one of the best performers in the Euro Stoxx index, where it is classified as a French company, and in Vanguard’s popular FTSE Europe ETF, where it is also treated as French. So a diversified portfolio using benchmarks from different index providers would probably have TechnipFMC twice—neither of them in the place where it is legally based.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">When index investing got going in the 1970s, this wasn’t a problem because almost all companies were listed in the country where they were registered, based and did most of their business.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Globalization has broken the links, with companies shifting for tax reasons, more cross-border mergers and many multinationals doing most of their business outside their home countries.
</span>“Where a company is listed is pretty much irrelevant in today’s situation,” says Martyn Hole, an investment director at Capital Group, whose Capital International provided the “CI” in MSCI. (They are no longer linked.) <span id=""18"" class=""red"">He says aside from some corporate-governance rules and governmental pressure, stock pickers should focus on where companies make their money, not where they happen to be listed.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The index providers are in a bind, sometimes focusing on listing location, sometimes on legal status, and other times on where a company does its business—in part because of what investors want.
</span>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">How have you handled investments in stock indexes this year?</span> Do you plan to follow the same strategy in 2021? Join the conversation below.
MSCI includes foreign-listed companies in its home-country indexes where there are a lot of them, as with Israel, China and the Netherlands. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">There aren’t many German companies listed overseas, so German vaccine maker BioNTech SE, which IPO’d on Nasdaq, doesn’t qualify for MSCI’s German or European indexes.</span> Because it is German, it doesn’t qualify for MSCI USA either. On the other hand, Tesla has been in MSCI’s U.S. indexes <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> because there is no rule on profits.
Most of these problems can be avoided by using very broad global indexes, such as MSCI All Country World or FTSE All-World, which have several large ETFs tracking them. There are still differences in which stocks qualify, notably nonvoting shares, but such an approach does at least avoid the biggest anomalies.
Investors still need to pay attention. There are vast amounts of money being shifted around based on strange and conflicting rules.

81263,"<h3>Switzerland May Be Preparing for the End of the Euro - Breitbart</h3>Something is brewing in Europe now that has the Swiss National Bank worried.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">If you haven’t been paying attention in the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 24 hours</span>, the currency and equity markets have been rocked by a surprise move to delink the existing currency peg between the Euro and the Swiss Franc.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This move has set off what many are calling a “financial tsunami” that could leave behind a path of destruction across the continent.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Waking up to find that the local Swiss ATM will not dispense Euros may be viewed as a short-term inconvenience to the average man on the street, but learning that depositing your money in a Swiss bond with maturities of less <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 7 years</span> will cost you money, is catastrophic.</span> It is worth repeating, if you lend or deposit your money with the Swiss, they are going to charge you, not pay you.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Negative interest rates are never a sign that things are getting better–quite the opposite.</span> The current yield curve movement indicates a growing concern that things are deteriorating. The further out on the curve the negative rates go, the greater the perceived danger. From the recent moves, many would conclude that Europe is in serious trouble. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Yesterday, the Swiss stock market responded by crashing–experiencing its worse daily drop in over two decades, while its currency skyrocketed.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Central bankers gave the market no advanced warning of this decision, raising the specter of “why now?”</span> What is on the horizon to cause such a drastic move since this non-orderly response is akin to running for the exit in a crowded theater before someone yells “fire”? <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most currency moves are gradual in nature, like watching a glacier move.</span> This type of disruption has the hallmarks of panic.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Swiss have been trying for years to manage the imbalance of monetary policies across the Euro zone.</span> Linking together nations like Germany and their irresponsible cousin, Greece, has been a recipe for disaster since inception. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The very idea of balanced budgets and fiscal constraint are such foreign concepts among the various participants.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many would argue that the storm clouds have been building for some time and that the very notion of a lasting unified currency was doomed to fail from the start.</span> The question for most has always been about the timing, and the degree to which Germany, in particular, would continue to carry the other nations who couldn’t stay within the set guidelines of membership. The day of reckoning may be at hand.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Over the last few years, the Swiss balance sheet has ballooned in response to defending their currency, as concerns over the Euro instability grew stronger.</span> First Cyprus, then Greece, and now the overall weakness in many of the EU’s members have many believing that there will be a massive round of quantitative easing unleashed at some future date in response to the deflationary spiral the continent is experiencing. The flight to safety is now on and, for most Europeans, no place is viewed to be safer than Switzerland.
War-gaming this from the sidelines<span id=""11"" class=""red"">, it appears that the Swiss National Bank believes they will be unable to maintain the currency peg given the size of any upcoming stimulus.</span> Rather than stick around and tie themselves to a sinking ship, it is probably best to man the lifeboats and distance themselves as the geopolitical risks mount.
Previously, the Swiss were obligated to continuously purchase unlimited quantities of Euros to maintain <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.20 peg</span> that they decided to implement back in September <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Interestingly, this Euro/Franc peg coincided with the nominal high in gold prices, as the world feared that there were increasingly smaller places to park safe money.</span> This decision was not made haphazardly.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Based on their current balance sheet, this move could cost the Swiss government over <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100 billion</span> dollars.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">This is a move equaling more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15% of</span> its GDP for an economy the size of Pennsylvania.</span> The broken promise made to maintain the peg has been nothing but expensive talk. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The great and powerful central banks of the world have been trumpeting for years that they were omnipotent and more powerful than market forces, but as we have seen, much of their talk has been nothing but smoke and mirrors to placate the public.
</span>The Swiss now look like the architects of the Titanic trying to explain how the policy that they implemented just a few years ago is no longer holding water. After the recent defeat of the gold referendum back in November, the very concerns they gave for not implementing it have now coming home to roost. Gold has been strangely surging ever since the referendums failure. It would be naive to believe that no one outside the SNB knew this was coming.
There is an old joke, “how do you know when a central banker is lying? When his lips are moving.” The next few months will unveil the real reasons for the decision and, more than likely, they will not be for any of the official reasons given today by the Swiss National Bank.

88390,"<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell’s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”

But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.

The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.

McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.

Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 10 </span>— have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.

On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.

But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.

“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”

Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

McConnell declined to comment.

<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”

McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span>

“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”

‘It didn’t change a thing’

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 shooting</span> — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.

After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”

“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.

“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”

Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.

“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”

Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.

For McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.

Almost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell — then the Senate minority leader — downplayed the effort.

Asked about gun-control issues on ABC’s “This Week” in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2013 </span>— less than month after Sandy Hook — <span id=""1"" class=""red"">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden’s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like “spending and debt” in the coming months.

</span>Then, later that month — after Obama <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead — McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.

“President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,” McConnell said in the recording. “Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.”

McConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.

At the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.

When Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">failed 54 to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.

“McConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,” said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. “It’s why he’s been able to survive as leader for so long.”

Jesse Benton — a conservative activist who managed Paul’<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 one</span> — said that McConnell at the time “said something to me like, ‘I hope you know I’m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' ”

“He’s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,” Benton said. “He respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.”

McConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.

But that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 primary</span>.

“When the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,” said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. “He has never stood up when it was really tough.”

‘An obstacle to taking any action’

For McConnell,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.

At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.

</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).

The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.

Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.

The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.

“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”

</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.

By the night of Aug.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell’s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.

That Thursday, Aug.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville’s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was “anxious to get an outcome, and so am I.”

“What we can’t do is fail to pass something,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome.”

He added that background checks — which he said had “a lot of support” publicly — and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.

But a special session was never called.

The week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: “I said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I’d be happy to put it on the floor.”

By the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump’s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine — drawing Trump’s attention away from guns.

This past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell — now the Senate minority leader again — took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation “sickened and outraged by the senseless evil” that left at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 students</span> and two teachers “murdered for no apparent reason at all.”

He did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the “innocent young lives” that were prematurely extinguished.

“Words simply fail,” McConnell said.

On Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.

“Maybe this will provide some impetus” for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. “This is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.”

But most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.

“There are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: “We must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there’s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.”

After a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen “only in America.” Cruz accused the reporter of having a “political agenda.”

Cruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to “harden schools” — such as having only one usable door.

On Friday, Trump — still the de facto leader of the Republican Party — joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.

Support for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict — an increase <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 43 percent</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.

In contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).

But many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett — a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank — said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.

“The ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something — and who knows how many there truly are — don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to get crosswise with the base,” Bennett said.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell’s declaration on the Senate floor that “words simply fail.”

He said he agrees completely.

“I don’t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,” Feinblatt said. “I am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.”

“But,” he added, “There is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.”

May’s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

</span>“Given everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we’ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,” she said. “Inflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors’ fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.

</span>Airline fares <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“We suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9% as</span> early as next month,” said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.

</span>“For people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Other than substituting out cheaper food types—cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be—people need to continue buying food.”

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Employers <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans’ bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman’s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.

“I canceled my October tour. I just don’t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,” she said.

<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy’s ability to meet demand without price rises.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">“To get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,” he said.

58696,"<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?”
“We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
“The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
“It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.”
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
</span>In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.”
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
“I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.”
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.”</span> She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.”
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.”
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
“You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That’s how capitalism should work.”
“The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.”
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
“There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 30 percentage</span> points.
“Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.”
Former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who is challenging Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, were also on the schedule."
21067,"<h3>Looking to themselves, Palestinians expect little from Israeli changes.</h3>Wide-Ranging Israel Coalition Reaches Deal to Form Government
Negotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.
JERUSALEM — Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation’s politics to the right.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.
The new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.
While some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction.
The alliance would be led <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.
If the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2023 and</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.
The son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.
Though Mr. Bennett’s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Lapid,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.
Yair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute — leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.
“The government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.
Mr. Lapid’s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.
In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu’s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid’s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition. Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office.
Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a sign of the friction to come, Raam, the Arab Islamist party, announced that it had joined the coalition after receiving assurances about improvements to the Arab minority’s land and housing rights that many hard-right Israelis deem unacceptable, including the regularization of three illegally constructed Arab towns in the Negev desert.
</span>An hour before the deal was announced, one hard-right lawmaker, Nir Orbach, whose party colleagues say he has been particularly unsure about joining the coalition, tweeted: “We are not abandoning the Negev. Period.”
The fact that these tensions were on full display even before the coalition was officially formed has left many Israelis wondering whether it will last more than a few months, let alone its full term.
Should the coalition collapse, analysts believe Mr. Lapid may emerge with more credit than Mr. Bennett. While Mr. Bennett gets first crack at the premiership, his decision to work with centrists and leftists has angered his already small following.
“Lapid has made a very strong set of decisions, conveyed an amazing level of maturity and really made a big statement about a different kind of leadership,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster at the Century Foundation, a New York-based research group. “That will not be lost on the Israeli public.”

Now that opposition parties have reached agreement on a coalition government, it has up to seven days to present the government to Parliament for a vote of confidence.
Some disagreements within the fractious coalition were still being ironed out until shortly before the deadline on Wednesday, at midnight in Israel.
And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.
The coalition, ranging from right to left, is united primarily by its opposition to Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009.</span>
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel has held four parliamentary elections in two years, all of them inconclusive, leaving it without a stable government or state budget.</span> If the opposition fails to form a government, it could lead to yet another election.
Naftali Bennett, who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, is a former high-tech entrepreneur best known for insisting that there must never be a full-fledged Palestinian state and that Israel should annex much of the occupied West Bank.
The independently wealthy son of immigrants from the United States, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> first entered the Israeli Parliament eight years ago and is relatively unknown and inexperienced on the international stage. That has left much of the world — and many Israelis — wondering what kind of leader he might be.
A former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Bennett is often described as more right-wing than his old boss. Shifting between seemingly contradictory alliances, Mr. Bennett has been called an extremist and an opportunist. Allies say he is merely a pragmatist, less ideological than he appears, and lacking Mr. Netanyahu’s penchant for demonizing opponents.
In a measure of Mr. Bennett’s talents, he has now pulled off a feat that is extraordinary even by the perplexing standards of Israeli politics. He has all but maneuvered himself into the top office even though his party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in the Parliament.
Mr. Bennett leveraged his modest but pivotal electoral weight after the inconclusive March election, Israel’s fourth in two years. He entered coalition talks as a kingmaker, and appears ready to emerge as the one wearing the crown.
Mr. Bennett has long championed West Bank settlers and once led the council representing them, though he is not a settler, himself. He is religiously observant — he would be the first prime minister to wear a kipa — but he will head a governing coalition that is largely secular.
He would lead a precarious coalition that spans Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and includes a small Arab, Islamist party — much of which opposes his ideas on settlement and annexation. That coalition proposes to paper over its differences on Israeli-Palestinian relations by focusing on domestic matters.
Mr. Bennett has explained his motives for teaming up with such ideological opposites as an act of last resort to end the political impasse that has paralyzed Israel.
“The political crisis in Israel is unprecedented on a global level,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday. “We could end up with fifth, sixth, even 10th elections, dismantling the walls of the country, brick by brick, until our house falls in on us. Or we can stop the madness and take responsibility.”
One of the most unlikely kingmakers involved in the formation of a new government is Mansour Abbas, the leader of the small Arab party known by its Hebrew acronym, Raam, with four seats in the current Parliament.
Under an 11th-hour deal, Raam formally agreed to join a Lapid-Bennett coalition government, though it would not hold any Cabinet seats. That was something of a surprise, as the party was expected to remain outside the coalition, while supporting it in a confidence vote in the Parliament. Some Arab lawmakers played a similar role by supporting Yitzhak Rabin’s government from the outside in the 1990s.
For decades, Arab parties have not been directly involved in Israeli governments. They have been mostly shunned by other parties, and are leery of joining a government that oversees occupation of the Palestinian territories and Israel’s military actions.
But after decades of political marginalization, many Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of Israel’s population, have been seeking fuller integration.
Israel’s early, leftist governments included Arab parties that were closely affiliated with the mostly Jewish parties. Raam would be the first independent Arab party in government, and the first Arab party of any kind in a right-leaning government.
Raam has been willing to work with both the pro- and anti-Netanyahu camps since the March election and to use its leverage to wrest concessions for the Arab public. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The party has refused to commit to a deal unless it gets assurances for greater resources and rights for Israel’s Arab minority, including reforms to housing legislation that potential hard-right coalition partners do not accept.

Sitting in her office in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Idit Silman, a hard-right lawmaker, flicked through hundreds of recent text messages from unknown numbers.
Some were laced with abusive language. Some warned she was going to hell. All of them demanded that her party abandon coalition negotiations with an alliance of centrist, leftist and right-wing lawmakers seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 12 years</span>.
“It’s very hard,” Ms. Silman said. “People would rather put pressure on Idit Silman than see Benjamin Netanyahu leave Balfour Street,” she added, in a reference to the location of the prime minister’s official residence.
As opposition negotiators race to meet a midnight deadline to agree on a new government, supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party were working overtime to pressure Ms. Silman and other members of the right-wing Yamina party.
Many right-wing Israelis see Yamina’s turn against Mr. Netanyahu as a betrayal.
This onslaught gave Ms. Silman and her colleagues pause for thought — and an incentive to be seen as prolonging the negotiations for as long as possible. Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.
Parliament might not hold a vote of confidence in a new government for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 days</span>, giving Mr. Netanyahu more time to persuade Yamina lawmakers to reverse course.
His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues.
“Behind the scenes,” said a senior Likud official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “the Likud party is ramping up the pressure, particularly on the weakest links.”
The pressure has been relentless for days, since the phone numbers of Ms. Silman and her colleagues, they say, were posted on several WhatsApp and Facebook groups. That has prompted a barrage of messages — and not just from Israelis. Evangelical pastors in the United States have weighed in, and so have Hasidic activists in Britain, among many others.
The Likud party denies accusations that it posted any numbers publicly.
When Ms. Silman turned up at her local synagogue last week, she found several slick posters outside, each with her portrait overlaid with the slogan: “Idit Silman stitched together a government with terror supporters.”
For days, protesters have picketed her home, shouted abuse at her children, and trailed her by car in a menacing fashion, she said.
Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, decided to negotiate with the opposition on Sunday night, after months of wavering. His calculus was based on realism, analysts say: Mr. Netanyahu cannot form a coalition, even with Mr. Bennett’s support. So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister — or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.
“We always ask ourselves this question,” Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. “Is it right? Can we do something else?”
Patrick Kingsley and
Naftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.
Spanning Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the “change government” by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.
The opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their “change government” bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel’s longest-serving leader?
Mr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.
Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.
If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 17 seats</span>.
By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.
In a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.
The coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.
“Two thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,” he said. “This will not happen again. Not on my watch.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.

The president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel’s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.
One of a president’s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel’s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.
The president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.

Less than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.
At <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza’s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.
The war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.
Here is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.
JERUSALEM — For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.
But for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.
During Mr. Netanyahu’s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.
But to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.
Instead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.
The Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.
But spurred by last month’s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.
In a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I don’t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,” said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> “There might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.”
The strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, “showed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.”
“None of that has worked,” he said. “We are back to square one.”"
28063,"<h3>Discovery’s departure is ‘shot across the bow’ for Silver Spring, state and region</h3>Across the street from Discovery Communications’ towering headquarters in downtown Silver Spring, Jay Ayaba eyed the line of customers at the Starbucks where he works as a shift supervisor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It was almost time for an early afternoon surge, overwhelmingly made up of Discovery employees whom Ayaba has come to know by name, face and order — such as Susie and her extra-hot decaf latte.
</span>“This might be a Discovery rush right here,” Ayaba said, looking over his shoulder.
Ayaba,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> remembers how much Discovery’s arrival enlivened Silver Spring. He says it was as if “a whole new community had been built overnight.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now he’s worried about the impact of the company’s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.
</span>“We’re still going to be open,” Ayaba said, “but it’s going to be slower than usual around here.”
Plenty of others share his concerns. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Discovery’s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company — perhaps best-known for airing “Shark Week” — that sparked the suburb’s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery’s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area’s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move — largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York — cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.
[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Montgomery’s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area’s high prices.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> lower.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It’s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn’t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,” said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,” Fuller said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company’s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery’s acquisition, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.
</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations — New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville — and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Our decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,” chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> “We’ve had a wonderful run [here].”
[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery’s move to New York.]
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.
“They assured us it didn’t have anything to do with Maryland,” Hogan said. “They’re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs — some of which will also go to Los Angeles — and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.
</span>“This is a shot across the bow for this region,” said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=""13"" class=""red"">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> “We need to seriously address some of these challenges.”
Discovery’s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.
</span>“We don’t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,” Fuller said. “Businesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.”
From its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.
</span>The company built <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.
Discovery’s arrival “put Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,” said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.
<span id=""16"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.
</span>The company’s departure is “devastating for Silver Spring,” Duncan said. “It is going to be really hard to replace them.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery’s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was “petrifying.”
Moving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can’t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been “Bethesda’s redheaded stepsister.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would “just have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It’s all we can do.”
A few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina’s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He’d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.
</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was “really big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring” but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Now that there’s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it’s very scary as a business operator,” Parkhurst said.
</span>Discovery’s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country’s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.
</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region’s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.
“We have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,” Buchanan said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Business leaders said Discovery’s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.
</span>“Regions need to focus on their strengths,” said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. “What’s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Economic growth has been weak <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The jobs it has added — many of them in the service industry — are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Among the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.
</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“There’s no question it’s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,” said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“They don’t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50 percent</span> range,” compared with those in Montgomery, he said.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">According to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Tennessee’s corporate income tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.
</span>Discovery’s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company’s headquarters was in Maryland.
“When the new guy came in, there didn’t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,” Duncan, the former county executive, said.
That was in contrast with Discovery’s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 with</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel. It hit the airwaves with an after-school special on icebergs.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">In time, the network was a giant of reality TV, the home of shows such as “19 Kids and Counting,” “The Crocodile Hunter” and “Dirty Jobs.”
</span>Hendricks lured Zaslav, who <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">turns 58 on</span> Monday, from a top post at NBC Universal <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 to</span> become its chief executive.
“Working with John gave me the fever,” Zaslav said in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2006 interview</span> with The Washington Post, calling Hendricks “a mentor.”
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Zaslav overhauled the company, closing its retail stores, ousting veteran executives and reducing the workforce <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span>.</span> He rebranded some of the channel’s properties, making it leaner and more profitable.
“David is a hard-driving guy, direct but likable,” said Hugh Panero, founder and former chief executive at XM Satellite Radio and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs. “He came to Discovery when it was down, and he turned it around. He is very focused, smart. He identifies what needs to be fixed . . . sees the pins and knocks them down, pursuing his objectives relentlessly.”
Malone, who sits on the Discovery board, is reportedly a fan.
“Malone does not suffer fools,” said Panero, who has known Zaslav since they worked together in New York media <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">circles 30 years</span> ago. “For Malone, it’s all about what you deliver. He thinks very highly of him.”
Zaslav was well rewarded. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">He is one of the most highly compensated people in the country, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $341 million</span> in cash, stock and other benefits over company fiscal <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">years 2012 through</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> according to Equilar, an executive data firm.</span> Total shareholder return during that period <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 34 percent</span>, according to Equilar.
The news hasn’t all been bad for Montgomery and Maryland. Last year, state and county officials succeeded in keeping Marriott International in Montgomery. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">They <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $62 million</span> in loans, tax credits and grants to build a new headquarters in Bethesda, where the hospitality giant has been based <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 40 years</span>.
</span>Once Discovery leaves, however, Maryland will be the home of only two <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> other than Marriott: Lockheed Martin and Host Hotels & Resorts.
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">The loss of Discovery “is a real setback, both symbolically and in terms of local employment,” said Anirban Basu, an economist at Baltimore-based Sage Policy Group.</span> “Maryland is not home to many <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span>, and to lose this headquarters represents an unsightly blemish for the state.”

70781,"<h3>Global Competition to Cut Corporate Taxes Heats Up</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Both Theresa May and Donald Trump are backing tax cuts to keep companies at home and attracting new ones

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET

An international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.

</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain’s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% by</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> from today’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 20%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate—down from the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 35%.</span>

</span>Mr. Trump’s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor’s further recommendation—made after the Brexit vote—to go down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.

</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense. The country, in particular London, has been a magnet for global firms looking to set up European beachheads or global offices. It benefits from a convenient time zone between Asia and the Americas, strong legal protections and a large pool of well-educated, English-speaking workers.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">But after Britain’s <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 vote</span> to leave the European Union, many companies based there have scrambled to assess whether they will continue to benefit from two other, big advantages that come with EU membership: unfettered access to Europe’s common market and the free movement of labor across the bloc.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Britain’s Institute of Directors, a group of company directors and senior business leaders, found in a poll shortly after the vote that more than a fifth of respondents said they were considering moving some of their operations outside the U.K. because of the vote.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mrs. May has tried to assure British and foreign companies that the U.K. will continue to be a competitive place to do business.</span> Her charm offensive has included closed-door meetings with corporate heads such as Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest car maker in the U.K. Mr. Ghosn had considered passing over Sunderland and picking a factory in continental Europe to build a new model, but he backtracked after meeting with Mrs. May.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mrs. May’s announcement, made in a speech to U.K. business leaders, reassured companies that she was still prepared to carry through on the tax reductions approved by Parliament during her predecessor’s government.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She didn’t mention a specific tax-cutting target.

</span>That left unclear whether she would be willing to embrace a further cut <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%,</span> which was proposed—but never acted upon—by then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. An aide to Mrs. May said only she was committed to the plans already in place to cut the rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17%.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, business leaders took it as a strong signal of support for keeping corporate tax low.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s good to see the government reaffirm its commitment to lower corporation tax,” said a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The plan to gradually move to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 17% corporate</span>-tax rate would give Britain the lowest headline corporate-tax rate among the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20,</span> a collection of the world’s richest nations.</span> At the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 20%,</span> its headline rate is already one of the lowest in the G-20, equal to that of Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17%,</span> it would still be above Ireland’<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12.5%,</span> but well below most other large economies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It might also be at the limit of what Britain’s finances can stand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Britain has a large deficit and is very constrained on how much tax-cutting it can do,” said Charles Beer, managing director of independent tax advisory Taxand in Britain.</span> He said the government could speed up implementing <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 17% rate</span>, “but it’s hard to see how they can do a major move down.”

Vodafone Group PLC said in the days immediately after the June vote that it might have to reconsider its U.K. headquarters. It has since backtracked, saying it is happy to be British based. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A spokesman declined to comment on Mrs. May’s tax pledge.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The race to lower corporate taxes comes amid a broader tax shake-up that has played out over recent years.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 100 countries</span>, including the U.S. and most of Europe, have agreed to close—or at least narrow—legal loopholes that big companies use to shift profits to places where they pay little or no income tax.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">EU regulators have also taken aim at tailor-made tax deals between certain member countries and companies.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Once those loopholes are closed the main way countries can compete is by lowering their base corporate tax rate,” said Paolo Giacometti, a partner at Italian law firm Chiomenti.</span> “So we will see this trend continue.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">It is often hard to compare corporate-tax rates in an apples-to-apples fashion.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some countries have wider corporate-tax bases, for instance, or charge different rates for different-sized companies.</span> Companies also have to contend with an array of regional taxes, such as U.S. state taxes. Still, the national rate is often the easiest-to-convey message of welcome—or warning—a government can send to corporate executives.

Germany and Ireland made big cuts at the beginning of this century in a bid to attract corporate investment. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Berlin clawed back much of what it lost in revenue by making it harder for companies to take deductions.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ireland’s sharp headline corporate-tax cuts early in the decade helped it become one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for many companies looking for European or global headquarters.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But it is also now pulling back on other corporate-tax benefits.</span> Two years ago, for instance, Dublin said it would end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 a</span> gambit it called the “Double Irish.” <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The structure allowed multinationals to lower their taxable profit in one Irish subsidiary by paying royalties into another Irish-registered subsidiary that was managed in a tax haven—making it exempt from Irish income tax.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Italy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015 moved</span> to lower its national corporate tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.5 percentage</span> points, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24%.</span></span> That reduction takes effect next year. Even France, long a holdout, has embraced the trend in the past few years, though rates in the country are still higher than in most of Europe.

23219,"<h3>Assange's Arrest Was Possible Because Ecuador Abandoned Socialism</h3>The shocking news Thursday morning that the government of Ecuador invited British police into its embassy in London to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange left many questioning why the Latin American country, which protected Assange for over half a decade, now felt comfortable letting him go.
The move by President Lenin Moreno – a socialist in name only who has used his tenure in office to liberalize the country after a decade of socialist rule – is the latest salvo in his ongoing campaign to erase the legacy of predecessor Rafael Correa.
Moreno is a member of Correa’s socialist party and became president after the latter threatened to dismantle the entire government if Ecuadorians did not elect his hand-picked successor. Yet he has all but eviscerated the relationship Correa cultivated with Marxist dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, demanded a revision of the country’s ties to communist China, and led a probe into Correa’s tenure that culminated in an arrest warrant for the former head of state.
This week, Moreno cut yet another Correa-era alliance, this time with a controversial antagonist whose only use to Correa was to annoy the U.S. government and help him cover up for authoritarian acts against Ecuadorian journalists.
“Ecuador is a generous country and a nation with open arms. Ours is a government respectful of the principles of international law, and of the institution of the right of asylum,” Moreno stated in a video message distributed on social media explaining the reasoning behind allowing Assange’s arrest. “Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law.”
Moreno called Assange “disrespectful and aggressive” and accused him of “threatening declarations against Ecuador.” Beyond Assange’s personal behavior, however, Moreno argued that keeping him protected at the embassy violated international law.
“Ecuador’s patience with the behavior of Mr. Assange has reached its limit,” he concluded.
Ecuador decidió soberanamente retirar el asilo diplomático a Julian Assange por violar reiteradamente convenciones internacionales y protocolo de convivencia. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/V02pvvtPY0

Correa</span></span> was among the first on Twitter to condemn Moreno, writing from exile in Belgium.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“Lenin Moreno, the nefarious president of Ecuador, has demonstrated his poverty of humanity to the world, handing over Julian Assange – not just a refugee, but also an Ecuadorian citizen – to British police,” Correa wrote.</span> “This risks Assange’s life and humiliates Ecuador. Day of national mourning.”
Correa does not mention that Moreno’s government, not his, extended the courtesy of citizenship to Assange.
Lenín Moreno, nefasto presidente del Ecuador, ha demostrado su miseria humana al mundo, entregando a Julián Assange -no solo asilado, sino también ciudadano ecuatoriano- a la policía británica.
Esto pone en riesgo la vida de Assange, y humilla al Ecuador.
Día de luto mundial.

Correa</span></span> went on to call Moreno “the biggest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history” in a barrage of Twitter posts. At press time, Correa has insulted Moreno on <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Twitter 12 times</span>, not counting retweets of others’ insults.
Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Assange was particularly offended by Ecuador’s demand he pay his internet bill if he wished to use the service, though reports also listed among Ecuador’s requests matters less clearly related to “fundamental rights and freedoms” such as Assange’s refusal to clean up after his cat.</span> The Ecuadorian courts dismissed the suit.
The Ecuadorian government’s issues with Assange aside, his status as a Correa-era bargaining chip proved of little value to Moreno. When Assange took refuge in the embassy <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> socialism was ascendant in South America and then-Ecuadorian President Correa had allied himself with the region’s worst leftist dictators: Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Correa had just begun emulating the Chávez tactic of shutting down opposition media networks when Assange’s legal situation made state protection – from any state – a must. Correa took the opportunity to lend Assange a hand, claiming to protect the right to a free press and a win against perennial Latin American leftist bogeyman “imperialism” in the process.
“They don’t realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won’t tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind,” Correa said of the British at the time.
That language, which often featured anti-American tropes, defined the Correa era, as it did that of many leaders in the region at the time: Chávez, Castro regime henchmen, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, Peru’s Ollanta Humala, Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, among others. When right-wing challengers arose to replace many of these leaders later in the decade, many assumed Correa’s socialist movement to be among the few survivors of the continent’s rejection of socialism because of Lenin’s victory. Correa had supported Lenin vocally, at one point telling voters that, should they vote for his conservative rival, Correa would use an obscure procedural rule to dismantle the government and force another election over and over until voters got it “right.”
It took little time for Moreno to use his presidential powers to shift Ecuador rightward. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Under Moreno, Ecuador reversed policies to silence critics in the media and liberalized the economy.</span> It stopped pouring funds into Telesur, a far-left propaganda network largely controlled by Venezuela and Cuba. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It has begun reevaluating oil deals with China that may have cost the Latin American country millions, presumably in exchange for political support on the global stage.</span> Those deals resulted in Ecuadorian courts first subpoenaing Correa to testify, then ordering his arrest. Moreno’s government has also enacted presidential term limits to block Correa for running for office again.
Most spectacularly, Moreno cut ties to Correa’s closest foreign ally, Venezuela. In an acrimonious declaration in August, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry cut ties with the Maduro regime, resulting in an exchange of words with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister in which the latter referred to Moreno as a “liar” and a puppet of the United Nations. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ecuador’s government issued a formal response calling the minister an “embarrassment” and a “poor excuse for a human being,” and his government “sinister.”
Tensions between Moreno and Latin America’s leftists, who once considered him one of their own, will likely continue to worsen as the Venezuelan political crisis continues, bringing the economies of its allies like Cuba down with it.</span> With Assange’s arrest, Moreno has signaled to those powers that he has no intention of returning to their circle.

How a Dog’s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another
After a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.
Supported by
Real-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.
In a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what’s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?
Here’s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.
On Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before — tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing — and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.
According to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.
The man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog’s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.
Both women <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. “Moose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,” Ms. Chrustic said. “My focus was just on caring for him.”
Ms. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?
Moose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.
But then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.
Weeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic’s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.
She was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. “You have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,” she said. “He’s known by the community. It’s disheartening.”
It was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.
“It’s complicated,” said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. “It’s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.
“There are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,” he added. “We can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.”
The Nextdoor effect
Nextdoor, which claims an average <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, “When neighbors start talking, good things happen.”
One thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of “suspicious” characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, “@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.”
A Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.
When Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked — why weren’t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.
But gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a “monster,” a “predator” or a “psychopath.” As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.
Martin Lofsnes,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called “this vigilante attitude.”
He urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider “400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.” Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.
With all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.
Others called Mr. Lofsnes naïve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.
“It’s easy to say that you’re for prison reform and you’re a liberal, until it happens to you,” Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. “When it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, ‘What does this do in the larger scheme of things?’”
To Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.
Though most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. “People can be horrible,” she said. “And people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.”
</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.
For Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic’s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.
“When I read Jessica’s post, I got really, really triggered,” she said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it’s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.” The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: “I tell those people to shut up. They don’t have a leg to stand on.
“I don’t care that it’s being divisive, and that people don’t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,” Ms. Haddad added. “I’m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He’s targeting women and dogs. He’s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Don’t be a cop, Kris
Kristian Nammack,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to “take our neighborhood back.” As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. “We may also get to wear cool berets,” his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime “safety patrol” prominent in the ’70s and ’80s.
Mr. Nammack’s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.
He did not see the backlash coming.
“In my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 6 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span>” he said. “Not vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.”
Mr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Then there was the group’s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group’s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.
As described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, “We are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,” according to Hell Gate. “The opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.”
To the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, “Crime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,” according to Common Sense.
A few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack’s apartment: “Don’t Be a Cop, Kris.” It rattled him. “Even being gay, I don’t know that I’ve ever been the target of hate,” he said. “I felt that I was the target of hate.” He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.
On Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.
A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland — the woman who witnessed the assault — went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.
Both Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man — whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill — than with the threat he might pose to others.
Mr. Nammack said he was told: “‘We don’t want the police involved in this.’” He said, “They didn’t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let’s not do anything.”
Under New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. “We don’t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,” Mx. Whitesides said. “When it comes to this individual, they’re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.”
The debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. “Even among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,” they said. “These debates in the community, while they can feel very tense — this is how we find a solution. It’s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.”
Can you support social justice and the police?
On a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.
Ms. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she’d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. “And I don’t even wear bracelets usually,” she said.
She said she still had not moved Moose’s bed or food bowls in her apartment.
“I’m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,” she said. “I think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He’s violent. End of story.”
For two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker’s welfare than her safety.
“Are they waiting for somebody to die?” she said. “Are they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it’s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?”
Mr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. “The Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,” he said. “It brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They’re all good questions, but I don’t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I’m walking away from it.”
For now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams “take appropriate action to rectify this matter.” More <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.
But Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic’s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.
Twenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack’s posts were removed again.

I believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me — and it should change the rest of the media too.
Perspective by Margaret Sullivan
<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT
Despite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party’s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia — “Hillary sucks but not like Monica” — but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.”
Over the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump’s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn’t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it — and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a “lifetime member of the NRA,” asserted that people like me wouldn’t be around much longer. Another, signed “A Real, True Patriot,” read:
“Though I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about ‘reaching the masses’ with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. ‘If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth’ — Lenin … Here’s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.”
I was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a “venomous serpent.” John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled “Memories of a Venomous Serpent.”
Now, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We’ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming “presidential.” And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.
It’s been an education for all of us — a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren’t good enough for this moment in our country’s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.
Back <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics — and I was registered to vote as a “blank.” Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.
At the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">She had her mind made up about the news media: “Journalists aren’t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton’s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: “If it’s a Republican, it’s investigated to death.</span> If it’s a Democrat, it’s breezed over.”
This assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media’s endless emphasis on Clinton’s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn’t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.
Clearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon — and believed in — was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth — and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn’t work anymore.

From this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn’t want to use the word “lie” for Trump’s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn’t be inside politicians’ heads, how were we supposed to know if — by this definition — they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.
Too many reporters and their editors didn’t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan’s Trump Tower in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn’t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as “the ratings machine,” and for once he wasn’t exaggerating.
As I continued to tackle <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press’s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump’s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it’s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes — while seeking to undermine democracy itself.

In the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post’s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.
Tossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, “an epic fail.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They — and I would include myself in this criticism — employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn’t happen, therefore it won’t happen.
</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 a</span>.m.
Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.
As we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?
For one thing, I’m convinced that journalists — specifically those who cover politics — must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.
Those who deny the outcome of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don’t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts — for example, about abortion rights or gun control — journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.
That’s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station’s website about a state legislator’s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn’t easy, one editor told me, “because this is not the normal thing.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Unfortunately, many media organizations — increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds — seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president’s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht’s unusual outreach an “apology tour.” Given all this, it’s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that’s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.
Media people — not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms — also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on “horse race” articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.
By no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are “on the team” of Trump’s rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That’s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn’t care about democratic norms — even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power — requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.
In making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn’t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren’t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, “We reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.” Quinn was blunt: “Think about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you’d see in a fascist regime.”
Of course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn’t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.
Perhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn’t just repeat what’s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.
All of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They’ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn’t remotely appropriate. By now, that’s something we all should have learned.

49862,"<h3>Analysis | AT&T’s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a less valuable, more heavily indebted company than it was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 when</span> it announced plans to acquire Time Warner and create a media-communications colossus that would dazzle consumers and shower investors with riches.
Now AT&T’s leadership is back with a new plan: unwinding the deal it once touted as “the model that wins over time.” The company said last week it would spin off its WarnerMedia unit in a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">complex $43 billion</span> deal that unites it with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly-traded entity.
John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, called the company’s latest transformative transaction “an opportunity to unlock value” — leaving unanswered the question of who had locked up the value in the first place.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While AT&T insists its Time Warner acquisition has paid off financially, many analysts said the telecommunications giant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">squandered $100 billion</span> on a dalliance with the media and entertainment worlds that could have been better spent elsewhere.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Telecom companies have no business whatsoever buying assets that are outside their core expertise,” said Allyn Arden, director at S&P Global Corporate Ratings.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“This was a business they had no business being in.”
AT&T’s pursuit of a comprehensive telecom-media-entertainment strategy certainly left investors unimpressed.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The phone company’s share price barely advanced during a period when stocks more than doubled in value.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">From the announcement of Time Warner’s acquisition to word of its spinoff, shares of AT&T gained <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 12.6 percent</span> compared to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 112.7 percent</span> increase in the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company’s market capitalization — the value of all its outstanding stock — has fallen by <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> since the end <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After bingeing on debt — and eliminating <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 jobs</span> — AT&T confronts a future as the nation’s third-largest provider of wireless services and the No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 broadband</span> company.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">AT&T’s latest reinvention also is bad news for many retail shareholders.</span> The company has long paid a generous dividend, attracting legions of mom-and-pop investors seeking dependable retirement payouts.
But shedding WarnerMedia will shrink annual dividends by nearly half, from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15 billion</span> to between <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $8 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $8.6 billion</span>, the company said.
AT&T shareholders will <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own 71 percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But many current AT&T investors didn’t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media growth stock.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They want reliable income.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“A lot of holders of AT&T stock are interested in a dividend.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One sign of how widely felt AT&T’s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company’s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world’s largest single fund, is the company’s top shareholder.
</span>By AT&T’s calculations, it’s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery’s reality television programming and WarnerMedia’s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Based on Discovery’s stock price on <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">AT&T will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia’s agreement to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it’s received from the business <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span>“We’re comfortably above <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,” said Fletcher Cook, AT&T’s vice president for corporate communications.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet Discovery’s stock has sagged <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced — and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year — calling into question whether AT&T’s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">AT&T’s math also doesn’t include the opportunity cost of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.
“If they didn’t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,” Arden said.
For AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.
The corporate saga began <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.
More than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.
<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.
“AT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It’s been instrumental to their growth,” said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. “Eventually, that strategy ran out of gas.”
Many analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.
“AT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,” said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.
AT&T’s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon’s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.
AT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.
“They decided their core competency was connectivity not content,” said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.
As investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.
Yet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company’s debt load, which has grown <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $169 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company’s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.
</span>“AT&T bit off more than they could chew,” said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. “But it remains a powerful, strong company.”"
64541,"<h3>Hackers Swipe More Than $40 Million of Bitcoin From Cryptocurrency Exchange</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:27 am ET

Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $40 million</span> worth of bitcoin from its platform in what it called a “large scale security breach.”

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.

</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2% of</span> the company’s total bitcoin holdings.

Hackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said. Binance said they had obtained information about multiple users, including two-factor authentication codes. Industry participants said they believed it was the first major breach at Binance.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Binance, which was founded in China but now operates outside the country, said it was suspending deposits and withdrawals for one week while it conducts a security review, although users will still be able to trade existing funds.</span> Stolen funds would be refunded through its emergency insurance account, the company said.

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,” Binance said. “The transaction is structured in a way that [it] passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

In a video posted on Twitter following the disclosed hack, Changpeng Zhao, chief executive at Binance, described the incident as “a very advanced, persistent hacking effort.” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said trading might need to be halted “for a couple of hours here and there” due to system upgrades.

</span>He said Binance has the funds to back the stolen amount. “It does hurt very much but we are able to cover that,” he said in the video. “We are not short on funds right now,” he added.

Hacks were a primary reason for bitcoin’s steep fall last year following its manic rally <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50% so</span> far this year, it remains down by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% from</span> its record high in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2017.</span>

</span>“People are quite used to exchange hacks,” said John Patrick Mullin, a cryptocurrency investor and blockchain consultant in Hong Kong. “Markets didn’t move nearly as much as they would’ve one year ago if the same thing happened.”

Bitcoin recently traded <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,800,</span> according to CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors are often targeted by hackers. More <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.7 billion</span> has been publicly reported stolen over the years, mostly from exchanges in Asia, including Japanese platforms Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York attorney general’s office said an exchange called Bitfinex had covered up a loss <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $850 million</span> of corporate and customer funds by using the reserves of the digital currency it controls, tether.

</span>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on independent networks and operate on the blockchain, a public record of transactions. In an effort to replicate the anonymity of physical cash, those transactions aren’t connected to an identity. The anonymity is appealing to bitcoin proponents but is also attractive to hackers and makes it tough to catch thieves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Hacking risks are part of the business reality for crypto exchanges,” said Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC. “While crypto exchanges are becoming increasingly better prepared, hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated as well.”

30538,"<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST — Hungary’s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.
But that was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Today, Origo is one of the prime minister’s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.
And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban’s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.
“Let’s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!” a headline blared earlier this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz. “Serious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.”
If little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally — and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.
In many ways, Hungary has foreshadowed the democratic backsliding now evident in different corners of the world. Since winning power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> Mr. Orban has steadily eroded institutional checks and balances, especially the independent media. His government now oversees state-owned news outlets, while his allies control most of the country’s private media sources, creating a virtual echo chamber for Mr. Orban’s far right, anti-immigrant views.
The story of Origo’s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.
Origo’s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings — including a pivotal one in Vienna — the website’s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister.
</span>“When Orban came to power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> his aim was to eliminate the media’s role as a check on government,” said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. “Orban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner — and a free press doesn’t fit into that picture.”
On the surface, Hungary’s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.
“We would never sink so low,” Mr. Orban said in a September speech, “as to silence those with whom we disagree.”
But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban’s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban’s party.
Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.
According to Freedom House’s press freedom index, Hungary’s media was judged the 87th freest in the world <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> down from joint 40th <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> when Mr. Orban entered office.
The index now labels Hungarian media as only “partly free,” while Hungary’s wider political system, once classified as a “consolidated democracy,” has been downgraded to “semi-consolidated democracy.”
And the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is “very symbolic” of that transition.
A Secret Meeting
<span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> Origo was Hungary’s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.
</span>By then, Mr. Orban’s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary’s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.
The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country’s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.
But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.
Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary’s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant which also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.
But things changed with Mr. Orban’s election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He levied an “emergency” tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">For Magyar Telekom, it meant an <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $100 million</span> tax bill.</span> Company executives feared more bad news <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> when Mr. Orban’s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.
</span>The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s C.E.O., became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.
Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban’s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.
But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo’s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government’s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo’s editors and the highest levels of government.
Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.
By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban’s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.
Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi’s firm could call Origo’s editor with suggestions about coverage.
That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country’s three mobile telephone operators.
Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.
Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: “Dialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.”
Mr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.
An Editor Fired
Outraged, Origo’s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.
By <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling’s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar’s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi’s firm to slow the project down were ignored.
But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.
The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company’s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.
Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo’s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.
Undeterred, Mr. Saling’s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar’s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister’s movements.
But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling’s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.
The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo’s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom’s management and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, according to three people at the company.
In protest, several of Origo’s best reporters resigned.
For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.
Flush With Government Cash
<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.
The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.
New Wave’s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban’s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban’s former ministers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey’s longtime business partner, company records show.
</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.
Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.
There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.
“We did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,” Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.
Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey’s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.
Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government’s stance — in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister became New Wave’s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo’s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.
</span>At the time, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban’s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.

20028,"<h3>Struggling Malls Suffer When Sears, Penney Leave</h3>Loss of Anchor Tenants Can Accelerate Downward Spiral

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 12</span>:59 pm ET

NORFOLK, Va.—With J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.

Nearly half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.

</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.

</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.

""When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,"" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.

The first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of ""dead malls,"" those with vacancy rates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 properties</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.6% last</span> year—their slowest pace <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.

""Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,"" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.

Still, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.

Penney, which racked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.

To be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> ""If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,"" Mr. Balter said.

The exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.

At the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. ""For Lease"" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.

The mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.

</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors—Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave. Cinemark didn't return calls seeking comment.

At the Southlake Mall in Morrow, Ga., after the Penney there closed in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011,</span> a number of national-chain tenants had their rent payments reduced, real-estate executives said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The mall's total sales fell <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $58 million</span> in January <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $60 million</span> in the year Penney closed as vacancies rose.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Several retailers at the mall said their sales have fallen <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 30% since</span> Penney left.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""J.C. Penney brought people to the mall,"" said Joseph Nguyen, who operates a jewelry-repair kiosk near the food court and was one of the retailers whose sales fell off.

</span>Southlake occupied what was considered prime real estate in suburban Clayton County when the property was built just off <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 75 in</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1976.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Housing developments were springing up as the city expanded southward, bringing in new residents and eager shoppers.

</span>Over the past decade, however, Southlake's fortunes have turned. Newer shopping destinations in neighboring Henry County pulled customers away. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Clayton County lost jobs when a nearby Ford Motor Co. plant closed <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> The mall took a further hit when Clayton County dropped bus service two years ago.

Southlake lost its first anchor <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> when Macy's closed one of its two stores at the mall. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unable to find another retail tenant, General Growth Properties, which bought the mall <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> turned the space into offices and a convention center.</span> General Growth filed for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span> protection <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 and</span> emerged <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> A year later, Penney left Southlake mall.

While the mall's occupancy rate has remained <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 90%,</span> Southlake has lost several national players, including The Limited and Gap clothing chains and the Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant.

""Two anchors aren't enough to draw people to the mall,"" said Michelle Laidig, who has worked at Southlake <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>. ""The mall used to be a destination. Now the locals just come here to return items they bought at other malls.""

The future may be turning around. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Vintage Real Estate LLC, which acquires and redevelops underperforming malls, bought Southlake in April for an undisclosed price and plans to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $3 million</span> to revitalize the property.

</span>""We talked to every tenant,"" Vintage Chairman Fred Sands said. ""We found out how they are doing and what the facility needs.""

Mr. Sands said he is negotiating with new restaurants for the food court and is interviewing tenants to take over the former Penney space.

The chairman disputes the idea that the mall was hurt by Penney's closing. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Sales excluding newly opened or closed stores have held steady at <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $320 per</span> square foot <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to documents Mr. Sands provided.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lost business from Penney was offset by increased sales from the mall'<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 16 shoe</span> retailers, including Foot Locker and Athlete's Foot, he said.

</span>RaeQuel Fagin, a 20-year-old-restaurant worker who met a friend at the food court on a recent Tuesday afternoon, said the mall was a good place to come for sneaker releases, but not for much else.

""I wouldn't say this is where I would come if I felt like shopping,"" Ms. Fagin said.

Sitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors. Parliamentarians had a sharp riposte: They called the police.

The two company board members had argued they needed permission from their investors before they disclosed details of the deal. But soon after a police officer showed up, the executives were fumbling with their paperwork, according to lawmakers who attended the hearing—but in the end, they didn’t release any documents.

The executives were escorted out of the parliamentary building and into a police truck. They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.

“Companies must accept the era of secrecy is over,” says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament’s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.

TPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania’s ministry of energy and minerals didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.

</span>Zambia’s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.

And in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> “It’s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=""9"" class=""red"">income, but not necessarily transparency,” says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.

</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.

“The deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,” says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The African Governance Initiative—headed by Mr. Blair—has helped Rwanda become the region’s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.

</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz’s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.

Mr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness—partly funded by the Soros Foundation—which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Condé’s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth—a claim the government rejects.

Simandou’s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto’s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called “baseless and bizarre.”

In Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Kabwe’s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway’s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers—well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

</span>Tanzania <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa’s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.

Mr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament’s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn’t comply with a Nov.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 deadline</span>—at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.

An official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.

ExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was “balanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.” He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.

But Mr. Rostad said he wouldn’t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn’t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.

Abortion access is at stake in GOP-run states that could elect Democratic governors

The future of abortion access in a handful of battleground states may rest with who wins the governor’s mansion in November.

Democrats are leaning into that message on the campaign trail, seeking to make the November elections a referendum on what they describe as the Republican Party’s extreme position on abortion. This dynamic is playing out in gubernatorial contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona — all of which have GOP-controlled state legislatures.

“The landscape changes from state to state, but our message has stayed focused on making sure voters know what a Republican can do to either chip away at current rights or advance existing restrictions,” said Christina Amestoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.

The notion of abortion access changing by the party in power is driving increased attention to statewide races up and down the ballot, even as control of Congress hangs in the balance of this year’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, GOP officials believe the party has a chance to make inroads with late-deciding voters, particularly as the months pass since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, our colleague Annie Linskey reported yesterday.

What the Michigan midterms mean for the future of abortion

Gretchen Whitmer (D) and activists explain <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Proposal 3,</span> a midterm ballot measure which would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. (Video: Hannah Jewell, Lindsey Sitz, Ross Godwin/The Washington Post, Photo: Emily Elconin/The Washington Post)

The landscape: The midterms are less than five weeks away. Voters <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 states</span> will choose their governor — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 Republicans</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 Democrats</span> holding offices that will be up for election this year.

Groups on both sides of the abortion debate — such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and SBA Pro-Life America — are pouring their resources into governor’s races.

Here are the key contests we’re watching:

Wisconsin: Gov. Tony Evers (D) is in a competitive race against Republican nominee Tim Michels. The state has a pre-Roe ban on the books, which Evers filed a lawsuit to repeal and the state’s Democratic attorney general has said he won’t enforce. However, clinics halted all abortion procedures shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is running against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. Abortion in the state is legal after a state judge invalidated a pre-Roe ban on the procedure. Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.

But even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure. That’s because voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November.

Arizona: Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) are fighting to fill this open seat. Earlier this year, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who is term-limited — signed legislation banning abortion <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 15 weeks</span>. However, an Arizona judge revived a near-total ban on abortion dating back to the mid-19th century a day before the 15-week limit was set to go into effect.

Pennsylvania: This is another contest with no incumbent. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) are fighting to succeed the state’s Democratic governor. Abortions are still legal in the state, but that could change if Mastriano wins and the GOP-controlled legislature sends restrictions on the procedure to his desk.

Georgia: This gubernatorial battle is a redo <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span> Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is again facing Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. The state has a ban on abortion after fetal cardiac activity, which is at roughly six weeks.

Democrats are working to keep the midterms focused on abortion, believing the issue is a powerful motivator to drive voters to the ballot box. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, those efforts are colliding with increased Republican efforts to focus on crime and the economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationally, recent Google News searches for inflation have been about even with inquiries on abortion.</span> This is the case for battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, Annie reports.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">* “The moderate and independent voters needed to build winning coalitions in competitive governors races are worried about the economy, crime, and education,” Joanna Rodriguez, a Republican Governors Association spokesperson, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span></span> The focus on abortion shows to those voters that Democrats “not only don't care about their greatest concerns, but also that they have no plans to address them,” Rodriguez said.,

Here's one interesting figure: Democrats in local, statewide and congressional races across the country have vastly outspent Republicans on advertising on abortion. Since Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Democrats have spent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $236 million</span>. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $62 million</span>, according to AdImpact, which tracks commercials. (h/t Azi Paybarah, who crunched the numbers for us.)

Meanwhile,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 66 clinics</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 15 states</span> have stopped offering abortions, according to a report out today from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 40 are</span> offering services other than abortion, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 26 have</span> shut down.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Biden administration’s Project Covid Shield hits a snag

The Biden administration’s plan to create a new accelerator for coronavirus vaccines and treatments has hit a standstill, complicated by fading interest among the public and lawmakers alike to continue treating the pandemic as a priority, Politico reports.

</span>Now, senior health officials are raising alarm bells about the nation’s defenses against the rapidly evolving virus without a long-term operation to ensure that its arsenal of tools stay up-to-date with the latest variants.

Key context: The initiative, dubbed Project Covid Shield, was intended to serve as a follow up to Operation Warp Speed, a Trump-era program that doled out federal dollars to private drugmakers to speed up the production of coronavirus vaccines. Officials had hoped to replicate the approach with new candidates to continue developing increasingly advanced shots and therapeutics to fight the virus — all while maintaining the nation’s edge in the global war against covid-19, Politico’s Adam Cancryn and Erin Banco write.

The White House has yet to secure <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $8 billion</span> from Congress it says it needs to get Project Covid Shield off the ground due to a stalemate with Republicans over new coronavirus aid. Meanwhile, even GOP lawmakers open to the concept have categorized the administration’s effort to date as disorganized and vague.

Americans give failing marks to U.S. health-care system

New this a.m.: Nearly half of adults give the country’s health care system a poor or failing grade, according to a new West Health-Gallup poll, which found that Americans across party lines see lobbying and partisan politics as major barriers to finding solutions to address the rising costs of medicine.

By the numbers:

* Sixty-six percent of Americans report their household pays too much relative to the quality of care that it receives, up six points compared with April of last year, according to the poll, which surveyed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,5000 adults</span>., * <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> report that cost is an important factor when considering a recommended medical procedure or medication., *</span> Half the country — an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 129 million</span> adults — have low levels of confidence that they can afford health care as they age., * Two in three Americans <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 65 believe</span> Medicare will not exist when they reach the age of eligibility.,

First in The Health 202: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist, is rolling out a campaign attacking pharmacy benefit managers often known as drug middlemen. In a new 20-page pamphlet, Carter alleges that PBMs use “various tactics to limit patient medication and increase drug costs” and includes interviews with patients.

It’s another salvo in the drug-pricing wars, where PBMs and other industry players spar over who’s driving up the costs. Carter points to various pieces of legislation he wants to see passed, such as a bill he introduced that would ban the use of spread pricing in Medicaid managed care. Spread pricing is when PBMs charge payers more than they pay to the pharmacy and keep the difference.

PBMs hit back. “Americans consistently reject the use of blame game tactics, especially when real patients’ health and lives are at stake,” JC Scott, the president of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span> “This is especially true when it comes to blaming PBMs, the one entity reducing costs in the health care system,” Scott said.

* The anonymous woman who accused Herschel Walker of urging her to have an abortion and paying for the procedure revealed that she is the mother of one of his children, after Walker claimed he had no clue about her identity, the Daily Beast reports., * A 14-year-old Arizona patient was initially denied her rheumatoid arthritis medication after the state’s abortion ban took effect last month because the drug can also be used to terminate pregnancies, our colleague María Luisa Paúl writes., * Public health officials are warning Florida’s contaminated waterways following Hurricane Ian could pose a short-term risk to people’s health if they’re exposed, The Post’s Kasha Patel reports., * The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is seeking public input as it develops a National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services, which is meant to serve as a centralized hub for medical workers’ and facilities’ directory information.,

The outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.

</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours—and therefore more money—at the parks because they are having such a good time.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The biggest change in the past two years—and the most lucrative for Disney—is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as “standby.”</span> But Genie+ doesn’t cover everything. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $10 to</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free—from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes—have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.

Disney’s theme-park pricing is determined by “pure supply and demand,” said a company spokeswoman.</span> “No different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For the quarter that ended <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.65 billion</span>.

Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks “extremely commercially successful.”

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney’s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney’s U.S. parks fell <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn’t disclose attendance for its theme parks.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls “legacy fans,” or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.

</span>“Disney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,” said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue—the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits—but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.

</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.

“Those people would have stayed all day,” he said. “They would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.”

Since its introduction in the fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.

Disney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%,</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,599 from</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can’t visit, angering some of the park’s most ardent fans.

</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 film</span> “Avatar.” A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The parks business has buoyed Disney’s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.

</span>Mr. D’Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney’s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn’t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D’Amaro was stopped more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members—as Disney employees are known in company lingo—who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro said he’s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors’ trips.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Demand has not abated” at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn’t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.

</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.

</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.

The family spent <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,000</span>—most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada’s in-laws—on admission, meals and lodging at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog.” And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.

“The memories are worth more than gold,” she said. “Even if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.”

Some longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren’t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.

“I just really resent the nickel-and-diming,” said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span>

“I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he’s there with me,” Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn’t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.

But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can’t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words “Chapek Killed The Magic” on it — a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.

</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone “are amongst our most special guests.”

<span id=""27"" class=""red"">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an “unfavorable attendance mix” at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading “Unfavorable” in protest.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Disney said that “unfavorable mix” is financial parlance meant for investors, and “not a consumer term.”

</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.

<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.

</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">But after tallying up the costs of this year’s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.

</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Despite the family’s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.

Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span>’ drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they’ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.

“Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,” she said.

The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service—along with a free version, known simply as Genie—does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks’ operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.

Each park has an operation center with a “heat map” that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.

“If I’m seeing too much activity on the west side, I’m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,” Mr. D’Amaro said. “Our attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.”

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.1%.</span>

Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.

“A lot of people will say, ‘Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,’ ” she said. “But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it’s so important. I can always make more money.”

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 11</span>:00 pm ET

NINGDE, China—The price of nickel, a metal used to make stainless steel for everything from sauce pans to guitar strings, spiked <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past $50,000 a</span> metric ton <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 from</span> less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10,000 just</span> a few years earlier.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">With nickel largely controlled by Western companies, China's swelling economy was especially vulnerable—until some of its steel producers figured out how to substitute a lower-grade ""nickel pig iron,"" unlocking a mother lode of cheap supply.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The country now turns out more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.

</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12% from</span> recent peaks; it had roughly tripled <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span></span> Copper is <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 28% from</span> its record high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> while thermal coal has fallen by more than half since <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2008 peak</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Of course, price declines are also driven by weaker demand, especially in China, where economic growth has slowed.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And prices for many commodities, including oil, remain far above their average <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10 or</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 years</span> ago.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the global supply picture is the best in years.</span> ""It's kind of basic econ 101: Scarcity induces some sort of innovation,"" said David Jacks, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has studied commodity cycles over the past century.

The most widely known innovation is the oil-field technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which fueled the shale boom by injecting water and other materials into the earth to unlock oil and natural gas.

But in agriculture, farmers are tapping new patches of arable land, and turning to higher-yielding hybrid seeds.

In the mining industry, drilling companies are using diamond-coated drill bits to reach miles farther beneath the earth's surface. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They also employ aircraft radar to map the geology of remote areas.</span> Firms that mix chemicals into minerals to make desired metals rise to the top or sink to the bottom now extract more product than ever from lower-grade deposits.

On top of all that, many projects that were funded years ago—including new or expanded copper, silver and nickel mines—have started producing.

As as result, mine production has nearly doubled or tripled for every major metal over the past two decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> aluminum output increased <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 45.7 million</span> metric tons <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 24.7 million</span>, according to the Raw Materials Group Stockholm, a consultancy. Production of iron ore, used in steelmaking, hit two billion metric tons from <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 975 million</span> over the same period.

Global production of corn, meanwhile, rose by <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 270 million</span> metric tons over the past decade, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That growth was the biggest 10-year increase on record and more than triple the gains of the previous decade.

Output of palm oil, used in cookies and instant noodles, has more than doubled since the start of the last decade, and so has the harvest of walnuts and almonds.

All this expanded production has often come with environmental costs, which in various places include air pollution, clear-cut forests and water tainted by chemicals.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And it remains unclear how the world can sustain the commodity-production gains still needed to meet future demand.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Per capita consumption of energy and other resources in China remains lower than in the West, which means more production increases will be needed in the future as the Chinese economy grows.</span> Many easy-to-reach minerals have been exhausted, likely raising future production costs.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But innovations of the past decade show how market signals help unlock new supply.</span> The period compares with advances in copper production during the 1920s, Mr. Jacks said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And demand during World War II led to the expansion of synthetic rubber production.

</span>Minerals companies, for example, have improved the chemical process to extract raw materials from waste rock. Rio Tinto in Utah extracts silver, gold and molybdenum from the muddy sludge that is a byproduct of mining copper. In Minnesota, a company called Magnetation Inc. has developed machines that use magnets to extract iron ore from mining waste.

China's nickel production is one of the most dramatic examples of fresh thinking. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">In the early 2000s, prices were <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $10,000 per</span> metric ton.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Then China's economy took off, along with new demand for stainless steel, which requires nickel and iron.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Nickel prices <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed $51,000 per</span> ton in mid-2007.

</span>Chinese stainless steel producers were furious, especially since much of the world's nickel supplies were dominated by such foreign companies as BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA of Brazil, and Russia's MMC Norilsk Nickel.

Most nickel production at the time came from so-called sulfide deposits in places like Canada and Russia, where mines were being depleted.

There were plenty of lower-grade laterite deposits in Indonesia and elsewhere. It could be refined into nickel pig iron, which contains a relatively small portion of nickel—usually less than 15%—mixed with iron. But processing the laterite ore required lots of energy and created lots of pollution.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Analysts figured it <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $20,000 or</span> more per metric ton to make nickel pig iron, more than double the market price for nickel in the early 2000s.</span> Mining companies often tossed laterite nickel aside.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But when nickel prices climbed, China saw a competitive advantage: it still had scores of old, inefficient blast furnaces.</span> Beijing had been pressing steelmakers to shut them down. But with some fine-tuning, the blast furnaces could refine laterite ore into nickel pig iron, which can be used to make some steel alloys, including stainless steel.

Early Chinese producers burned coal, oil, wood chips and other materials to refine the laterite, which came mostly from Indonesia. The final product had only a small amount of nickel, but also iron, both needed ingredients.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As prices continued to climb, nickel pig iron became economical, and furnaces along China's eastern coast were put to work.

</span>The Tsingshan Holding Group was among the leaders. As one of China's major producers of stainless steel, it needed lots of nickel.

The company was encouraged by early trials with nickel pig iron, but the refining process was still crude and dirty. So Tsingshan began experiments, including at a plant near Ningde, a coastal town in Fujian province surrounded by low green mountains and grape farms.

The company tried rotary kiln electric furnaces, which use less energy than blast furnaces and can extract more nickel from the ore.

Many people were skeptical, said John Li, a Tsingshan-subsidiary vice president in Ningde. One day, he said, a furnace started leaking iron slag everywhere.

But the process eventually succeeded, trimming electricity needs by as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40%,</span> said Jiang Xinfang, president-director of another Tsingshan subsidiary in Shanghai. Tsingshan now pumps out nickel pig iron <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11% nickel</span>, the company said, compared <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2% or</span> less using older techniques.

""At its core, this is a sort of revolution in the way nickel units are made,"" said Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore.

Tsingshan now gets about half the nickel it needs from its own nickel pig iron, Mr. Li said. At its Ningde-area operations, a port unloads ships of Indonesian ore, which is piled in tall dark-brown mounds that cover an area roughly the size of a football field.

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Later, the ore is transferred to a smelting plant where it is fed into a tangle of rust-colored pipes, smokestacks and rotating kilns for conversion into liquid nickel pig iron.

</span>A blanket of foul-smelling smog envelops areas near Tsingshan's operation, though there are many other factories nearby, making it hard to know where all the pollution comes from. Some residents blame the pig iron plant.

Analysts say mining of Indonesian ore involves destructive stripping of the land in that country, as well.

But the rotary-kiln process has made refining significantly cleaner, according to analysts. Mr. Jiang at Tsingshan said his company's newest-generation operations include antidust equipment and low-sulfur coal.

Tsingshan's breakthroughs have been replicated across China. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As nickel pig iron technology has improved, analysts say, the cost of processing it has fallen to as low <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $12,500 per</span> metric ton.

</span>""There's been this huge deflationary effect on the nickel industry as nickel pig iron has developed,"" said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays in London. ""It certainly has destroyed the world"" for traditional nickel, added Jim Lennon, a nickel expert and consultant to Australia's Macquarie Bank, though supplies could tighten again in the future.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">One concern for producers is that Indonesia may restrict exports of nickel ore next year to entice mining companies to build refining operations there.</span> Tsingshan is one of several companies taking steps to do so.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Western miners are scrambling to deal with the new supply.</span> Analysts estimated that as much <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40% of</span> the nickel mining industry is losing money these days. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some predict China will keep finding ways to supply its own needs.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore-Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest nickel miner, said earlier this year he was pessimistic about the metal's future price.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In October, his company announced it would mothball its Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic because of falling nickel prices, eliminating as many <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1,000 jobs</span>.</span> The company mines nickel ore in five countries, including Indonesia and sells much of it to China to make nickel pig iron.

""China is becoming self-sufficient"" in nickel, said Vladimir Potanin, chief executive of Norilsk, the world's top nickel producer. ""They are producing steel, which they need for their industrial development. They need this nickel pig iron close to where the steel is made. I think they're smart enough, and powerful enough to keep doing both forever.""

Mr. Li, of the Tsingshan subsidiary, was pleased with his country's revamping of nickel production, with benefits extending around the world. ""If we didn't have this nickel process in China,"" he said. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I think prices would <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $80,000.</span></span>""

61624,"<h3>Americans’ Declining Taste for Bud Weighs on AB InBev</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Brewer posts rise in profit but U.S. market still proves a challenge

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 12</span>:31 pm ET

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still has a way to go in its quest to woo increasingly fickle American drinkers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The brewer behind Budweiser and Bud Light on Thursday said U.S. revenue <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.1% in</span> the second quarter on the back of lower volumes, as both brands continued to lose market share.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The weak performance was a factor in the company missing overall sales growth forecasts, prompting shares to drop more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5%.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sales of the two brands have fallen as once-loyal American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.

</span>In response, the company is trying to persuade consumers to buy more expensive beers, rolling out Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, made with organic grains, and Bud Light Orange, brewed with citrus peels. It also plans to launch pricier variants of Budweiser, including a beer aged on bourbon barrel staves, due to begin selling next month.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said there was “no silver bullet, no short term answer to some of the problems we face,” in the U.S., although he added the company’s efforts to innovate and go upmarket were bearing fruit.

</span>AB InBev pointed to some signs of improvement, noting quarterly share losses in the U.S. had slowed, with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.35 percentage</span> point drop in the last quarter its best quarterly performance in almost four years. It said Michelob Ultra—marketed as a beer for people with an active lifestyle—continued to perform well.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall, AB InBev reported a jump in net profit <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.94 billion</span> for the three months to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.5 billion</span> a year earlier, as lower costs helped offset <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% fall</span> in revenue <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $14.01 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Stripping out currency changes and acquisitions, sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 4.7%,</span> missing analyst estimates for growth <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.4%.</span></span> Shares <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 4.2% in</span> Brussels following the results.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">While some multinationals have said tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are pushing up costs, Mr. Dutra said AB InBev’s costs haven’t risen yet as the company is still protected by hedges.</span> It will begin to feel the impact from these next year.

Outside of the U.S., results were buoyed by Brazil, Mexico, China and Western Europe, helped by the soccer World Cup in Russia, and AB InBev’s efforts to sell pricier drinks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The World Cup didn’t help sales in the U.S., where viewership was lower than for past tournaments as a result of the American team’s failure to qualify.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">AB InBev said its sponsorship of the soccer tournament was an opportunity to boost sales of Budweiser in international markets as revenue for the beer outside of the U.S. was up by more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10%.</span>

</span>Volume growth in Brazil was slightly hampered by a truck strike, offsetting gains from the World Cup.

The company also announced some organizational changes to spur growth.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It will combine ZX Ventures, a unit founded <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 to</span> develop new products for emerging consumer needs, with its marketing arm.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The innovation unit in April bought a U.K.-based spirits, e-commerce and import business.

</span>“In order to continue to grow, we have anticipate the future,” said Chief Executive Carlos Brito on a call with investors. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bringing the two units together “will help us achieve our objective of anticipating market and consumers trends,” he added.

</span>AB InBev is also creating a new position: a head of nonalcoholic beverages. Millennials and so-called “Generation Z” are drinking less than older generations, spurring booze makers to launch more low-alcohol and nonalcoholic products.

Nonalcoholic drinks—which mostly include energy drinks and nonalcoholic beers—make up more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> AB InBev’s volumes.

The company is also restructuring its management, collapsing nine geographical divisions into six in a move it said would help it become more agile following its integration of SABMiller, the London-based brewing giant it acquired <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

28411,"<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump’s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, “President Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has — with varying degrees of seriousness — floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.”
Greenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. As such, even though it <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">boasts 836,000 square</span> miles of territory — more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. — it counts a population of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 55,000.</span>
In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development, so it’s no wonder Trump, real estate man, wants to take a crack at developing it — on behalf of the nation, if not for himself. Indeed, wits were quick to riff on what a Trumpified Greenland would look like.
Needless to say, the Journal’s report sparked a wide variety of reactions; the Danish government immediately said “no,” while one New York City tabloid laughed, even as other organs of the mainstream media heaped on their own ridicule. Not surprisingly, one MSNBC talking head went beyond attacking Trump to attack Trump supporters, chortling, “Can anybody at the MAGA rally point out Greenland on a map?”
In response, Trump kept the door open, telling reporters on August 18:
Strategically, it’s interesting, and we’d be interested, but we’ll talk to them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow added:
We’re looking at it …</span> Greenland is a strategic place. They’ve got a lot of valuable minerals … the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.
A few others were supportive; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) tweeted on August 15:
This a smart geopolitical move. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Indeed, America’s strategic interest in Greenland has long been recognized.</span> As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the U.S. has tried, twice, to buy Greenland — once after the Civil War and again after World War Two. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(During WWII, Uncle Sam used Greenland for military basing and supply; to this day, there’s a major Air Force base at Thule, less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 miles</span> from the North Pole.)
</span>In fact, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1917,</span> America purchased the Danish West Indies from Denmark; we <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span>, renaming them the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Indeed, in its history, the U.S. has bought plenty of land, including the Louisiana Territory from the French <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1803 and</span> Alaska from the Russians <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1867.</span> In each case, the pittance Uncle Sam spent was repaid a thousand-fold, not just because of the natural resources involved, nor just because expansive land helped Americans spread out and own their own property, but also because, by taking possession of that territory, we kept a hostile power from possessing it. (We can pause to consider how much more difficult America’s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)
So now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven’t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it’s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we’re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.
Moreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don’t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.
So why haven’t they looked? It’s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And that’s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it’s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their “enlightened eco-consciousness,” even as Greenlanders stay poor.
Yet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.
Of course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They’d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.
So we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That’s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America’s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That’s a lot of wealth — six times America’s annual GDP, six times our national debt — and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.
</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What’s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.
There’s a good reason — a cosmic reason, one might say — why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that’s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table — from copper to iron, from silver to gold — were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets — and including our earth.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">So that’s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.
</span>Now here’s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.
Indeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most “experts.” You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an “energy crisis,” and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.
Yet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.
</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.
So now, looking to the future, there’s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.
Of course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they’re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.
Yet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there’s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.
So how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there’s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees — call that organic carbon capture.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means — industrial or biological — would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.
</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with — to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy — and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it’s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.
After all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures — applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world’s coolest carbon sink.
And if we need energy in Greenland, and we don’t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options — if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there’s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there’s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.
So let’s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the “Overton Window” — that is, the range of acceptable political discourse — reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.
One fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.
There may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA — Make Greenland Great Again.

49697,"<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.
The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we’d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.
You’ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians’ behalf <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe’s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.
But before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia’s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia’s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.
There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent’s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the ’80s, the resort’s hey-decade,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.
Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013 none</span> of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Then last April, a French consortium signed a contract with Kosovo’s Trade and Industry Ministry to bring Brezovica back to life; the plan was so ambitious that many locals weren’t sure if it was true.</span> A group of some of the world’s biggest leisure resort development firms — MDP Consulting, the engineering firm Egis and the Compagnie des Alpes, the world’s largest ski area management company behind French ski resorts like Val d’Isère, Tignes and Méribel — agreed to invest half a billion dollars, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 410 million</span> euros, over the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 17 years</span> to make Brezovica one of the largest, if not the largest, mountain resorts in the Balkans. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to Jill Jamieson, a consultant who has worked on the finance package, that is the single largest private investment in the country since the war, if not ever.
</span>The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer.</span> When complete, the resort, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8,000 acres</span>, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 feet</span>. The number of hotel beds will grow <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 700 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,000 </span>— three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 100 miles</span> of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.
</span>Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it’s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo’s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.
And yet there is hope.
“If we can do this, we can do anything,” said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.
Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.
Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica’s but that’s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.
I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.
“What time will the lifts start running?” I asked.
“You mean, if they start running,” Igor replied.
That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for €7 — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $9 at</span> the time — the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort’s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was some of the best skiing I’d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.
This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sometime <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort’s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.
Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort’s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.
I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.
“It went up like paper,” said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. “What am I going to do?” he asked. “You pick yourself up and move on. What else.”
Stoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a €180 million expansion <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament’s self-tear-gassing attacks.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The resort’s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you’ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The resort could provide as many <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 30 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58 percent</span> of the work force is “inactive.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region’s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 645,000 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.
Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.
“Kosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,” said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. “Brezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Maybe so, but “it’s just hugely important to be sure it’s done right,” said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are “thoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.”
Across the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> “tourist city” with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia’s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia’s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent €30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.
If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it’s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area’s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> In the ’70s he built a hut that would become Tina’s pizzeria under Igor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything — the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn’t the issue.
“We’re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,” Igor said. “The mountains are in me.”
Over the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren’t running. The Dane guys weren’t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.
I lounged around Tina’s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina’s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: “Stupid politicians caused it.” On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: “We never have an argument.” On why I should not clear the table: “This is Balkans,” Draginja said. “Women do this.”
I helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria’s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.
“There is something beautiful when everything is broken,” Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. “Everyone comes together.”
On the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.
I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals €5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or “meadow” in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko’s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn’t have one. I asked where to buy it.
“No, no, you don’t need a ticket,” said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant’s palm. “Come, come,” my new friend said, and off we went.
Rexhep Krasniqi,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58,</span> had fled <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> “We are good at surviving,” he said.
I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">A single ride cost <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11.</span>
Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $380 a</span> month.</span> “No more corruption,” a local told me later, “but less skiers.”
We picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion’s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.
Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5 bill</span>. “No Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,” he said, politely but firmly. “You are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.”
My last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.
We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn’t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.
Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina’s once stood, and the legs I’d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.
It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don’t you long for it to stay the way it is?
Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.
Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.
IF YOU GO
Getting There
Pristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.
What You Should Know
This winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It’s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn’t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.
Guides
Hiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).
Transfers and Lift Tickets
Expect to pay <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Lift tickets now cost €20 a day.</span>"

DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?
Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)
Founders may think twice about selling to Facebook
Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.)
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.”
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
</span>SoftBank’s founder has the biggest dreams in tech
Masa Son has raised <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that’s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund’s team of deal makers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 300.</span> Counting him, it’s currently ten.
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee’s chairman, said in an opening statement.
</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
</span>Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,” Mr. Thune concluded. “But I suspect we probably wouldn’t get it acted on until next year.”

Coming up today
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey, who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, will testify first, starting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 a</span>.m. Eastern. Judge Kavanaugh is also expected to be questioned about accusations from other women, including one who came forward yesterday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Steven Mnuchin might talk trade.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary, who has kept a low profile recently, is scheduled to speak at a Washington event sponsored by The Hill.
</span>The Commerce Department will release second-quarter G.D.P. data. Analysts expect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2 percent</span> annualized growth rate.
The Census Bureau will publish durable goods order numbers for August. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They are forecast to have risen <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.2 percent</span>, having <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 1.7 percent</span> in July because of shrinking demand for transportation equipment.
</span>Fox admits defeat over Sky
Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 39 percent</span> stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $15 billion</span>. It’s the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.
Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch’s media empire.
Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $15 billion</span> for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it’s <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $15 billion</span> spent on an asset that many didn’t want in the first place.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed stands up to Trump
It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25 percent</span>, citing a “particularly bright moment” for the U.S. economy.</span> President Trump said he was “not happy.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
</span>For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell, intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2020.</span> That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Could Treasuries end the bull market?
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3 percent</span> a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more.</span> Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.

92537,"<h3>U.K. Inflation Tops 10%, Underlining Gloomy Outlook for Europe</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Rising energy costs are likely to push European inflation rates higher even as U.S. inflation shows signs of cooling

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 11</span>:10 am ET

The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation moved into double digits in July and is set to rise even higher by the end of the year, heaping greater pressure on stretched household budgets and threatening a lengthy economic contraction.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That pickup in inflation has been replicated in other parts of Europe, even as consumer prices have started to slow in the U.S.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The U.K.’s Office for National Statistics Wednesday said consumer prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 10.1% higher</span> in July than a year earlier, up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.4% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That was the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades and the fastest increase in prices recorded in one of the Group of Seven rich countries since the current surge started in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Inflation figures continue to paint a worrying picture for consumers and businesses alike, and price pressures are set to build further,” said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Figures to be released Thursday by the European Union’s statistics agency are expected to show the eurozone’s annual rate of inflation rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.9% in</span> July <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 8.6% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">By contrast, U.S. inflation eased <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5% in</span> July <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.1% in</span> June.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists at JPMorgan see increasing signs that global inflation is set to ease, with prices of food and many commodities down from recent peaks.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, they expect that disinflation to be evident first in the U.S., with Europe set to lag behind despite some recent easing in the prices of goods leaving factory gates.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Europe, however, faces ongoing pressure from surging natural gas prices that have more than doubled over the past three months,” they wrote in a note to clients.</span> “We expect the combined drag of a squeeze on purchasing power and depressed sentiment to tip the region into recession this year.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">July is unlikely to mark the peak in U.K. inflation, since household energy costs are set to rise sharply when a cap on prices is lifted in October.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Bank of England estimates that could send the annual rate of inflation <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 13% as</span> the year draws to a close.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The U.K. is suffering a particularly severe surge in prices in part because of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2016 decision</span> to leave the European Union, which has caused costs for importers to increase, while a weaker pound has also raised the prices of goods and services purchased overseas.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Brexit has also reduced the availability of foreign workers in some lower-paid services industries, such as hospitality, pushing costs and prices higher.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">However, the U.K. might not be the only one of Europe’s three G-7 members set to face the double-digit inflation that has already hit Spain, Greece and a number of the EU’s eastern members.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Germany’s gas regulator Monday announced a surcharge on gas prices designed to cover most of the increased costs to home energy suppliers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists estimate that will send Germany’s annual rate of inflation <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 10% from</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.5% in</span> July.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">U.K. figures released Tuesday by the ONS showed wages excluding bonuses <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 4.7% higher</span> in the three months through June than a year earlier, a pickup from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.4% rate</span> of growth recorded in the three months through May.

Much of the pickup came from the private sector, where wages were <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>9% when</span> bonuses are included.</span> Many businesses are giving workers one-off payments to help cover surging energy and food costs, as well as standard pay rises. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Labor union Unite on Monday said British Airways had agreed to pay its check-in staff a lump sum equivalent <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5% of</span> their salaries this month, with a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">regular 5% pay</span> rise to follow in September, and a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 3% increase</span> in January.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Like most other workers, our members in BA are struggling with the cost of living crisis,” said Oliver Richardson, a Unite official.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The acceleration in wage rises will worry the Bank of England, which wants to avert a self-reinforcing series of wage and price rises of the kind that kept inflation high for many years in the 1970s.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Investors now expect the central bank to raise its key interest rate by a half percentage point when policy makers next meet in mid-September, having broken with a quarter-century tradition of only increasing borrowing costs by a quarter point in each step earlier this month.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Today’s ugly inflation print combined with the stronger earnings read should keep the MPC on track to deliver multiple 50bps hikes this year,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> “Relative to our base case, risks are tilted to an even more front-loaded and protracted hiking cycle.”

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even as it picked up, wage growth fell further behind the rate of inflation, with the result that real wages <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 4.1%,</span> the largest decline since records began <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That blow to consumer spending threatens to push the economy into an even deeper contraction than the central bank already expects.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank is also seeking to strike a balance between tackling surging inflation and limiting the hit to the eurozone economy from higher energy prices.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It also broke with recent practice by raising its key rate by a half percentage point in July, and many economists expect it to repeat that move next month.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.K. government has already announced three packages of support to help households meet higher energy bills without having to cut back on other essentials, but economists expect a fourth package to follow the election of a new prime minister early next month.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The government’s response to what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis has been on hold since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted as head of the ruling Conservative Party in early July, and the lengthy process of choosing his successor is due to end on Sept.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“We’ll prepare all the options, ready for the incoming prime minister so that they can hit the ground running on what more we can do,” said Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.’s Treasury chief.

</span>The German government, and others in Europe, are also considering additional support for households that face skyrocketing energy costs.

“We’re putting together another relief package,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote in a tweet Monday. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">“We don’t leave anyone alone with the higher costs.”

Updated Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:01 am ET

Amir and Mojgan Moghadam <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1.4 million</span> on their new home in Irvine, Calif. But to make it absolutely perfect, they spent a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $550,000 on</span> builder upgrades—<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $28,200 for</span> a conservatory,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,600 for</span> a Sub-Zero ice maker <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $495 for</span> five exterior wall-light outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Buying a newly built home is a lot like buying a new car at the dealership—optional features cost extra.</span> Buyers will pay more for premium granite, a fancier fridge or an epoxy-coated garage floor. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">And upgrades can be a lucrative part of a builder's business, with profit margins as high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 60%,</span> depending on the option, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

</span>Indeed, buyers like the Moghadams are helping builders return to profitability after a long downturn. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">During the housing boom, homes were loaded with expensive features, and buyers snapped them up, regardless of price.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">These days, however, upscale buyers are choosier, selecting pricey options that are within their budgets and still practical for the resale market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">An <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 10% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30% of</span> a home's base price is spent on upgrades.</span> And companies say these optional features have been spurring growth in high-end home construction.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are driving much of this spending, with a 30-year, fixed-rate average <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.68% for</span> conforming loans, which are <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $417,000 in</span> most markets, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 4.13% for</span> larger loans, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-research website.</span> Monica Kaiser, for instance, added <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70,000 worth</span> of upgrades to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus San Diego home she and her husband purchased in December. The Kaisers decided to spend the money now—instead of later—for the upgrades they wanted. The Kaisers opted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10,000 staircase</span> with wrought-iron balusters and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4,500 for</span> tile and stonework in the home's 41⁄2 bathrooms, along with other features from builder Standard Pacific.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""With interest rates so low, you're not going to be able to get what you want any cheaper at any time,"" says Ms. Kaiser, a mother of three who works for local media outlet.</span> ""To put a lot of these upgrades in down the line would have just been silly, because we'd be paying more to take out a loan or dipping into other assets.""

Some builders present buyers with thousands of choices that let them build a near-custom home that won't resemble anything else in their community. Customizing a home can make a customer less likely to cancel the deal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""They're emotionally attached to what they have designed,"" says Joan Marcus-Colvin, senior vice president of sales, marketing and design for the New Home Co.</span> ""They have actually pictured themselves living in that surrounding.""

To this end, builders construct lavish model homes to showcase the full range of options. Toll Brothers, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., is known for models that ""pretty much upgrade everything,"" says Denise DiBlasio, who manages Toll's design studio in Bucks County, Pa. Toll will put a fireplace in the master bath or a wine grotto in the basement.

In North Palm Beach, Fla., Toll poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades for the model home at its upscale Frenchman's Harbor community, where single-family homes start <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.7 million</span>. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The company says it is not unusual for a buyer to replicate the model or to copy the kitchen, regardless of cost.

</span>Toll, like many other builders, has bricks-and-mortar design centers stocked with samples of everything from carpet colors to granite slabs that customers can touch and coordinate with other items. Interior-design specialists are on hand to guide buyers on what's hot and help them avoid design disasters.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The New Home Co., a three-year-old upscale builder in California with starting prices as high <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2 million</span>, took <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $9 million</span> from its design studios <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $7.6 million</span> the prior year.

</span>Publicly traded builders, who sell more homes but generally don't disclose profits from upgrades, can rake in much more. Jeffrey Burnett estimates he and his wife spent three full days at Toll's Boca Raton, Fla., design center, one <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 nationwide</span>, selecting extras for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $2.5 million</span> home under construction in Frenchman's Harbor. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the end, Mr. Burnett, chief executive officer of Labor Finders International, a nationwide blue-collar staffing company based in Palm Beach Gardens, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added $800,000 worth</span> of upgrades, including <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 tennis</span> court and a steam room.

</span>In the past decade, builders have increasingly been allowing buyers to pick favorite items through a website or app. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Buyers can almost think of it like a game: They choose options to build their dream homes, then add or delete items as the budget permits.

</span>""It was like I was going to the store,"" says Ms. Moghadam, the Irvine, Calif., buyer of the New Home Co. house. ""I would sit on my iPad and I would just pick out all the options I liked: cabinets, sinks, hardware, faucets. You could just do it at home and have fun with it.""

The most money is usually spent on kitchens, bathrooms and flooring, according to BDX, the marketing-services and technology company behind the Envision online design center that helps customers select options. Buyers upgrade <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooring 73% of</span> the time, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cabinets 70% and</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">appliances 63%,</span> the company says.

In the kitchen, large, granite-topped islands that seat four to eight people are popular, as are supersize showers with sitting space, says Jeffrey Lake, Standard Pacific's national head of architecture.

Northeasterners like crown molding and wainscoting, while Florida buyers often spring for a screened-in lanai and a bathroom specifically for the pool area. On the West Coast, consumers are more likely to add large glass doors that can be opened to seamlessly combine the family living space with the outdoors, he said.

Builders warn buyers to keep an eye on spending to avoid appraisal woes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">An extensively upgraded home could appear overvalued when compared with recent nearby sales.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">If that happens, the builder may have to cut the price or ask the buyer for extra money at the closing.</span> For that reason—and to help pay for the purchase and installation of the upgrade—some builders require upgrade deposits in advance. The Moghadams, whose purchase contract for extras <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 32 pages</span>, paid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50% of</span> their upgrades upfront, though that was spread across multiple payments.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">M.D.C. Holdings, a builder that operates under the Richmond American Homes name, may ask for an additional deposit if a buyer's interior-design upgrades <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 13% of</span> the base price.</span> Typically, the additional deposit <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50% of</span> the amount spent <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 13%.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Above 18%,</span> the buyer may have to place a deposit equal <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100% of</span> additional upgrades. The company may also ask buyers to pay for unusual choices upfront. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">""If you order the pink carpet, we're probably going to ask you to put the full deposit on that one,"" says Bob Martin, the Denver-based builder's vice president of finance and business development who is currently picking out upgrades for his new home.</span> ""Nothing against pink,"" he adds.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And, given consumer demand, more builders are making some upscale features—things like granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances—standard, even in lower-priced homes.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some builders, like Miami-based Lennar, purchase popular options in bulk at a discount and include them in the home's base price.</span> This approach appeals to buyers who don't want to make many decisions or feel nickel-and-dimed when opting for an upgrade like an extra electrical outlet.

One upgrade tends to hold its value: land. Former NFL player Michael Hamilton decided to build a new Standard Pacific home in San Diego after seeing a roughly half-acre lot with views of coastal sage shrub and other native plants <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,600 acres</span> of preserved open space.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Premium lots in the upscale Bellasario at Stonebridge Estates community cost up <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $215,000 above</span> the neighborhood'<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $900,000 base</span> price.</span> The upgraded lot gave Mr. Hamilton room for another upgrade, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 backyard</span> cottage for guests. ""I wanted that lot and I wanted the casita,"" he said, adding that ""I wish I would have gotten a couple more upgrades.""

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">It’s a wish list of economic help for low- and middle-income families:

·</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A push for a permanent increase in the child and dependent care tax credit — up <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $4,000 to</span> cover expenses related to care for a child <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 13 or</span> a dependent with a disability who needs care, and up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $8,000 for</span> two or more qualifying individuals.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">· Extending <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2025 the</span> increases in the child tax credit in the American Rescue Plan —<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $3,600 for</span> children <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 6 and</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $3,000 for</span> those older <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.</span>

· Lowering health-care premiums for millions of Americans who buy their health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

I want to believe change is coming. But we’ve been here before. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Grand plans made, then broken or stymied by a horribly partisan political system in which all too often policies favoring major corporations and special-interest groups trump the needs of the many.

</span>President Donald Trump made all kinds of promises about helping struggling Americans, too, in his first address to a joint session of Congress. Many of his plans were thwarted by the pandemic and a Congress so divided that members might struggle to agree the sky is blue on a sunny day.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Biden certainly said all the right things — about the need to increase the minimum wage and create jobs that could give people “a little breathing room.”</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But frankly, I’m concerned legislators are willing only to drop financial breadcrumbs to low- and middle-income households when an economic crisis hits.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Even at the depths of this coronavirus recession, many Senate Republicans were reluctant to endorse a big stimulus program — although it had Trump’s backing.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">We need long-term financial relief for people left further behind because of the pandemic.</span> Realistically, Biden’s got a short time before the next election cycle might take away the slight legislative leverage the Democrats wield in Congress.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the costs of inaction will further widen the economic divide.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a quarter of women say their family’s financial situation is worse today than before the coronavirus-related shutdowns.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Yes, the three rounds of stimulus payments made a huge difference, but just for a few weeks or months.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">When will we stop trying to solve systemic economic problems for low- and middle-income families with relief money that is given only begrudgingly — and then only because the powers that be fear it will upset Wall Street if they don’t.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">My Post colleague Allan Sloan wrote at the end of last year, “I think that many of the problems in our country stem from the division between the kind of people who benefit from government policies that support financial markets and stock prices, and the people short on financial assets who are left on their own to try to make a decent living and provide for their families at a time when inflation-adjusted wages have been eroding.”

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The Biden administration and many congressional Democrats want to increase the hourly minimum wage from a <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">measly $7.25 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $15 an</span> hour.

</span>It’s a popular proposal.

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults favor raising the federal minimum wage to<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $15 an</span> hour, according to a Pew Research Center survey in early April.</span> But there are sharp partisan differences, Pew said.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“Let’s raise the minimum wage <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $15,</span>” Biden said in his speech Wednesday night.</span> “... <span id=""19"" class=""red"">No one <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">working 40 hours</span> a week should live below the poverty line.”

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">At one point, Biden challenged the theory that if you lower the tax rate for corporations and the rich, they will, in turn, make moves that will stimulate the economy and ultimately help low- and middle-income America.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Trickle-down economics has never worked,” Biden said, “and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out.”

</span>He’s right. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As The Post reported last year, a compensation study looking at data <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spanning 50 years</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 18 countries</span> found that tax cuts for the rich simply enrich them.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">“We find that major reforms reducing taxes on the rich lead to higher income inequality,” said a London School of Economics and Political Science working paper by David Hope and Julian Limberg, adding, “Lower taxes on the rich encourage high earners to bargain more forcefully to increase their own compensation, at the direct expense of those lower down the income distribution.”

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">As I listened to Biden, I felt encouraged for the millions of Americans who feel financially lost.</span> His agenda for these struggling families is bold. But delivering on his promises will take a political miracle."
60670,"<h3>One Muslim’s Quest to Save a Revered Syrian Synagogue</h3>A Syrian Muslim Sought Help From Israel and American Jews

Updated Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 10</span>:33 pm ET

Maj. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli army spokesman, was taken aback when he received a message from a mysterious man writing from the heart of Syria’s bloody civil war.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The man, a Sunni Muslim who created a Facebook page called “Jobar Synagogue,” said he was on a mission to preserve his town’s crown jewel, a centuries-old religious site venerated by the three major religions.</span> Merely contacting the Israelis was an act that could have put his life in danger.

“If we do not move fast to protect this historical heritage, it will be lost forever,” he wrote to the Israeli major, via Facebook.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The exchange last year was part of a frantic mission to rescue the synagogue, located in the battle-worn Damascus suburb of Jobar.</span> The man behind the Facebook page, who uses the nom de guerre Abbas Abu Suleiman, got the attention of rabbis in Israel and New York, Syrian exiles in Washington and a Manhattan diamond-district salesman who visited the synagogue as a boy.

Mr. Suleiman hoped the Jewish community would intervene with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad not only to save the site, but to halt the bombardment of his hometown. Safeguarding a part of Syria’s multicultural religious heritage, he hoped, might help the country rebuild whenever the war was over.

Maj. Adraee gets as many <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 18,000 Facebook</span> messages each day, many berating him for Israel’s policies toward its neighbors. After receiving Mr. Suleiman’s plea, he didn’t know what to think. Was this man an ally? An opportunist? He replied to the Facebook message with a question mark.

Others contacted by Mr. Suleiman had a similar reaction. Jewish leaders on two continents worried about, among other things, whether intervening would endanger the tiny community of aging Jews remaining in Syria.

This account of Mr. Suleiman’s quest is based on interviews with him on Skype, transcripts of his Facebook chats and discussions with Muslim and Jewish leaders in the U.S., Syria and Israel. Mr. Suleiman asked The Wall Street Journal not to disclose his real name.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Jobar has been part of Jewish life in Syria for centuries.</span> An inscription that for years was part of the synagogue’s wall described it as the shrine of the Prophet Eliyahu Hanavi <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 720 B</span>.C. The synagogue has been rebuilt many times over the years, according to the chief rabbi of the Syrian Jews, Avraham Hamra.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Of Damascus’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 22 synagogues</span>, the one in Jobar is the most revered because it was built atop a cave where, according to religious teachings, the prophet Eliyahu concealed himself to avoid persecution.</span> Muslims and Christians regard Eliyahu as a prophet, making the site one of the few in Syria revered by all three religions.

Before the civil war, Jews, Muslims and Christians would visit the synagogue and take turns descending into the cave to pray. Inside was a stone chair believed to have been used by Eliyahu. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Syrians of different faiths believed saying a prayer in the cave would bless a new business venture and safeguard their health, Rabbi Hamra said.

</span>In the early 20th century, an <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 25,000 Jews</span> lived in Syria, split between Damascus and Aleppo, according to Abraham Marcus, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Texas at Austin. The Jews of Syria began to leave in the early 1900s. The exodus accelerated before the founding of Israel <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1948.</span>

Today, Rabbi Hamra said, there <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 17 Jews</span> left in Damascus and probably none in Aleppo, making it Syria’s smallest known religious minority. Nine are men, one short of a minyan, the quorum <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 Jewish</span> male adults required for certain religious obligations. All the Jews in Damascus <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 60 years</span> old or older.

Syria’s Jews have a complex relationship with the Assad regime. Many see him as a protector, and the opposition, dominated by groups aligned with al Qaeda, as the real threat. Government agents monitor the nation’s Jews, according to rabbis and government defectors, which circumscribes what they can do or say.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">When Mr. Suleiman started his quest, Jobar was under the control of opposition forces, as it still is.</span> Groups operating there included the Western-backed Free Syrian Army as well as the Nusra Front, which has ties to al Qaeda. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Jobar and other eastern Damascus suburbs are strategically significant as gateways to the capital, and have seen heavy fighting.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">In the security vacuum, thieves in Jobar looted the synagogue, taking prayer books, scrolls and the ornate interior doors, local activists say.</span> On one occasion, members of the FSA rescued some of the stolen items.

Local activists set up a special committee to protect the synagogue. Mr. Suleiman says he volunteered to take the lead.

In peaceful times, the synagogue had attracted visitors from Syria and beyond. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">More than just a religious site, it put Jobar on the map.</span> For the sake of the town, residents believed they needed to save it.

Before the war, Mr. Suleiman had worked as a manager at his family’s factory. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He had lived in Jobar for his whole life but had never gone inside the synagogue until the summer <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2012,</span> when he decided to help protect it.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Local Jobar leaders locked the doors and posted guards outside.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">On <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10 of</span> last year, Mr. Suleiman posted a message, using his Jobar Synagogue account, on the Arabic-language Facebook page of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">He explained what leaders in Jobar were doing to secure the site and asked whom they could contact about the antiquities.</span> He got no response.

He messaged Maj. Adraee, the Israeli Defence Force’s Arabic-language spokesman, later that month. “I tried to connect to many different entities and sources but with no luck,” he said in one message.

Next, he contacted Amine Helwani, one of Damascus’<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 17 remaining</span> Jews. Mr. Helwani and his brother used to visit the synagogue to make sure everything was in order, according to Rabbi Hamra.

Mr. Helwani replied in a series of Facebook messages. He said the war prevented anyone making the drive across town. He asked about an old Torah scroll and about the condition of the rugs.

Mr. Suleiman said he couldn’t find the Torah scroll, and that he had rolled up the rugs to protect them.

“May God protect you and guide you,” Mr. Helwani wrote back. He said the Jews in Damascus were in no position to help because of the constant fighting. “We can’t do anything,” he said. Mr. Helwani didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Helwani found one way to keep the effort rolling. He reached out to Henry Hamra, nephew of the Syrian chief rabbi, who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan’s diamond district. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Hamra had visited Jobar as a child growing up in Damascus.

</span>“Hi. How are you? My name is Henry Hamra,” he wrote to Mr. Suleiman via Skype in July of last year. He thanked Mr. Suleiman for taking care of the synagogue. “You are doing the best thing anybody could do without getting a reward,” he wrote. He suggested that Mr. Suleiman secure the religious items away from the synagogue.

He asked Mr. Suleiman to send pictures. One showed prayer books and two Torah scrolls in boxes. Another showed the synagogue after it was cleared out. Mr. Suleiman said he needed help—trucks and other equipment to protect the perimeter.

Mr. Hamra recalls that he wasn’t sure how to proceed. He contacted his uncle, the chief Syrian rabbi, who now lives in Holon, a working-class suburb near Tel Aviv. Rabbi Hamra cautioned his nephew against intervening. The first priority was to protect the remaining Jews in Damascus.

“I don’t want one fingernail of anyone to be hurt. I don’t want that. If I will deal with the opposition, then the government won’t forgive,” Rabbi Hamra recalls advising his nephew. “I will not speak against Assad and I will not speak against the opposition. I stand by the Jews of Syria.”

Mr. Hamra kept talking to Mr. Suleiman. They exchanged pictures of their young children. Mr. Hamra hoped to one day visit the synagogue with his children. When the two men talked, usually over a Skype connection, explosions and the sound of children playing could be heard in the background.

Israeli Maj. Adraee hadn’t responded to Mr. Suleiman when he wrote again in July of last year to say that “if the people of the house don’t want to protect their homes, then I have come to a dead end and I can no longer continue protecting the synagogue.”

Maj. Adraee wrote back: “?”

Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner says Maj. Adraee sometimes responds with a question mark if he wants further context or explanation. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“The efforts of the residents of Jobar are honorable and we certainly hope to see the appropriate organizations and bodies act on their behalf,” Lt. Col. Lerner says.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The following month, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2013,</span> the Assad regime launched what the U.S. and its allies called a large chemical-weapons attack, devastating Jobar and other nearby suburbs.</span> Mr. Suleiman says many local residents were killed, including members of his family.

When Mr. Hamra heard the news in New York, he sent frantic messages. Mr. Suleiman responded a few days later. Mr. Suleiman sent pictures of victims of the gas attack and told him to get the word out. “I didn’t know what to tell him,” Mr. Hamra recalls.

Their talks about lobbying and providing trucks and other equipment were going nowhere. Both men say their relations grew strained.

Mouaz Moustafa, an antiregime activist based in Washington, was introduced to Mr. Suleiman by a mutual acquaintance in the opposition movement. Mr. Moustafa, a Syrian of Palestinian origin, says he felt conflicted. Although his work put him in frequent contact with American officials and Jewish leaders, he didn’t want to be seen as working with the Israelis because that could hurt his relations with opposition activists.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He decided to approach Jewish leaders in New York, who he thought could help persuade Mr. Assad to ease the stranglehold on Jobar.</span> In the back of his mind, he says, was the distant prospect of engineering a prisoner swap that would free activists, women and children imprisoned by the regime.

The first meeting was with Rabbi Elie Abadie, whose family was from Aleppo and who now runs Congregation Edmond J. Safra in Manhattan. Mr. Moustafa had met rabbis before but never one who spoke Arabic and who shared his love of Fairuz, a Lebanese singer.

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Rabbi Abadie was intrigued but wasn’t sure “how much to trust the people in Jobar,” he recalls.</span> He too believed it was more important to protect the remaining Jews in Damascus.

Rabbi Abadie looked at pictures Mr. Suleiman had sent. He estimated the prayer books were maybe two centuries old. Other pictures showed Torah scrolls, one of which was so badly damaged that Rabbi Abadie thought it was no longer usable and should be buried, per Jewish custom.

The next stop in New York for Mr. Moustafa was Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Mr. Hoenlein had visited Syria <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 to</span> try to preserve Jewish sites and had met with Mr. Assad. He says he was skeptical of Mr. Suleiman’s requests for money and his ability to save the synagogue and its contents. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">He checked with contacts in Syria, who told him Jobar was largely impassable and in the hands of competing rebel units.

</span>“There was a lot of suspicion and mistrust,” says Marty Kalin, a Jewish American alarmed by the humanitarian crisis in Syria who accompanied Mr. Moustafa in New York.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. Hoenlein recalls that he and other Jewish leaders wanted to help but didn’t know whether Jobar residents could deliver on their promises to protect the synagogue.</span> They reached a consensus soon after: The risk of intervening was too high.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. Hoenlein says he worried that providing financial assistance to Jobar might prompt opposition forces in other parts of Syria to seek similar deals to protect other Jewish sites.

</span>Rabbi Abadie was disappointed with the result but agreed with the decision. “I am a Jew, but I realized that plenty of churches have been destroyed, plenty of mosques have been destroyed,” he says. “So I felt, ‘With what right could I scream foul play while other houses of worship have been destroyed equally?’ ”

A few weeks later, Rabbi Abadie was invited to an exhibit in New York of “important Judaica” put together by the auction house Sotheby’s. As he toured the exhibit, he noticed a wood carving from a Syrian synagogue with an inlaid ebony-and-bone border. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Sotheby’s catalog said: “This rare surviving artifact of the Jewish community at Jobar may be all that remains of this ancient and venerable community.”

Rabbi Abadie asked the curator to remove the item so he could examine it.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">He assumed Jobar’s residents were selling off looted antiquities.</span> “Oh, my goodness. These guys really are quick!’” he recalls thinking.

The curator checked the item’s notes. It had been taken from the synagogue in the early 1900s.

In the spring of this year, a rocket hit the back of the synagogue, punching a hole in the wall. Mr. Suleiman posted another message on Mr. Netanyahu’s Facebook page: “It seems like this issue means nothing to you all.”

In May, the synagogue took a direct hit from a shell. The damage was catastrophic.

Rabbi Hamra, who was at home in Holon when he heard the news, compares it to the destruction of the ancient temple in Jerusalem. “It felt like the world was destroyed,” he says. “It had such a special place in the world. But what could I do?”

Mr. Hoenlein says he is skeptical much survived the strike.

Mr. Suleiman says local residents went through the rubble and salvaged what they could. The cave, he says, is still intact. The safe house where the religious items were stored was hit by rockets. One of the scrolls was burned but most of the prayer books and other religious items were saved.

Mr. Suleiman posted pictures of the destroyed stone building on the synagogue’s Facebook page and sent a message to Mr. Netanyahu that linked to pictures of the rubble.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">He wrote: “The end of the Jobar synagogue at the hands of Bashar al-Assad.”

Central</span> bank seeks to avoid a recurrence of unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month
The Federal Reserve said it would buy short-term Treasury debt beginning next week to avoid a recurrence of the unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed will buy Treasury bills beginning next Tuesday at an initial pace <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $60 billion</span> a month and continue those purchases into the second quarter <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>
</span>The announcement Friday marked a U-turn for the central bank, which until August had been shrinking its <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4 trillion</span></span> asset portfolio.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed said the actions were “purely technical measures to support the effective implementation” of the rate-setting committee’s policy “and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.”
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Fed officials stopped shrinking the assets on their balance sheet this summer but never said when they would allow them to grow again.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">As a result, a crucial liability on the balance sheet—bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves—has continued to decline.
Stresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks had grown reluctant to lend those reserves and that the Fed may have let them to fall too low.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Reserves dropped to less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.4 trillion</span> last month, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed said its goal will be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system to levels of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $1.5 trillion</span> that prevailed in early September.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“This is a much needed bazooka from the Fed,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates at Bank of</span> America Corp. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“It shows the Fed is finally doing what is necessary to correct their mistake from dropping reserves too low.”
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Newsletter Sign-up
Changes in how the Fed administers its rate decisions and in bank regulation earlier this decade, along with increased government debt issuance over the past year, have made it harder for the Fed to determine how many reserves it could drain from the system.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“We’re in a period of time where the Fed and others are in a learning-by-doing mode,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at financial-services company Jefferies LLC.</span> “They have been making the right adjustments and, just as important, they are being very transparent about it.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the announcement in a speech Tuesday.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said the Fed’s funding plan would be designed to maintain a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates and not to provide economic stimulus.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed bought longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive stimulus campaigns <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2008 and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 that</span> became known as quantitative easing, or QE.
</span>“This is not QE,” Mr. Powell said Tuesday. “In no sense is this QE.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, officials will instead buy shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Fed’s rate-setting committee met by videoconference on Oct.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 to</span> discuss recent developments in money markets.</span> It approved the plans unanimously on Friday.
The committee last met on Sept. 17-18, as the spike in overnight funding markets occurred. Their next scheduled meeting is Oct. 29-30.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">The committee last made a policy change between its regularly scheduled policy meetings in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2010,</span> when it reopened a lending program with foreign central banks to alleviate funding pressures growing out of Europe’s fiscal crisis.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Last month’s spike in overnight funding markets led the Fed’s benchmark rate to trade outside of its range for one day.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">While the Fed quickly fixed the problem after it occurred, the funding-market dysfunction dinged the Fed’s reputation among some interest-rate traders and raised questions over the central bank’s strategy for its balance sheet.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The episode also followed a period in which New York Fed President John Williams dismissed the head of the bank’s markets desk, which oversees the balance sheet.</span> He has yet to name a successor.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The Fed’s balance sheet has swelled to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4 trillion</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $3.8 trillion</span> over the past month because the New York Fed has been conducting temporary overnight and short-term lending operations to restore liquidity to markets for very-short-term loans that banks make to each other overnight, called repurchase or “repo” agreements.

70818,"<h3>Bernie Sanders To Host A Climate Town Hall, Amplifying Progressive Calls To Cut Emissions</h3>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will host a livestreamed town hall summit on climate change next month, a move that may intensify pressure on the next Congress to curb planet-warming emissions and challenge TV networks to cover a rapidly worsening crisis they’ve long ignored.

The 90-minute event ― scheduled <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7 p</span>.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Dec.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 </span>― will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center Auditorium in Washington and broadcast over Facebook, YouTube and Twitter by seven progressive media outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“We need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet,” Sanders told HuffPost by phone.</span> “The good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back.”

Speakers <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">include 350.org</span> founder Bill McKibben, activist and “Big Little Lies” star Shailene Woodley, climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel, activist and musician Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, and Mayor Dale Ross of deep-red Georgetown, Texas, whose avowedly pragmatic embrace of newly cheap renewable energy has made him a poster boy for how Republicans could quit climate change denialism.

It’s the fifth live-broadcast town hall Sanders has hosted. Past programs examined the universal health care proposal Medicare for All, inequality, the Iran nuclear deal, and workers vs. chief executives.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The event bolsters Sanders, a likely contender for <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 Democratic</span> presidential nomination, as the most serious candidate on climate change, offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions.

</span>The summit, which took months to plan, will take place less than a month after Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) propelled talk of a so-called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream, giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October, the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 12 years</span> or risk catastrophic warming <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $54 trillion</span> in damage.

The historic wildfire that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 63 dead</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 631 missing</span> in Northern California this month, in what was once the Golden State’s rainy season, offers a glimpse of that future, Sanders warned.

Search and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned by the Camp Fire in Northern California.

“What we are seeing is a growing consciousness,” Sanders said. “The horrors that we’ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced ― this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long, hard struggle to transform our energy system.”

Climate remains a low priority for most voters. <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Just 38 percent</span> of registered voters said candidates’ positions on global warming would be “very important” to their voting decisions, according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 28 issues</span> voters ranked in the questionnaire.

But among liberal Democrats in that poll, the issue ranked fourth, behind health care, gun policies and general environmental protections. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">A YouGov survey <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018 voters</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 75 percent</span> of Democrats strongly supported charging companies with big carbon dioxide footprints a polluter fee, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 56 percent</span> favored giving unemployed Americans federally backed jobs in energy efficiency and weatherization.

</span>In the lead up to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 midterm</span></span> elections, the fossil fuel industry <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $100 million</span> to crush pro-climate ballot measures across the West, and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so-called eco-socialists. And a new majority of Democratic state attorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages.

Activists, freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of California’s deadliest wildfire, seem primed for action, and the party’s progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue that’s remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade.

“The fact that [climate change] is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable, because that was not the case even five years ago,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist and Yale’s climate program director. “If you think of Bernie, you’d think he’d be talking about inequality or civil rights. There’s a whole host of progressive issues, yet this is the one he’s leading with. It may suggest there’s been an alignment of the stars.”

Last week, youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit-ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal.

At least three sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus agreed to back a resolution Ocasio-Cortez proposed to establish a 15-member Green New Deal panel. Activists are hoping Sanders’ event will add <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 presidential</span> contender’s star power to their movement.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The horrors that we’ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced ― this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system.”

- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

“He helped popularize things like Medicare for All, a living wage and a lot of other fights he’s taken up,” said Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of Sunrise Movement.</span> “I hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire that’s been lit under politicians and the public over the past week.”

Sanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2017,</span> he co-sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100-percent clean energy <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2050.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The bill <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included $7 billion</span> in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil-fuel communities, and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs.</span> In <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017,</span> Sanders introduced a bill to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $146 billion</span> rebuilding storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy.

“What we need is extremely bold legislation,” Sanders said. “If there are Democrats who cannot support it, well, we’ve got to push pressure on them.”

The relative absence of climate science from TV broadcasts that dominate American political discourse makes it hard to raise awareness of the near-term threats warming poses.

Seventy-one percent of major, televised debates in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 midterm</span></span> elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 107 segments</span> ABC, CBS and NBC aired from Nov.<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 to</span> Nov.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 on</span> the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News aired a <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 260 minutes</span> of climate coverage,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 79 percent</span> of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trump’s personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.

“This is an issue of huge consequence and you would think that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox would be talking about this every day, having the debate, ‘What do we do? Where do we go?’” Sanders said. “Clearly you aren’t seeing that debate.”

Sanders’ inequality town hall in March <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drew 1.7 million</span> viewers. Similar numbers might show cable news producers that climate change is not, as MSNBC host Chris Hayes revealingly described it in July, a “ratings killer.”

“These are a big deal,” Sanders said. “We hope this can be part of the revolution that we need in thinking on climate change.”"

15840,"<h3>How Liz Truss became the shortest-serving prime minister in U.K. history</h3>LONDON — She campaigned for prime minister as the ideological incarnation of the 1980s Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, as a strong plain-speaking woman in pearls, who would finally unleash Britain’s true post-Brexit potential by slashing taxes for investors and corporations, and getting the workers to work a bit harder.
The once triumphalist Liz Truss resigned on Thursday in humiliation, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 days</span> in office, becoming not a modern Conservative icon but the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Truss was brought down by what is widely perceived as her incompetence, her failure to sell her vision — not just to lawmakers from her Conservative Party and the slim numbers of Tories out in the hinterlands, but to the broader electorate and to currency and bond traders in London.
</span>Her ouster also reflects an ongoing identity crisis among Conservatives — fragmentation that led to the agonizing experience of Brexit and leaves open the question of not only who will lead the country, but in what direction.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Britain is adrift about its place in the world and its relationship to Europe, about how to address soaring inflation and an anticipated recession, and about what to do about issues ranging from immigration to climate change.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Truss scrambled to reverse herself and her supply-side, trickle-down plan for growth, quickly jettisoning top ministers and gutting her signature policy, with its tax cuts for high-earners, investors and corporations, funded in the short term by more borrowing and debt.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The U-turn helped calm bond traders, momentarily, and boosted the British currency.</span> But it wasn’t enough to save her politically.
“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,” she said in front of the prime minister’s residence at Downing Street on Thursday. “I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the king to notify him that I am resigning.”
Conservative power brokers are bitterly divided on who should next lead their party and become the third British prime minister in eight weeks.
The Conservative Party plans to pick a new leader by Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 28,</span> after voting by the party’s lawmakers in Parliament and an online vote involving the dues-paying party members — less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 0.3 percent</span> of the British population. Graham Brady, the chair of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1922 committee</span></span>, the Conservative Party’s parliamentary group, announced a sweeping change to the rules, truncating what is usually a two-month process.
Any Conservative lawmaker can put their name forward, provided they have the backing of at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 100 of</span> their party colleagues in Parliament — a fairly high bar.
Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the Exchequer who has twice tried to become prime minister, quickly ruled himself out.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Names bandied about as possible contenders include former finance minister Rishi Sunak, Truss’s main rival in the last leadership race, who warned that her economic policies would end in disaster — a “fantasy land” he called it.
</span>There’s also Penny Mordaunt, the current leader of the House of Commons, who came in third in the last contest and is popular with the Conservative Party faithful — though in snap polling of the broader public most respondents could not name her when shown a photo.
Another option: The return of Boris Johnson. Rumors are building that he could mount a push for the rare role of once-and-future prime minister.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">His allies told the British papers that he felt it was in the “national interest” for him to stage a return.
</span>A lot of voters might not want Johnson or his party to give it another try. The Conservatives have been in power <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 years</span> and millions of bad headlines. If there were a general election now, they would almost certainly be annihilated. The opposition Labour Party is <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 30 points</span> in opinion polls.
Labour leader Keir Starmer, who hasn’t had to do much more than sit back and watch his rivals implode, called for a general election “now.”
“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” Starmer said in a statement following Truss’s announcement. “They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish.”
But because the Tories led by Johnson won a general election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> they don’t have to submit to another vote <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2024.</span> A motion to call for an early election would need at least two-thirds of the votes in Parliament. That would only be possible if the Conservatives support the measure, which they would be loath to do while they are down so far in the polls.
Truss herself should have been safe from another leadership challenge for at least a year. But Conservatives are known for ruthlessly casting aside their leaders. Out went David Cameron for opposing Brexit. Out went Theresa May for failing to get Brexit done. Out went Johnson for a pileup of scandals and for misleading members of his own party, who declared him unfit to govern.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Truss was thrown under the bus for gross mismanagement of the economy, but also because it was quickly clear she wasn’t helping her party regain the trust of voters.</span> YouGov said she was the most unpopular prime minister the organization had ever tracked.
On Thursday, a day after she told Parliament that she was a “fighter, not a quitter,” Truss met with the powerful chair of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1922 committee</span></span>, who would have known exactly how many Conservative members of Parliament had issued secret letters of no confidence in her leadership.

Among the discontented was Conservative lawmaker Gary Streeter, who tweeted, “Sadly, it seems we must change leader BUT even if the angel Gabriel now takes over, the Parliamentary Party has to urgently rediscover discipline, mutual respect and teamwork if we are to (i) govern the UK well and (ii) avoid slaughter at the next election.”
In one impassioned interview Wednesday night, lawmaker Charles Walker spoke frankly about his frustrations. “I’m livid,” he said. “I really shouldn’t say this, but I hope all those people who put Liz Truss in No.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10,</span> I hope it was worth it … because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.”

News of Truss’s resignation stole the show at the opening of a European Union summit in Brussels, as leaders entering the meetings were asked to weigh in on Britain’s political crisis. There were glimpses of schadenfreude and some sly smiles from leaders who sat on the other side of Brexit negotiations. But leaders mostly kept it classy, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying he hoped Britain “regains political stability very quickly.”

The Campaign
FEAR AND CORONAVIRUS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020</span> race</span> has finally winnowed. But coronavirus now threatens to put a damper on campaign season.
It's on — for now: President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all said that they will continue to hold campaign rallies despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassing 500— and the cancellation of other large-scale events and gatherings across the country amid concerns about its spread.
- But Sanders suggested the situation is fluid: “We will not endanger the health of anybody in this country,” Sanders said on CNN's “State of the Union.” “ … We are watching this thing very, very carefully. What is most important is the health of the American people.”
- Sanders said that “in the best of all possible worlds” the three candidates might want to scale back travel and their exposure to large crowds. “But right now, we're running as hard as we can.”
- Biden told reporters in Jackson, Miss., on Sunday — while rubbing Purell sanitizer on his hands — that his campaign is “listening to the experts at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and doing everything they recommend.”
- The AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of unions, was the latest organization to cancel its presidential forum scheduled for this week in Orlando, Florida. Biden and Sanders were both slated to attend.
The comments show the dueling pressures on the trail: Sanders and Biden promise to run aggressive campaigns as they consolidate support in what's now a two-man race for the Democratic nomination — but don't want to downplay the recommendations of public health officials warning millions of Americans that large crowds could increase their risk of getting infected.
And while Trump, for his part, has brushed off concerns about coronavirus and insisted as recently as Saturday that “we'll have tremendous rallies,” our colleagues our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and Juliet Eilperin report that “changes to Trump’s travel schedule are also being contemplated, after public health officials warned that elderly Americans should reconsider flying on airplanes and avoid large crowds.”
- “Trump,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 73,</span> had no campaign rallies scheduled as of Sunday evening, marking the first time this year that there were no such events on the books,” they note.
- The next round of delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday when six states will vote: Idaho, Mississippi, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.
But public health officials have escalated warnings: “If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,” the nation's top expert on infectious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on NBC News's “Meet the Press.” “So it's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable. When I say 'protect,' I mean right now. Not wait until things get worse. Say no large crowds, no long trips. And above all, don't get on a cruise ship.”
- Worth noting: Trump, like his fellow septuagenarian candidates Sanders and Biden, are “at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19,” according to guidance from the Centers For Disease Control (CDC).
- It's up to individuals to decide what's best for them: “This will be a recommendation,” Fauci added.
- But their decisions now are critical: “We have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic,” former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on CBS News's “Face the Nation.” “What you want to do is … put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted.”
Potential close calls at political events: The confirmed coronavirus cases at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Conservative Political Action Conference, both large gatherings of prominent politicians, activists and voters, have raised concerns about the virus's spread.
There's growing concern in the White House about Trump's own exposure: “Trump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during [CPAC] last month,” Toluse, Josh and Juliet report. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus that he has sought to minimize as it has rocked financial markets and tested his leadership skills.”
- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) decided to quarantine himself after being informed that he interacted with the CPAC attendee diagnosed with the virus: “I'm not experiencing any symptoms and I feel fine and healthy,” he wrote in a statement.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, Until <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 14 days</span> have passed since the CPAC interaction.”
</span>- Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) also announced that he is under self-quarantine after being in contact with the individual for “an extended period of time.” “I am closing my office in Washington, D.C. for the week and my team will follow the previously approved Tele-commute plan,” he said.
- There's broader “anxiety in an aging Congress,” NBC's Kasie Hunt and Alex Moe report: “Members of Congress are becoming increasingly anxious about coronavirus, and there is growing pressure on leadership to take steps to protect lawmakers — even potentially recessing for a period of weeks — two Democratic congressional sources said Sunday.”
THE WEEK AHEAD IN TRAVEL: But Trump's travel continues for now. The Republican Jewish Coalition is holding its annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas later this week where the president is currently a featured speaker. There are so far four confirmed cases of coronavirus in Nevada.
- “We will announce rallies when we are ready to do so,” Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, told our colleagues Felicia Sonmez, Juliet Eilperin and Paige Winfield Cunningham. “And we have loads of campaign events on the event schedule on the website,” she added.
- Sanders has an event scheduled today in Detroit with health officials to discuss the coronavirus.
- Biden will also host an event in Detroit with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who just endorsed the former veep.
PAST THE POINT OF CONTAINMENT: It might be only a matter of time before the federal response shifts and candidates are forced to cancel. U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams, part of the administration's task force on coronavirus, said on CBS News's “Face the Nation” that the administration was past the point of “containment” and now “trying to help people understand how to mitigate the impact of disease spread.”
- “Well, containment worked to slow the introduction of the virus and gave people time to prepare, and now we know that communities need to look at how we deal with — with community spread and things such as social distancing, not having large gatherings, pulling down events,” Adams told Margaret Brennan. “Those are conversations that communities need to be having right now.”
- What is social distancing?: “I'm not asking everyone to stay at home and lock the door for a month,” Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen. “I'm saying, be thoughtful every time you contemplate getting together with a crowd or group.”
But Gottlieb suggested that more aggressive measures to mitigate the outbreak that Trump has been reticent to implement might be necessary. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said policymakers should give state and local governments economic support so they can take more aggressive steps to limit people's exposure.
- “I think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy.</span> But that’s what’s going to need to happen,” Gottlieb told Brennan of the idea of governors imposing mandatory quarantines in affected areas. “But that’s what’s going to need to happen. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">States and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic.”
-</span> And he urged the Trump administration to provide a “comprehensive plan”: “There is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step, make that leap, if you will.""

MEXICO'S DAY WITHOUT WOMEN: “Women poured into the streets on Sunday to start a two-day protest and national strike against gender-based violence, in what organizers hope will be a turning point for women's rights in a country disfigured by violence and machismo,” our colleague Mary Beth Sheridan reports from Mexico City.
- “The annual demonstration for women’s rights here has turned into something of a social uprising after a string of gruesome killings,” our colleague writes. “Women took to the streets around the country — from U.S. border cities such as Ciudad Juárez to communities in southern Guerrero state, where indigenous women and peasants joined marches.”
- This has become a major political challenge: President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been one of Latin America's most popular leaders, but “his approval ratings have slipped as he has responded in what many view as a ham-handed way to the wave of outrage over femicides.”
Protests marking international women's day took place around the world: “From the streets of Manila to the plazas of Santiago, Chile,” the Associated Press reports. “Tensions marred some celebrations, with police reportedly using tear gas to break up a demonstration by thousands of women in Turkey and security forces arresting demonstrators at a rally in Kyrgyzstan.”

93473,"<h3>Trump, Ryan say they are ‘totally committed’ to uniting their party</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan struck a conciliatory tone after meeting in Washington Thursday, seeking to ease tensions that flared last week when Ryan said he is not ready to endorse the business mogul in his bid for the White House.
</span>“While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,” Trump and Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a joint statement shortly after their meeting at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill. “We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there’s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal.”
Despite the positive tone of the statement, Ryan is still not committing to supporting Trump as the party’s nominee, although he said he was “encouraged” by their conversation Thursday.
“It’s no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill later in the morning. “The question is what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings of the party. It was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together.”
Ryan said the next step is to drill down on policy differences to find commonalities, adding that their “policy teams” were going to meet to “work through the details.”
“Going forward we’re going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds to make sure we have a better understanding of one another,” he said.
Ryan called unifying the party “a process” and said it would “take some time” before it comes together.
“I don’t want us to have a fake unification process here,” he said. “I want to make sure that we really and truly understand each other.”
Trump’s face-to-face with Ryan was the first of several high-profile sit downs with Republican leaders that come as the campaign seeks to unite the party — and its resources — ahead of a competitive general election. The speaker described the meeting with the former reality TV star, who he admitted he doesn’t know very well, as a “pleasant exchange.”
“He’s a very warm and genuine person…we really don’t know each other and we started to get to know each other,” Ryan said.
The summit between Ryan and Trump was cast as an opportunity to soothe tensions between Trump and the GOP establishment at a pivotal moment for a party sharply divided over the likely nominee’s unorthodox and controversial campaign.
The day of meetings began <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9 a</span>.m. when Trump met with Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, after which he met with the full House GOP leadership team.
Shortly <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 10 a</span>.m., Priebus tweeted out that the meeting was “great.”
“They had very good chemistry between the two of them,” he said later on CNN. “It was positive and it was give and take. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">If anyone was a fly on the wall, they would agree with what I’m saying.”
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that during their meeting with Trump, House leaders ran through a long list of policy issues, including the national debt, foreign affairs and issues of particular concern to the lawmakers in the room.</span> McCarthy, for example, brought up California’s water crisis.
Both McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said they thought there was plenty of room for agreement with Trump.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">McCarthy noted House Republicans are working on a series of policy proposals they can take to voters this fall and said they specifically discussed their work on tax reform — an issue Trump has highlighted.
</span>“I think when you talk about ideas, you talk about vision, that’s a perfect place for people to unite,” he said.
McCarthy said other topics raised, included veterans’ issues and “the overreach of agencies.”
Trump left the RNC shortly <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 11 a</span>.m., waving at reporters from the back seat of his black suburban as he headed to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his top associates.
In the roughly 75-minute meeting with Senate Republican leadership, Trump listened as the senators took their turns raising issues of concern that had come up in his raucous campaign.
According to more than a half-dozen participants, the meeting was cordial and lacked any of the tension from the previous huddle with Ryan’s team as none of those senators had expressed the same reservations as the House speaker.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) raised policy concerns and while she declined to specify which ones, Trump’s positions on taxes, trade and entitlement programs have so far all run counter to where a majority of Senate Republicans stand.
</span>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 in</span> GOP leadership, told reporters he raised “the issue of tone” in relation to how the candidate could better attract Latino voters. This has been a major concern for Republicans in Washington, who fear that Trump’s antagonistic statements – he labeled Mexicans who come across the border as “rapists” the day he launched his campaign a year ago – will drive Hispanic voters deeper into the Democratic column and make it impossible to win a national campaign.
“I’ll be glad to share with you my experience and observations, because obviously that’s an important part of the voters <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span>” Cornyn said he told Trump, noting that he won a majority of Latino voters in Texas during <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 re</span>-election contest.
Additionally, the Senate leaders talked brass tacks about their campaigns ahead and agreed that in some cases Republicans are going to run away from Trump and his proposals.
“He looked forward to being helpful where he could,” Cornyn said, noting that some states might be more amenable to Trump policies. “He also understands that some places, people may choose to run independently and not join up with the presidential.”
Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans seeking reelection this year, said “it was a good listening session – it really was, on both sides.”
Portman flatly rejected any speculation he would want to be Trump’s running mate.
“No,” was his quick response when asked by a reporter.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the most senior Senate Republican, was the most enthusiastic about the meeting.
“Yes, I totally endorse him,” Hatch said. “We want him to win and we want him to be the next president.”
He waved off reporters’ questions about whether Trump was on board with House and Senate Republicans’ agenda by pointing out that the discussion only lasted an hour.
“There were naturally questions raised that you might call criticism, but he handled them very well,” Hatch said.
“He’s a very, very bright guy,” he added. “He’s a very good guy.”
Trump’s trip to Washington became a spectacle in and of itself.
The streets outside Republican National Committee headquarters assumed a circus-like atmosphere Thursday morning with dozens of cameras staked out every entrance to the building, satellite trucks lined the nearby streets and passersby gawked at the spectacle.
[A fake Trump, a bagpiper and a guy with a ram’s horn meet on the sidewalk…]
At one point, a man wearing a portable megaphone and a papier mache Trump head walked down First Street SE carrying a brown paper sack with a dollar sign on it.
“The Donald has spoken, and the GOP is listening!” he shouted as photographers swarmed around him.
As he shook his bags of money and made campaign promises like giving all women free manicures and pedicures, Trump supporter Johnny Rice stood in front of him with a mega-horn and sang religious songs in an attempt to drown out the protester. He then switched to sounding a ram’s horn that he bought on eBay.
“Okay: Believe in spiritual or don’t believe in spiritual, God spoke to me and said that he was raising up Trump to trump the evil government of Obama,” said Rice,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48,</span> who lives in Maryland.
The impetus for Trumps trip was the war of words between the Ryan and Trump camps that occurred last week after the speaker declared that he was “just not ready” to support Trump as the party nominee. Trump responded in a statement that he was not ready “to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda.” The comments highlighted the rifts that Trump will need to overcome in coming weeks as he seeks to unify the party.
At one point there was a question over whether Ryan would step down from his role as chairman of the Republican National Convention due to his differences with Trump. On Thursday, he indicated they had put that issue behind them.
“I am happy to serve in this capacity at the Republican convention,” he told reporters. “I would honor the decision of our presumptive nominee and he did express that preference.”
Trump and Ryan sought to distance themselves from their hostile exchange ahead of their sit down Thursday. Trump said Wednesday night that the purpose of the meeting with Ryan is “unity,” striking a conciliatory tone after the public spat and adding that the two are looking to get to know each other.
But tensions within the party over Trump have only worsened in the week since he effectively clinched the nomination following the departures of rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, members of the Bush family and other top Republicans have declined to endorse Trump publicly. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Romney, who ran <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 with</span> Ryan as his running mate, blasted Trump on Wednesday for suggesting he would not release his tax returns until after the election.
</span>The real estate mogul will need party resources behind his White House run if he hopes to run a competitive bid against likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
The Trump campaign is finalizing plans with the RNC to set up a joint fundraising committee — a “victory fund” — to solicit donations far larger in magnitude than what the campaign itself is legally allowed to accept. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The additional funds are routed to the party’s war chest then used to finance national get-out-the-vote operations.
</span>[Trump fundraising operation ramping up with Los Angeles kick-off]
A chief worry among congressional Republicans is that Trump’s harsh rhetoric on immigration and his past disparaging comments about women will hurt GOP members in tight re-election battles this fall.
Sensing this blood in the water, congressional Democrats have eagerly attempted to portray Trump as the embodiment of what the Republican party has become.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blasted Republicans, and McConnell in particular, during a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.
“At some point in their conversation Donald Trump should thank the senior senator from Kentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and to the policies that he’s led,” Reid said. “It was an obstructionist, anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-middle class, anti-environment and anti-Obama and anti-everything Republican Party of the last eight years that made Donald Trump a reality.”
But this line of attack runs somewhat counter to the message from the campaign of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, which has sought to court center-right Republicans who remain uneasy about voting for Trump in the fall by pointing out how unpopular he is even within his own party.
“Since Donald Trump became the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee for president last Tuesday, the chorus of Republicans and conservative commentators from around the country rejecting his unpredictable, risky and divisive candidacy has grown daily,” the Clinton campaign blasted out in a statement as Trump met with Ryan.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2013,</span> Unilever has leaned heavily on volume to drive growth, a strategy investors typically like because it signals strong underlying demand.</span> In the third quarter, though, Unilever’s volumes <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">declined 0.4% from</span> a year earlier in a marked deceleration from <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.8% growth</span> it reported in the second quarter.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Economic fundamentals remain weak and volatile,” said Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly on a Thursday conference call, also citing currency devaluation in Latin America as having squeezed disposable income.</span> The industry’s third-quarter volumes fell <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 10% in</span> Brazil and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 7% in</span> Argentina.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“When currencies weaken, the cost of living goes up faster than incomes, and people either cut back on purchases or they down-trade,” Mr. Pitkethly said.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Unilever signaled it was pushing the cost of those currency swings to consumers—or at least to the middlemen, like grocers—that buy Unilever products, from Dove soap to Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.</span> Last week, Britain’s largest grocer, Tesco TSCDY -1.82 % PLC, temporarily pulled Unilever products off its online shopping site amid a pricing dispute. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Unilever said last week it was raising prices for all of its U.K. customers to offset the sharply falling pound after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.
</span>Apart from a downturn in Russia, Reckitt’s growth is also slowing in Europe. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Political turmoil in Turkey and challenges in Africa and the Middle East have hurt sales, as well.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Executives expect the bumpy sales environment to get tougher still through the rest of the year, as companies that were protected by hedges start to feel the full impact of higher commodity prices.</span> “You should expect things to remain, in aggregate, choppy,” Reckitt Benckiser Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor told investors.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, signaled on Tuesday that the central bank was growing more concerned about high — and stubborn — inflation, and could speed up its plan to withdraw financial support from the economy as it tries to ensure that rapid price gains do not become long-lasting.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell, whom President Biden plans to renominate for a second term, testified before the Senate Banking Committee at a fraught economic moment.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Inflation has jumped to its highest level in three decades and a new coronavirus variant, Omicron, threatens to keep the economy from returning to normal, potentially dragging out supply and demand mismatches.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Yet millions of workers are still missing from the job market — and the health threat could keep them on the sidelines.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">As arguably the nation’s most important economic policymaker</span>, Mr. Powell must navigate that divide. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">His comments Tuesday suggested that he was preparing to do it with an eye more firmly focused on the threat of inflation.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">That could mean ending the Fed’s bond-buying program sooner than expected.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The central bank had been <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buying $120 billion</span> in government-backed securities each month throughout much of the pandemic to bolster the economy by keeping money flowing in financial markets.</span> In November, officials announced plans to slow those purchases <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $15 billion</span> a month, which would have the program ending midway <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2022.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But Mr. Powell said the central bank could wrap up more quickly, reducing the amount of economic juice the Fed is adding.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“At this point, the economy is very strong, and inflationary pressures are high,” he said.</span> “It is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner.”
His comments further rattled investors, who had already been fretting about Omicron’s potential impact. Stocks, which had been down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 0.5 percent</span> for much of the morning, tumbled after Mr. Powell’s comments and the S&P closed <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 1.9 percent</span>. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Short-term bond yields, which are heavily influenced by expectations for Fed rate increases, spiked as investors began to expect what is sometimes referred to as a “hawkish,” or aggressive approach to interest rate policy.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">“The tone of his remarks was notably hawkish, suggesting that the Fed’s primary focus is on the risk of more persistent excess inflation,” Krishna Guha, an economist at Evercore ISI, wrote in a research note reacting to the testimony.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said he expected Fed officials to discuss slowing bond purchases faster “at our upcoming meeting,” which is scheduled for Dec. 14-15.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">He stressed that between now and then, policymakers will get a better sense of the new Omicron virus variant, a fresh labor market report and updated inflation numbers.
</span>While he emphasized that much is unknown about Omicron, he said experts could get a better sense of it “in about a month,” and will know at least something about the risks “within a week <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 10 days</span>.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">For now, he focused on the risk the central bank has already come to know: rapid price gains.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Inflation is running at its fastest pace since the early 1990s in the United States, and prices have picked up in Europe and across many other advanced economies as booming consumer demand runs into sharply constrained supply.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">In the eurozone, annual inflation jumped <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.9 percent</span>, according to data released Tuesday, the highest since records began <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span></span> Global factory shutdowns, clogged ports and unusual shipping patterns have driven shortages in couches, cars and computer chips.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Fed officials had for months predicted that the snarls would clear and price gains would fade.</span> Instead, they have broadened — and that has made central bankers like Mr. Powell increasingly worried.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">“Generally, the higher prices we’re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it’s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,” Mr. Powell said Tuesday.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">“I think the risk of higher inflation has increased.”
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Monetary policymakers had spent recent months focused on helping the economy to heal, hoping to pull the millions of workers still missing from the job market back into work.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">To that end, the Fed’s policy interest rate, its more traditional and more powerful tool, has remained set to near zero.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Officials had been stressing that they would be patient in pulling back that support and cooling down the economy, giving missing employees more time to return.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">But their tone appears to be shifting as prices for food, rent and goods are jumping.
</span>Slowing bond purchases quickly would put officials in a position to raise borrowing costs sooner than previously forecast. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Lifting interest rates earlier or faster would pump the economic brakes, helping to slow home-building, business expansions and consumer spending.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Weakening demand would in turn help to weigh down prices over time.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">By trying to rein in price increases, the Fed would probably slow hiring.</span> Doing so could be painful while people still remain out of work partly out of virus fears or a lack of child care.
That’s why Omicron could pose such a big challenge. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">If the new variant shuts down factories and slows shipping routes while keeping would-be job applicants at home, it could put the Fed in a tough spot.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Central bank policymakers are supposed to foster both full employment and keep prices stable, and such a situation would force them to choose between those goals.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s willingness to pull back support faster despite the new variant — and his full-throated recognition that price gains are not poised to be as short-lived as officials had once hoped — caught investors’ attention.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Understand the Supply Chain Crisis
Covid’s impact on the supply chain continues.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain and made all kinds of products harder to find.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">In turn, scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher as inflation remains stubbornly high.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">“The Fed is the ultimate owner of the ‘transitory’ characterization, and the chair’s decision to move beyond that is a decidedly hawkish step,” wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, in a note to clients shortly after Mr. Powell’s comments.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">At one point, Mr. Powell even said that at “coming meetings” he expected the Fed’s policy-setting committee would say that when it comes to inflation, its standard for lifting interest rates had been met.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">That would mean that central bankers would simply be looking to the job market as they weighed when, whether and how much to raise borrowing costs.
</span>For Mr. Powell, the timing is complicated. <span id=""37"" class=""red"">The Biden administration announced last week that it would renominate him as chair of the Fed, and that it would elevate Lael Brainard — now a governor — as the central bank’s vice chair.</span> Both await Senate confirmation.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">Inflation is factoring into the political moment, as well, as Republicans try to pin high inflation on the Biden administration and its policies.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">Several Republican senators asked combative questions of Mr. Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen during their joint testimony on Tuesday, at times trying to back them into blaming rapidly rising prices on Mr. Biden’s policies.
Democrats, furthermore, are working to pass <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2.2 trillion</span> climate change and social policy bill before the end of the year.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen defended the Biden administration’s economic agenda, insisting that the policies were fiscally responsible and that they would reduce costs for families.
</span>“The Build Back Better plan contains support for households to help address some of the most burdensome and most rapidly rising costs that they face,” Ms. Yellen said, pointing to proposals to make preschool free, provide expanded care for the elderly and increase education subsidies.
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">Republicans, who four years ago <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">passed $1.5 trillion</span> in tax cuts that went mostly to the rich, assailed the spending proposals as reckless.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen insisted that tax increases and an investment in the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that people and companies are paying the taxes they owe would prevent the legislation from adding to the debt.
</span>“It is fully paid for, or even more than fully paid for,” Ms. Yellen said.
<span id=""43"" class=""red"">Others criticized the administration and Fed’s response to the virus and the risk that it posed, saying policymakers needed to accept that the disease would be around for a long time and should not react every time a new strain appeared.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“At what point do we just get back to a more normal execution of Fed policy?”</span> Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, asked Mr. Powell.
“We have to be humble about our ability to predict this, or really understand,” Mr. Powell replied, after saying that the central bank did not expect the new variant to have fallout that is “remotely comparable” to the initial pandemic-spurred state and local lockdowns.

Rising Rents Are Fueling Inflation, Posing Trouble for the Fed
Economic policymakers have said inflation will prove temporary, but rising rents may challenge that view and pressure Washington to react.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Terrell McCallum, a private wealth adviser in Dallas, spends a lot of time thinking about markets and interest rates.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He knows that the Federal Reserve <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">targets 2 percent</span> annual price increases on average, so it was a shock when he learned that his rent would increase a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whopping 10 percent</span> this year.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“I can afford it, but it gets to the brink of financial burden,” said Mr. McCallum,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 33.</span></span> He and his wife have been saving up for their first home, but now that they are <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying $1,830 for</span> their apartment and fees, that will become more difficult. He tried to push back on the increase, but the company he rents from wouldn’t budge.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“They said: ‘This is what the market is doing.’”
Mr. McCallum’s experience is echoing across America, as rents shoot higher after a brief pandemic slump, burdening households and fueling overall inflation.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That is bad news for the Federal Reserve, because it could make today’s uncomfortably rapid price gains last longer.</span> It’s also problematic for the White House because it hits households right in their pocketbooks, diminishing well-being and fueling unhappiness among voters.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The jump in rents stemmed from a frenzy in the market for owned homes.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">People tried to buy as the pandemic took hold in the United States, often searching for extra space, but found that houses were in short supply after years of under-building following the housing crisis.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">That dearth of properties has been exacerbated by work stoppages, supply shortages and labor constraints during the coronavirus era, all of which have kept developers from ramping up production to meet demand.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">As buyers bid up prices on single-family homes and condominiums, many people who would have otherwise moved toward homeownership found themselves unable to afford it, increasing demand for apartments and home leases.</span> Rents have been further boosted by the large number of people searching for places with more space and home offices during the pandemic, and as millennials in their late 20s and early to mid-30s look for more autonomy.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“People might be looking to move out and on their own after being stuck with roommates during the pandemic,” said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, an online freelancing marketplace.</span> “There’s also a possibility that remote work is playing a role here.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Government stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits also helped people amass savings over the course of the pandemic, so they can afford to move.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Personal savings as a share of disposable income popped during the crisis, and while the share has come down toward normal levels, it remains slightly elevated <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.4 percent</span>, compared with <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 8 percent</span> just before the pandemic.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The combination of factors seems to have created a perfect storm that pushed the Consumer Price Index measure of rent <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.5 percent</span> just between August and September, the fastest pace in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 years</span>.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">That’s a concern for the Fed, because housing prices tend to move slowly and once they go up, they tend to stay up for a while.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Rent data also feed into what is called “owners’ equivalent rent” — which tries to put a price on how much owners would pay for housing if they hadn’t bought a home.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Together, housing measures make up about a third of the overall Consumer Price Index.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Overall consumer prices have jumped sharply <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbing 5.4 percent</span> in September from the prior year.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Fed officials have been hoping and betting that the move is temporary, but they are watching housing measures carefully as a risk to that outlook.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“Many participants pointed out that the owners’ equivalent rent component of price indexes should be monitored carefully, as rising home prices could lead to upward pressure on rents,” minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, released Wednesday, said.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Rent is less critical to the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the one it officially targets when it shoots <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2 percent</span> annual inflation on average, than it is to the C.P.I.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">But it is a big part of people’s experience with prices, so it could help shape their expectations about future cost increases.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Those expectations matter a lot to the Fed.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">If consumers come to anticipate faster inflation, they may begin to demand higher wages to cover their rising expenses.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">As businesses lift prices to cover rising costs, they could set off an upward spiral.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Already, some key measures of inflation outlooks — notably the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations — have jumped higher.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Fed is already preparing to start slowing the large bond purchases it has been making during the pandemic to keep longer-term interest rates low and money flowing around the economy.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">If inflation stays high, the Fed may also come under pressure to raise its policy interest rate, its more traditional and more powerful tool.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">That might slow mortgage lending, cool the housing market and weigh down inflation.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">But doing that would come at a big cost, slowing the labor market when there <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 5 million</span> fewer jobs than before the pandemic.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">So for now, Fed officials are getting themselves into a position where they can be nimble without signaling that they’re poised to raise rates.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">White House officials are also wrestling with their options for easing housing price pressures.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">President Biden’s economic agenda includes measures that would build more houses and discourage zoning rules that keep new construction at bay.
</span>Such an intervention would take time — homes are not built overnight. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">And in the meantime, rents will almost certainly continue moving in the inflation data, which reflect rising housing costs at a long delay.</span> More up-to-date measures of rental pricing pressure produced by Apartment List and Zillow have shown costs climbing in recent months, though many measures of rent and new leases have calmed down somewhat after a red-hot summer.
The national median rent has <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 16.4 percent</span> since January, Apartment List said in its September rental report, with monthly growth slowing slightly from its July peak.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">U.S. Inflation & Supply Chain Problems
Covid’s impact on supply continues.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Price increases that grew out of pandemic-related shutdowns and supply chain disruptions have continued.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Here are some of its effects:
“This is still very strong by historical standards — we’re in off season,” said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List.</span> “It’s a racecar slowing down ahead of a turn, but it’s still going faster than we ever have in our lives.”
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Whether rent growth speeds up or slows next year may hinge on whether the government support that has given households the financial ability to afford housing gives way to a strong job market.
</span>“There’s room to run, for sure,” based on demographics alone, Mr. Ozimek said. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">“The question is whether the economy is going to go into full employment, or whether there’s a slowdown.”
Rents could heat up as big cities including New York and Los Angeles rebound from the pandemic, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of Redfin.</span> While smaller cities’ rental markets have been hot for months, the median rent in Manhattan climbed for the first time since the start of the pandemic in September, data from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman showed.
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">The recovery in the New York area as a whole has been uneven as some families have moved to the city, bidding up prices, while others are struggling to pay, said Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents landlords of mostly rent-stabilized housing.
</span>“You have bidding wars for one unit, and then a renter who can’t pay,” he said. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">“A tale of two cities is happening within the same building.”
Drew Hamrick, the senior vice president of the Colorado Apartment Association, a landlord group, said the rise in rents is not driven by landlords but by market factors.
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">“Landlords don’t really set the price, consumers set the price,” he said.</span> “It’s musical chairs.”
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">Even if there is a pullback in rents next year, today’s suddenly higher housing costs could make for a painful adjustment period.</span> Higher rent costs can reverberate through people’s lives and force tough decisions.
Luke Martinez, a 27-year-old in Greenville, a town in East Texas, is contemplating buying a trailer and setting his family up on an R.V. lot after learning that he is losing the three-bedroom house he has been renting for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,000 per</span> month <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span>
“It’s insane the amount of rent, even in this little podunk town,” Mr. Martinez said.
He’s looking at paying up <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,500 per</span> month for a new place, which will be tough.

<span id=""43"" class=""red"">If they end up renting at the higher price, they will most likely afford it by forgoing a new car.

57002,"<h3>Live Updates: Democrats Embrace Manchin’s Voting Rights Proposal</h3>Live Updates: Democrats Embrace Manchin’s Voting Rights Proposal
A plan put forward by Senator Joe Manchin III is narrower than the sweeping voting rights bill Democrats have been working on for months, but the senator has been the party’s lone holdout on the issue. Infrastructure talks remain in flux.
Democrats and progressive activists who have been working for months on a sweeping voting rights bill quickly embraced on Thursday a new, far narrower plan suddenly put forward by Senator Joe Manchin III, their party’s sole holdout on the issue.
Their decision to do so did nothing to improve the chances that the legislation could get through the Senate, but it reflected another significant goal for Democrats: uniting the party around what it has billed as its highest priority and showing that, were it not for Republican opposition and the filibuster, the elections overhaul would become law.
Much to the growing consternation of Senate Republicans, the alternative ideas put forward by Mr. Manchin — a centrist from West Virginia and the only Democrat who has refused to support what is known as S.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 </span>— quickly gained traction with progressive Democrats and activists, most notably Stacey Abrams, the voting rights champion in Georgia.
On Thursday, she praised his plan, even though it is more limited in scope than the original Democratic measure. The proposal would make Election Day a holiday, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">require 15 days</span> of early voting and ban partisan gerrymandering, among other steps.
“What Senator Manchin is putting forward are some basic building blocks that we need to ensure that democracy is accessible, no matter your geography,” Ms. Abrams, a former candidate for Georgia governor, said on CNN.
Given her national standing on the issue, her endorsement was a huge boost for Mr. Manchin’s approach — though it only hardened Republican opposition to a measure they have made clear that they intend to block at all costs.
But as far as Senate Democrats are concerned, it is Mr. Manchin whose support is most important. The reason is the magic number <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50.</span>
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, has hesitated to bring top Democratic priorities to the floor this year without the backing of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 senators</span></span>. Given the Senate’s even partisan split, it takes every Democrat and Democratic-leaning independent, plus the tiebreaking power of Vice President Kamala Harris, to guarantee a majority. Then, if Republicans mount a filibuster, Democrats can point out that they had the votes to approve legislation, bolstering their argument that the Senate rules are being abused by Republicans and unfairly impeding highly popular policy changes.
With a test vote on the measure looming next week, Mr. Manchin’s opposition to the voting rights measure threatened to be a major embarrassment for Democrats.
So if Mr. Manchin could be brought on board, Democrats appeared more than ready to agree. As Mr. Schumer took procedural steps to set up a vote on the elections bill as early as Tuesday, a spokesman was quick to note that the measure being put on the floor could “act as the vehicle for the voting rights legislation being discussed with Senator Manchin.”
With Mr. Manchin’s support, Democrats could then claim at least a symbolic victory, if not a legislative one, when Republicans block the bill through a filibuster.
PHOENIX — The political fortunes of Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, have risen unlike any other Democrat in the country in the tumultuous aftermath of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> election. Now running for governor, she has emerged as a high-profile defender of the state’s election results and critic of Republican attempts to overturn the outcome.
Her path stands in stark contrast to that of another prominent Arizona Democrat: Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a professed maverick who seems to relish thumbing her nose at liberals and has angered many Democrats in recent weeks.
Insisting on bipartisanship, Ms. Sinema has become, along with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a key intraparty roadblock to President Biden’s agenda. This week, all eyes in Washington have been on Ms. Sinema and other moderate senators as they pursue a bipartisan infrastructure bill. But by refusing to eliminate the filibuster, she and other Democratic senators have left in doubt the passage of sweeping voting rights legislation that many on the left view as an existential necessity in the face of a nationwide Republican crackdown.
Ms. Hobbs, by contrast, has gained newfound fame in her party for facing down withering attacks from Republicans — including death threats against her and her family that prompted round-the-clock security from state troopers — and for denouncing a widely criticized G.O.P. audit of votes in the state’s largest county as a sham and a threat to democracy. Now she is the most popular statewide elected official, according to some polls, and is starting a bid for governor with more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 million</span> in her campaign’s coffers.
Ms. Hobbs’s position is unique in part because so many other elected officials defending results in contested states like Georgia and Michigan were Republican — but in Arizona, the secretary of state was an ambitious Democrat enthusiastic about making headlines.
“If things had gone differently with the election, or the amount of exposure that I got after the election, I don’t feel like I would be in such a strong position,” Ms. Hobbs said in an interview in a Phoenix coffee shop. “I certainly don’t think that things would be going as well as they are so far.”

With the United States unlikely to reach President Biden’s self-imposed deadline of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">having 70 percent</span> of American adults partly vaccinated against the coronavirus by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4,</span> he trumpeted a different milestone:<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 300 million</span> shots in his <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 150 days</span> in office.
Mr. Biden spoke about the vaccination drive from the White House as his administration makes a last push to reach the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4 goal</span></span>. Vice President Kamala Harris and the health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra were both on the road Friday, trying to drum up enthusiasm about the vaccine. Ms. Harris was in Atlanta and Mr. Becerra was headed to Colorado.
“It’s an important milestone,” the president said, touting his administration’s work. “It just didn’t happen on its own or by chance.”
Mr. Biden took office warning of a “dark winter” ahead, as deaths were near peak levels and vaccinations were barely underway, and he is clearly trying to portray the virus as in retreat as he nears six months in office. A fact sheet distributed by the White House in advance of Friday’s remarks noted <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 15 states</span> and Washington, D.C., have gotten at <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 70 percent</span> of adults one shot
“The results are clear: America is starting to look like America again, and entering a summer of joy and freedom,” the document proclaimed.
When Mr. Biden set the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4 goal</span></span> in early May, he said meeting it would demonstrate that the United States had taken “a serious step toward a return to normal,” and for many people that already seems to be the case. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">This week, California and New York lifted virtually all of their pandemic restrictions on business and social distancing.
</span>But the time frame is tight. An analysis by The New York Times shows that, if the rate of adult vaccinations continues on the seven-day average, the country will fall just short of Mr. Biden’<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 70 percent</span> goal, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 67.5 percent</span> of American adults having had their first shot by <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4.</span>
As of Thursday,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 65 percent</span> of adults have had at least one shot, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the number of Americans getting their first shot has been dropping steadily, from <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 500,000 a</span> day to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200,000 a</span> day since Mr. Biden announced that June would be a “month of action” to reach his goal.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I don’t see an intervention that could really bring back an exponential increase in demand to get the kind of numbers that we probably need to get <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 70 percent</span></span>,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health officials.</span> “Every day it seems like it’s starting to trickle along. So I think realistically, probably the best thing we could do is to try to get to steady state at this lower level.”
Experts say that from a disease control perspective, the difference <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 67 percent</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 70 percent</span> is insignificant. But from a political perspective, it would be the first time Mr. Biden has set a pandemic-related goal that he has not met. Mr. Biden has continually set relatively modest targets for himself and exceeded them, including his pledge to <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 100 million</span> shots in the arms of Americans by his <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 100 days</span> in office.
“<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 70 percent</span></span> target is not a hard and fast number; not hitting it exactly does not mean the sky is falling,” said Jen Kates, director of global health & H.I.V. policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “On the other hand, it has symbolic importance. There has been a lot of emphasis on getting to that point and not hitting it is a reminder of how difficult the remaining stretch is going to be.”
In a speech at the White House on <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 4,</span> Mr. Biden said he was launching a new phase in the fight against the coronavirus, with a goal of at least partly <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vaccinating 70 percent</span> of adults by Independence Day. He made a personal plea to all of the unvaccinated: “This is your choice. It’s life and death.”
When asked about the <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4 deadline</span> on Thursday, Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, avoided saying specifically that the nation would reach <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 70 percent</span></span> threshold by that date.
“We’ve made tremendous progress,” Mr. Zients said. “Hundreds of thousands of people are continuing to get their first shots each day, and we’re going to get <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 70 percent</span></span>, and we’re going to continue across the summer months to push <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">beyond 70 percent</span>.”
Speaking to students at a Covid vaccination mobilization event at Clark Atlanta University in Georgia on Friday, Ms. Harris warned of the dangers of misinformation and framed the decision to get vaccinated as a way to take power back from the virus.
There are people who “may have heard things that aren’t quite true,” she said. “Let’s arm ourselves with the truth. When people say, it seems like this vaccine came about overnight, no it didn’t. It’s the result of many many years of research.”

The Roman Catholic bishops of the United States, flouting a warning from the Vatican, have overwhelmingly voted to draft a statement on the sacrament of the Eucharist, advancing a political push by conservative bishops to deny President Biden communion because of his support of abortion rights.
The decision, made public on Friday afternoon, is a rebuke of the nation’s second Catholic president, the most religiously observant commander in chief since Jimmy Carter, and exposes bitter divisions in American Catholicism. It capped three days of contentious debate at a virtual June meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The measure was approved by a vote <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 73 percent</span> in favor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 24 percent</span> opposed.
The Eucharist, also called holy communion, is one of the most sacred rituals in Christianity, and bishops have grown worried in recent years about declining Mass attendance and misunderstanding of importance of the sacrament to Catholic life.
But the move to target a president, who has regularly attended Mass throughout his life, is striking coming from leaders of the president’s own faith, particularly after many conservative Catholics turned a blind eye to the sexual improprieties of former President Donald J. Trump because they supported his political agenda. It reveals a uniquely American Catholicism increasingly at odds with Rome.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden, like Pope Francis, embodies an ascendant liberal Christianity focused less on sexual politics and more on racial inequality, climate change, and poverty.</span> His administration is a reversal of the power abortion opponents, including bishops who advanced the measure, enjoyed under Mr. Trump.
The text of the proposal itself has not been written, and would ultimately require approval by a two-thirds majority vote. The proposed outline, earlier reported by America Magazine, said it would “include the theological foundation for the Church’s discipline concerning the reception of Holy Communion and a special call for those Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith.”
But the fact that Mr. Biden’s views on abortion are even a matter of public discussion is already a victory for conservative Catholics.
The fight comes as anti-abortion activists across the U.S. are emboldened and as reproductive rights activists want Mr. Biden to speak more forcefully in their defense. State legislatures have introduced more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 abortion</span> restrictions over the past five months, and the Supreme Court, with its newly expanded conservative majority, agreed to take up a case on a Mississippi law that bans most abortions <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 15 weeks</span>, which could challenge the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. Five of the court’s six Catholic justices were appointed by Republicans.
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, an assembly of the country’<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 433 active</span> and retired bishops, can issues guideline statements, but it does not have the authority to decide who can or cannot receive the sacrament of communion. That power is reserved for the local bishop, who has autonomy in his diocese, or the Pope.
Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, has made it abundantly clear that he does not support denying communion to Mr. Biden. Bishop-elect William Koenig of Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden’s hometown, has remained largely quiet on the issue ahead of his installation next month.
As Congress and the Department of Defense debate how to address the ongoing scourge of sexual assault and harassment in the military, a study on the Army released Friday found that age, experience and where soldiers are based strongly correlate to both offenses.
Women at Fort Hood in particular — where an Army specialist was killed by another soldier last year — have a far higher risk of sexual assault at that base in Texas than the average woman in the Army according to the new study, conducted by the RAND Arroyo Center, a federally funded research group.
Using gender and workplace data, researchers found that the total sexual assault risk to Army women at Fort Hood <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">during 2018 was</span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8.4 percent</span>, compared with <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5.8 percent</span> risk for all women in the Army.
The researchers also found that for both men and women, younger age was associated with increased risk for sexual assault, as were low education levels and junior rank. Fort Hood and Fort Bliss — another installation in Texas with above-average rates of assault — have large numbers of junior ranking, young soldiers. Further, for both men and women, longer deployments on antiterrorism missions also led to higher risk for sexual assault and harassment.
The new findings suggest that “there are location-specific concerns that require targeted interventions into climate and culture and will require additional research to understand,” Dr. Jenna Newman, Dr. Jenna Newman, a social science adviser and the Army’s project lead for the study, said in a news release.
Sexual harassment is more common than sexual assault in the Army, the authors found, but the risk of sexual harassment is highly correlated with the risk of sexual assault, something other research has also suggested.
A bill sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would remove military commanders from a role in prosecuting service members for sexual assault, which she and her supporters in the Senate argue would lead to increased prosecutions and deterrence. At the same time, a panel appointed by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III made a similar recommendation and was expected to release its final findings in the coming weeks.

After the Supreme Court ruled this week to uphold the Affordable Care Act, Republicans met the decision with a surprising message: Get over it.
“I think three times the Supreme Court’s upheld the Affordable Care Act, and I think we need to move on,” said Senator John Cornyn, a Republican whose home state, Texas, led the lawsuit.
For six election cycles, Republicans and Democrats have wielded the health care law as a political cudgel, battering their opponents over an issue that consistently topped the list of concerns for American voters. But now, after more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 70 efforts</span> to repeal or modify the law in Congress, three Supreme Court rulings and nearly a dozen years, Republicans may have finally run out of firepower.
The closest Republicans came to dismantling major parts of the law was <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017,</span> when legislation passed the House but crashed in the Senate after Senator John McCain flashed a famous thumb-down during the vote on the floor.
That failure to overturn the law after Republicans had gained control of Washington altered the political dynamics of the issue, reflecting growing support for the health care law that had become deeply embedded in American life.
As of this month, a <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 31 million</span> people receive insurance through its plans. Last year, the law became more popular than ever, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 55 percent</span> of people expressing a positive view of it — the highest rating since the Kaiser Family Foundation began tracking opinions of the act <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> More <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 70 percent</span> of Americans <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 67 percent</span> of Republicans believe it is important that popular provisions protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions remain in place.
“Hopefully, this will be the end of the line,” said Brad Woodhouse, the executive director of the liberal group Protect Our Care and one of many Democrats who took a victory lap after the Supreme Court’s ruling. “If Republicans continue to do this, they are likely to continue to lose elections on this issue.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">During <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 campaign</span>, President Biden pledged to transform the Department of Housing and Urban Development into a frontline weapon in the fight against racial and economic inequality.
</span>But when his transition team took over last fall, it found a department in crisis.
The agency’s community planning and development division, the unit responsible for a wide array of federal disaster relief and homelessness programs, had been so weakened by an exodus of career officials that it was faltering under the responsibility of managing tens of billions of dollars in pandemic aid, according to members of the team.
And it was not just the planning unit. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In some divisions, as many <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 25 to</span><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span> of jobs were unfilled or occupied by interim employees.</span> The losses were concentrated among the ranks of managers and policy experts, many of whom had been overruled, sidelined, exiled and eventually driven away under President Donald J. Trump and his appointees.
<span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 10 percent</span> of the agency’s work force left during Mr. Trump’s first years in office, according to agency estimates. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But that came on top of a decade-long decline resulting from attrition, poor recruitment and budget deals cut by the Obama administration with a Republican-led Congress at the time that prevented the agency from replacing departing employees.
</span>As a result, the agency’s total head count fell <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span>, <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6,837 from</span><span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,576,</span> <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2012 to</span><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span>
Other cabinet departments, like the Education Department and Environmental Protection Agency, face similar problems. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But the staffing shortfall at the housing department is a case study in the personnel issues generated in part by Mr. Trump’s conflicts with experienced career government employees who carry out programs and policies.</span> And it is especially worrisome to Biden administration officials because it threatens to undermine their hope of transforming the agency into a central player in the president’s efforts to put more focus on social justice issues.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I’m not going to sugarcoat it,” Marcia L. Fudge, Mr. Biden’s new housing secretary, told a Senate committee last week during budget hearings.</span> “Until we can start to build up our staff, and build up our capacity, we are at risk of not doing the things we should do.”
Democrats weigh a plan as large <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $6 trillion</span></span></span> as a bipartisan group pursues a narrower infrastructure deal.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Senate Democrats have begun privately weighing a sprawling economic package as much <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $6 trillion</span></span></span> — <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $3 trillion</span> that is paid for — even as a bipartisan group of senators works to draw support for a much narrower infrastructure plan that would <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">devote $579 billion</span> in new money to fund physical public works projects.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The details of both plans remain in flux, as lawmakers work to maneuver some, if not all, of President Biden’s economic agenda around the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate and razor-thin margins in the House.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For now, the divergent efforts are proceeding in parallel, with Republicans and Democrats pushing forward on their compromise proposal and Democrats preparing to use the fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to avoid a filibuster of their far larger plan and push it through over Republican opposition.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">At a meeting on Wednesday convened by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, Democrats on the Budget Committee discussed taking unilateral action on a package as large <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $6 trillion</span></span></span>, with half of it paid for, should the bipartisan talks fail to produce a deal, according to four people familiar with the discussion.</span> The details of the emerging discussions were reported earlier by Politico.
The Democrats also discussed potentially including measures to expand Medicare, including lowering the eligibility age <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 60 and</span> expanding benefits for all beneficiaries to cover dental, hearing and vision care, according to three of the people, who disclosed details on condition of anonymity because they are still in flux.
Democrats also discussed incorporating revisions to immigration law in the package, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, told reporters on Wednesday, calling it a “big-picture” discussion given that the strict budgetary rules governing the reconciliation process could force lawmakers to modify or jettison priorities in the package.
But Democrats acknowledged that a final package might be smaller and narrower than the ambitious proposals discussed on Wednesday, given that <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 50 senators</span></span> who caucus with the Democrats and nearly every House Democrat will have to support the measure for it to become law.
“If you’re doing a package like this and try to <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 50 out</span></span> <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50,</span> there’s two ways to <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 50 out</span></span> of 50: take out things that people don’t like, or add in things that they like so much that they’re willing to support things that they don’t love,” Mr. Kaine said.

Hopes fade for an imminent federal deal on college athlete rules as state laws are poised to take effect.
Congress is not expected to move this month to override a crush of state laws that, as soon as <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 1,</span> will challenge the N.C.A.A. rules that have kept college athletes from making money off their fame.
The absence of an accord, or even a clear timeline for one, by the start of July would be a blow to the N.C.A.A. and its most influential and wealthy conferences, which have spent many months and millions of dollars seeking intervention from Washington. Although an agreement could still emerge this year, the prospects for a federal measure to advance before the state laws have gone from a long shot toward essentially nonexistent.
<span id=""12"" class=""red""><span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2019,</span> a law to let college athletes hire agents, cut endorsement deals and monetize their social media platforms cleared the California Legislature and the governor’s desk with ease.</span> That measure is not currently scheduled to take effect <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023.</span>
But Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas have laws that are scheduled to take effect on <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 1.</span>
Any coast-to-coast baseline standard that might be in effect early next month, though, will almost certainly have to come from the N.C.A.A. itself. With more state laws scheduled to come into force in the months ahead, public officials and college sports executives alike believe that changes or waivers to N.C.A.A. rules would amount to a stopgap.
On Capitol Hill on Thursday, when the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation met for the second time in eight days to hear testimony about college sports, the divide between congressional negotiators was clear with a glance at the dais: Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the panel’s ranking Republican, was absent. On Wednesday, Wicker announced a survey of college athletes “to solicit their views on what they would like to see” in a federal measure. Responses are due on <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 25,</span> around the time senators are expected to leave Washington for a recess that is tentatively scheduled to last until <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 12.</span>
Asked in an interview outside the Senate chamber on Thursday afternoon whether he saw a path to a deal by the end of this month, Wicker replied, “It would be a surprise to me at this point.”
Missouri has become the latest state to throw down a broad challenge to the enforcement of federal firearms laws, as Republican-controlled state legislatures intensify their fierce political counterattack against President Biden’s gun control proposals.
A bill signed by Gov. Mike Parson over the weekend — at a gun store called Frontier Justice — threatens a penalty <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $50,000 against</span> any local police agency that enforces certain federal gun laws and regulations that constitute “infringements” of Second Amendment gun rights.
At least eight other states — Arkansas, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Idaho and Texas — have taken similar action this year, passing laws of varying strength that discourage or prohibit the enforcement of federal gun statutes by state and local agents and officers.
The new law “is about protecting law-abiding Missourians against government overreach and unconstitutional federal mandates,” Mr. Parson and the attorney general, Eric Schmitt, said in a letter defending the law on Thursday to the U.S. Justice Department. They said the state would “reject any attempt by the federal government to circumvent the fundamental right Missourians have to keep and bear arms to protect themselves and their property.”
In interviews, the sponsors of the bill in the Missouri House and Senate acknowledged that the law would most likely have little immediate effect on the current operations of local and state police agencies, since there is presently little difference between state and federal gun laws in Missouri.
The Republican lawmakers said their main intent was to guard against the potential of more wide-ranging legislation from Washington, where Democratic lawmakers have proposed a major expansion of federal background checks, an extension of the time period in which federal officials can review purchases and bills to restrict the sale of popular semiautomatic weapons like AR-15s.
A growing number of Republican-sponsored gun bills are making their way through state legislatures, all with the purpose of easing restrictions and oversight in anticipation of Mr. Biden’s next moves.
Among the most significant are new laws in Tennessee, Iowa and Texas that now allow most adults to carry firearms without a permit.

When Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose coronavirus vaccine was authorized for emergency use in the United States in late February, it was seen as a breakthrough for reaching vulnerable and isolated Americans, a crucial alternative to vaccines that require two shots weeks apart and fussier storage. It was soon popular on college campuses, in door-to-door campaigns and with harder-to-reach communities that often struggle with access to health care.
But with <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 11.8 million</span> doses administered in the United States so far — less <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4 percent</span> of the total — the “one and done” vaccine has fallen flat.
States have warned that they may not find recipients for millions of doses that will soon expire, partly because the vaccine’s appeal dropped after it was linked to a rare but serious blood-clotting disorder and injections were paused <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 days</span> in April.
The vaccine took another hit last week, when regulators told Johnson & Johnson that it should throw out tens of millions of additional doses produced at a plant in Baltimore because they might be contaminated.
Although millions of Americans have yet to be inoculated, the vaccine’s role in the United States is fading fast. Experts lament a missed opportunity to address health disparities with a shot that should have been ideal for reaching vulnerable populations.

The Federal Reserve is expected to continue its fight against the fastest inflation <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span> by raising interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That would be the Fed’s sixth interest rate increase this year and the fourth time in a row they’ve bumped rates up by this much.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Fed officials have suggested that at some point it will be appropriate to dial back their increases to allow the full economic effect of these moves to play out.</span> The question is when that slowdown might happen.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Officials don’t want investors to conclude that the Fed is easing up on its inflation fight, because market conditions could become more friendly to lending and economic growth as a result, the opposite of what central bankers are aiming for.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">It’s a challenge that could be on full display when the Fed announces its rate decision <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2 p</span>.m. Eastern.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, holds his news conference at 2:30 p.m.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Here’s what else to know:
Stocks and U.S. government bonds were muted in early trading, as investors prepared to read the Fed’s signals about its next steps.
</span>Higher rates have a direct effect on Americans’ lives. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Savers may earn more interest and borrowers can expect to pay more on mortgages, credit cards and other forms of debt.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many top executives in Corporate America have said that they expect to see sustained demand for their goods and services, and that they expect to continue raising prices in the coming months.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That may make it harder for the Fed to stamp out inflation.
</span>Mr. Powell is well liked across the political spectrum. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But that could change as complaints about higher interest rates are likely to be lobbed at him personally.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Here’s one spot of good news for the Fed:</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The global supply chain crunch of the last few years has gone a long way toward resolving itself.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Some products and materials continue to be in short supply, but shipping prices have fallen back to where they were before the pandemic, and a massive bottleneck of container ships waiting outside the Port of Los Angeles has dissipated.
</span>Shipping is just one of the costs that businesses face, of course, but this should help translate into less pricing pressure on businesses that could ultimately benefit consumers in the months to come.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">It’s also worth noting that A.P. Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said in its latest earnings report today that “it is clear that freight rates have peaked and started to normalize during the quarter, driven by both decreasing demand and easing of supply chain congestion.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">As the Fed prepares to raise interest rates again, a backlash is growing among prominent Democrats in Congress, potentially setting the stage for a concerted pressure campaign from liberals to shift monetary policy ahead of <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 presidential</span> election.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The overarching concern: that the Fed’s actions are risking throwing millions of Americans out of work by dramatically slowing the economy.
Senators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have called on Mr. Powell to pause rate increases.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">This week, a coalition of progressives led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts warned Fed Chair Powell that “we are deeply concerned that your interest rate hikes risk slowing the economy to a crawl while failing to slow rising prices that continue to harm families.”
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">As the Federal Reserve battles the fastest inflation in four decades, the latest financial results from big companies may give them reasons to worry, The New York Times’s Isabella Simonetti and Jeanna Smialek report.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Many top executives have said that they expect to see sustained demand for their goods and services, and that they plan to continue to raise prices in the coming months.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">If companies continue to charge more and find that consumers are still willing to pay, it will make inflation harder to stamp out.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">That could mean more financial turmoil in the future.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Here are some themes from recent earnings reports:
Higher prices are not denting consumer demand.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">McDonald’s reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter and said it expected to raise <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">prices 10 percent</span> this year.</span> Hotels, airlines and related businesses have also benefited as consumers shift their spending away from goods and toward experiences.
Some firms are raising profits simply because they can. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Chipotle Mexican Grill saw “minimal resistance” to price increases of more <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Incomes matter when it comes to inflation.</span> Many consumers have more savings than they did before the pandemic, but those who live paycheck to paycheck are buying less or turning to cheaper brands.
The tech giants point to an impending slowdown. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Alphabet reported a decline in earnings, Microsoft had its slowest growth in five years, and Intel announced a cost-cutting program and lowered its profit forecast for the year.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Everyone’s wondering how higher interest rates are playing out in the economy, and we often look to the stock market for clues.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">But <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $24 trillion</span> U.S. government bond market is probably a better indicator of how interest rates are affecting the economy, and can provide predictions for the path for interest rates in the future.</span> Here’s our explainer about how this works.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">The Fed in September projected that it would raise rates by <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 1.25 percentage</span> points this year, suggesting a three-quarter point move at this meeting and a half-point in December.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, could explain during his news conference today why that step-down might still be appropriate, economists think — but many expect that he will avoid explicitly committing to a smaller move next month.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">The Fed wants to slow the pace of interest rate increases at some point soon because it wants to avoid overdoing its fight against inflation.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">While officials are determined to wrestle price increases lower, they are hoping to do that without absolutely tanking the economy — and they have already done a lot of tightening.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">They would like to see how that plays out as its full effects trickle through the economy.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">The Fed last met on Sept.<span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span></span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Since then, we’ve had a solid jobs report, decent consumer demand numbers and a strong Employment Cost Index report that showed wages and benefits still climbing rapidly.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Job openings initially seemed like they were plunging, but a report released yesterday showed a bounce-back.
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">Altogether, the economy is looking remarkably resilient, making it harder to wrestle down rapid price increases.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">We saw a fresh acceleration in both the annual Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures indexes for September, after stripping out food and fuel costs.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">As the Federal Reserve has lifted its key interest rate several times this year, Americans have seen the effects on both sides of the household ledger:</span> Savers benefit from higher yields, but borrowers pay more.
<span id=""41"" class=""red"">Here’s how it works:
Credit Cards
Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise, usually within one or two billing cycles.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">The average credit card rate <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 18.7 percent</span> as of Oct.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> according to Bankrate.com, up from <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 16 percent</span> in March, when the Fed began its series of rate increases.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">“With the frequency of Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, it will be a drumbeat of higher rates for cardholders every couple of statement cycles,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
Car Loans
Car loans are also expected to climb, but those increases continue to be overshadowed by the rising cost of buying a vehicle and the price you pay for filling it with gas.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Car loans tend to track the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate — but that’s not the only factor that determines how much you’ll pay.
</span>A borrower’s credit history, the type of vehicle, loan term and down payment are all baked into that rate calculation. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">The average interest rate on new-car loans <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 5.7 percent</span> in the third quarter, according to Edmunds, up <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5 percent</span> in the same period last year.
</span>Student Loans
Whether the rate increase will affect your student loan payments depends on the type of loan you have.
The rate for current federal student loan borrowers — many of whom will see up <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $20,000 in</span> loans canceled under a Department of Education program, which also extended a pause on payments until at least January — aren’t affected because those loans carry a fixed rate set by the government.
<span id=""46"" class=""red"">But new batches of federal loans are priced each July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May.</span> Rates on those loans have already jumped: Borrowers with federal undergraduate loans disbursed after <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 1 </span>(and before <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 1,</span> 2023) will <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay 4.99 percent</span>, up <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.73 percent</span> for loans disbursed the year-earlier period.
Borrowers of private student loans should also expect to pay more: Both fixed- and variable-rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate. Those increases usually show up within a month.
<span id=""47"" class=""red"">Mortgages
Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark rate, but instead generally track the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations around inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react to all of it.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates rose <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 7 percent</span> last week for the first time <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2002,</span> according to Freddie Mac, jumping more <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3.5 percentage</span> points since the start <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022.</span></span> The average rate for an identical loan <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3.14 percent</span> the same week <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021.</span>
<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Other home loans are more closely tethered to the Fed’s move.</span> <span id=""50"" class=""red"">Home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages — which each carry variable interest rates — generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed’s rates.
</span>Savings Vehicles
Savers seeking a better return on their money will have an easier time — yields have been rising, though they’re still pretty meager.
<span id=""51"" class=""red"">An increase in the Fed’s key rate often means banks will pay more interest on their deposits, though it doesn’t always happen right away.</span> They tend to raise their rates when they want to bring more money in — many banks already had plenty of deposits, but that may be changing at some institutions.
<span id=""52"" class=""red"">Rates on certificates of deposit, which tend to track similarly dated Treasury securities, have been ticking higher.</span> The average one-year C.D. at online banks <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3.2 percent</span> at the start of September, up <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 0.5 percent</span> at the beginning of the year, according to DepositAccounts.com.
<span id=""53"" class=""red"">Stocks and U.S. government bonds were muted on Wednesday, as investors prepared for another bumper interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.

APOLLO 11'S MICHAEL COLLINS REFLECTS ON HISTORIC MOON LANDING: 'WE WERE JUST REGULAR ASTRONAUTS'
""Mission control was talking to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">me 24 hours</span> a day,"" Collins recalled in an interview with Fox News last month, before adding that <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 20 was</span> an even busier day. ""The last task we had coming back from the Moon was reentering the atmosphere at a distance <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 250,000 miles</span>. The corridor we had to hit <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 40 miles</span> high, a tiny, tiny target. When we splattered into the ocean, we had to go through a whole other sequence. So [on both days], we were busy, busy, busy.""
But for <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 400,000</span>-strong men and women who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to achieve those first lunar footsteps, this was years in the making.
Nearly seven years prior, on Sept.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1962,</span> President John F. Kennedy gave his famous speech to a large crowd at Rice Stadium in which he decreed: ""We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.""
As a result, people from all walks of life (engineers, scientists, pilots, secretaries and more) and various parts of the country participated in making the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 voyage</span> a rousing success. However, it was chaotic up until the last few seconds of the journey, especially for those inside Mission Control on that fateful day.
""The tension in Mission Control was higher than in the spacecraft,"" said Charlie Duke, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 16 astronaut</span> and the capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11.</span></span> ""We had communication problems and we had a computer problem that really got everyone's attention. Fortunately, the problem was diagnosed and we continued down.""
""The tension in Mission Control was higher than in the spacecraft. We had communication problems and we had a computer problem that really got everyone's attention. Fortunately, the problem was diagnosed and we continued down.""
Duke added that as the craft got <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 400 to</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 500 feet</span> of the surface of the Moon, Armstrong said he could not land in the original area and wound up flying the ship horizontally, causing extra fuel to be used.
<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT</span> MICHAEL COLLINS REVEALS UNSEEN PHOTO OF MOON LANDING CREW HE 'FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOX'
""There was definite tension in Mission Control,"" Duke, who was the 10th person to walk on the Moon, told Fox News. ""I called to be on the ground <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 30 seconds</span>. <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">And 13 seconds</span> later, Buzz said 'contact' and the engines stopped. We knew they were close because they were kicking up dust.""
Gerald Griffin, the Apollo flight director, said he was able to watch the launch because his team's shift had ended.
""The tension was felt by everyone in that room,"" Griffin said, adding that there were <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 people</span> in the room at the time.
As tension rose and the nation watched on as NASA prepared to launch <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11,</span></span></span> many credit Gene Kranz, who served as NASA's second chief flight director, for helping keep the focus on the mission and the proverbial prize.
""A minute or two before the engine lit, Gene came on the loop that everyone had to listen to in Mission Control,"" Homer Ahr, an IBM programmer who worked on the Apollo missions, recently told Fox News. ""In his demanding, commanding and very monotone voice, [Kranz] said, 'We have just locked the doors and we are locked in this room together. We will leave this room together when one of three things happen — we land, abort or crash.' After he said that, if you didn't know this was important before, you knew it then.""
Ahr said NASA had given them <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 15 off</span> after they had been ""training nonstop for months, <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">working 16 to</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 hours</span> a day,"" in an effort to let them decompress and ""come in fresh on the 16th.<span id=""1"" class=""red"">""
""Our job was to arrive <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5 a</span>.m.,"" Ahr said.</span> ""We brought up the machines and checked out the software to do a dry run of the launch without involving the flight controllers. Later, we brought up the prime computer we used and before you knew it, it was liftoff. I typed in one of the first things that we entered into the computer, the time of liftoff 8:[32 a.m. EST]. I made a whole bunch of commands after that, but it was really sort of weird.<span id=""2"" class=""red"">""
Ahr continued: ""We had a job to do and we did it, learning to work under enormous pressure in a complex situation.</span> It was tense and it was a great feeling <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 12 minutes</span></span> when the third stage of the Saturn V shut off.

You just hoped you didn't screw up or crap your pants.""
The tension inside Mission Control was so thick it could be cut with a knife, and for those covering the event, the anxiety and stress were just as palpable.
Walter Cronkite may not have been inside the room that was jam-packed with white shirts, black ties and pocket protectors, but CBS' managing editor of news was almost as much a part of the launch as Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins were.
""When they landed <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 17 seconds</span> of fuel left, we were all listening to Mission Control,"" former CBS correspondent David Schoumacher, who reported live during the Moon landing, said in a recent interview. ""No one was saying anything in the studio or control room. We were all sweating it out just like the astronauts.""
""There was no script for when Neil said, 'The Eagle has landed.' The director was looking <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 30 monitors</span> looking at pictures that would work and saw Walter rubbing his hands with that goofy gesture,"" Schoumacher added. ""He [Walter] wanted to pray and he knew he shouldn't and he couldn't think of anything to say. That's perfect.

Steve Bales, who was Apollo 11's guidance officer, one of its most critical roles, noted that communications were ""dropping in and out"" and for <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2 minutes</span> on the 20th, they lost communication completely.
""The data comes back and I'm sitting there with one of my displays and comparing things like altitude and velocity and there's a problem,"" Bales told Fox News.

We weren't sure why this was happening and it didn't change for <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 minutes</span>. But at <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 minutes</span> into the descent, the landing radar locked onto the surface and I was relieved.""
But the issues were not over — not by a long shot.
""<span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 10 seconds</span> later, we got <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1202 alarm</span>,"" Bales added.

I immediately said, 'Flight we're going to alarm.' Neil, who never says anything during the critical phase, says 'Houston, give me a reading <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 1202.</span>' And Charlie Duke, who may have saved the mission, doesn't wait and tells the crew to go on the alarm. It was telling us the computer had too much to do, sending hundreds of signals at a time and that's why we got <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1202 alarm</span>.""
From there, all seemed quiet, with Bales thinking that the mission was ""home free"" on the 20th as the Eagle lander got down to <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 7,000 feet</span>. <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">But 8 minutes</span> into a process that took <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 12.5 minutes</span>, NASA got another alarm.
""We're so close now that there's a chance they might not be able to land manually,"" Bales said. ""Bob Carlton, who <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 10 years</span> older than me, said there was no fuel gauge on the vehicle, only a sensor that was getting low.

Thirty seconds and then a few seconds later, we heard touchdown and then tranquility base. And that's when we had to get ready.""

No one could fault anyone NASA for celebrating the monumental achievement with a sip of alcohol or two, but that was not the case — at least not until later.
""We had what we called a state of the state a few minutes after they landed to make sure they were OK on the surface,"" Griffin said. ""We didn't celebrate at touchdown, there was too much left to do.""
But when the crew landed back on Earth, the room got pretty crazy — cigars were smoked, flags were waved,"" Griffin added, noting that they later went to a local bar and had a beer bust. ""It was a crazy time.""

It wasn't until later, in some cases a few minutes, and in others, much, much later, that the impact was felt.
""After our debriefing, I walked out to my car, stuck the keys into the ignition and I couldn't start the car,"" Ahr said. ""That's when it hit me when I realized what we had done. I just sat there for five minutes and kept saying, 'We landed on the Moon.'""
Amidst all the chaos inside Mission Control, Griffin said there was one thing that stood out about this unmatched triumph of the human spirit: pride.
""Not just for the whole country, but the whole world."""
77716,"<h3>Lionel Richie Has Some Bedding to Sell You</h3>Lionel Richie Has Some Bedding to Sell You
“I’m in the bedroom,” Mr. Richie said, referring to his many romantic songs. “At least use my sheets.”
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Supported by
On a recent, sticky August afternoon, Lionel Richie stepped onto the second-floor landing of the rotunda in J.C. Penney’s corporate headquarters in Plano, Tex., and surveyed its employees gathered above and below him.</span> Microphone in hand, he bellowed: “My people!”
Mr. Richie is a four-time Grammy winner, with <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 100 million</span> records sold, so he counts a lot of people as “his” people. Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers danced with him during his “Brick House” days with the Commodores, then swayed to his “Endless Love” serenades when he went solo. Younger fans may know him as a judge on “American Idol,” or as father to Nicole, Miles and Sofia.
Now, he has the undivided attention of a new fan: J.C. Penney, the struggling department store where Mr. Richie is introducing his new home goods collection.
That’s right. Lionel Richie, the 69-year-old multiplatinum singer-songwriter, is debuting a line of sheets and towels, which will be available in stores beginning Sept.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.</span> With his entourage and a camera crew in tow, he made a three-hour stop at the J.C. Penney campus, where he tried to excite the sellers of his black satin comforters and gold-embroidered pillowcases by, among other things, handing out two bouquets of roses and crashing a meeting of the board of directors.
The grand finale was the gathering in the rotunda. As the initial applause and cheers died down, Mr. Richie leaned on the wooden railing and shook his head, almost laughing.
“This is absolutely insanity,” he said.
Which is what you may be thinking, too. An explanation is forthcoming, but first the puns: Hello, is it zzzs you’re looking for? After a night of Dancing on the Ceiling, you can climb under this comforter and sleep All Night Long. Mr. Richie, once a Penny Lover is now a Penneys lover — and he’s coming for your linen closet.
“I’m in the bedroom,” Mr. Richie said, referring to his many romantic songs. “At least use my sheets.”
Celebrities sell stuff because it works.
To understand how we got to a place where we could collectively climb into bed with Lionel Richie, consider the threadbare, well-worn path of celebrity merchandising. Many stars have product lines; some simply license their names, while others are intimately involved in design.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Stores often demand the right to exclusively sell these product lines in order to ensure a lock on each celebrity’s fan base.
</span>Pop stars tend to gravitate toward creating their own clothing and accessories lines, where a few oft-cited individuals have had considerable success (see: Jessica Simpson and Victoria Beckham).
Home goods make sense for the Rachael Rays and Martha Stewarts of the world, but it is something of a new frontier for musicians, and a strategic one. The category attracts a broader customer base, with looser ties to age or a gender, and presents much less fashion risk. A set of sheets can sit on a store shelf for months. A strong-selling towel can stick around for years.
Facing declines in traffic, department stores like J.C. Penney are betting on star power to attract shoppers. Before hitting the sheets with Mr. Richie, J.C. Penney carried bedding collections from the actress Eva Longoria and the model Cindy Crawford. It also plans to sell bedding by Ayesha Curry, a foodie and the wife of the N.B.A. player Stephen Curry, this fall.
The store is especially excited about Mr. Richie’s line, which will be manufactured by Sobel Westex, the Las Vegas-based textile manufacturer behind Sleep Like a King, the bedding collection by Larry King and his wife, Shawn.
Executives see a strong correlation between the core J.C. Penney shopper — a woman over the age <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 45 </span>— and Mr. Richie. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His E-Score, a ranking of a celebrity’s marketability from E-Poll Market Research, is a near-<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perfect 98 out</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100.</span></span> Nine out <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 people</span> over the age <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 55 recognized</span> his name, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 97 percent</span> said they liked him.
Among the top attributes women assigned to him were “talented” and “good energy.” It’s not far off from Mr. Richie’s own sense of his brand, which he says is love. To guys, he is a musical wingman; to ladies, a swoony crooner.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">J.C. Penney could use some good energy after its most recent earnings report, which sent its stock plunging.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Katheryn Burchett, the chain’s senior vice president of merchandising for home, said Mr. Richie’s collection fills an aesthetic void in its assortment, pointing to the already strong online sales for the black-and-gold satin-like three-piece comforter set, on sale <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $149.99.</span>
</span>“We really want to reach out to his fans that may not have been in a J.C. Penney store for a while and get them to come in,” Ms. Burchett said.
Lionel Richie loves home goods. Don’t act so surprised.
If you’re still thinking, “Home goods? Really?” that’s O.K. Mr. Richie’s friends have said the same thing. “I’m actually enjoying this,” he said.
From an ornate sitting room in his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., Mr. Richie explained it further. “I was desperately trying to get the next hit record,” he said, when he reached a point of wanting something new, an additional outlet for his creative energy.
He had his team reach out to Walter Pelaez, the chief executive of Sobel, and they had dinner together at Mr. Richie’s house on Valentine’s Day <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> There, “the magic started,” Mr. Pelaez recalled. They spent all night long — just kidding, it was more like several hours — talking through the possibilities.
Celebrities are infusing the otherwise stale design landscape with a much-needed newness, Mr. Pelaez said, so he came to Mr. Richie’s house already intent on sealing the deal. For a musician to be thought of, his or her song has to be playing on the radio — a fleeting moment.
But sheets and towels are a permanent reminder, a particularly intimate connection. “It’s in your bedroom, it’s in your bathroom, it’s touching your body,” Mr. Pelaez said.
Mr. Richie said that interior design has been a hobby of his since he bought his home two decades ago. He performs <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 70 live</span> shows around the world each year and takes respite from the road by decorating his own space.
He collects sizable souvenirs from his travels, like the piece of the Berlin Wall in his backyard. Now, those same adventures inform his product design.
The J.C. Penney bed and bath line is the beginning of what Mr. Richie sees as a much bigger lifestyle brand, Lionel Richie Home, with more categories to come. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It’s his second attempt in home goods; <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 he</span> hosted a dinner party to introduce a higher-priced offering of glassware and china.
</span>That collection had limited distribution, according to a spokesman. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The concept will be reimagined at more affordable prices in the future.
</span>“I happen to stand every night in front of my customer. It’s called my fans,” Mr. Richie said. He appeals to people looking for quality and value. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their questions are practical: “How much is it going to cost?” and “Is it going to last after the third washing?”
His current line will be merchandised alongside color-coordinated pieces from J.C. Penney’s own label.</span> If a shopper buys a Lionel Richie Home six-piece white-and-black towel set, on sale <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $39.99,</span> she could pick up a few solid black towels from J.C. Penney’s line to coordinate. The intermingling of brands was intentional: It ensures both parties are invested in the success of the other.
The in-store setup that will be featured <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 250 locations</span> includes three photos of Mr. Richie: a head shot over each of the display beds and — the pièce de résistance — a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Richie standing between the two. The hope is that shoppers will see it as a selfie moment.
Mr. Richie certainly did. During his visit to J.C. Penney headquarters, he jumped on stage unprompted to pose for pictures with his cardboard self. Later, in the rotunda, Mr. Richie declared that he would change the way people think about selling. “The only way to do that is you have to do something slightly ridiculous,” he said.
It always helps to have a sense of humor.
Indeed, rather than run from the jokes, Mr. Richie joins them. The merchandise booth in Las Vegas, where Mr. Richie has a residency at Planet Hollywood until October, for example, sells mugs that read, “Hello, is it tea you’re looking for?”
It’s funny, and serves a purpose. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">At the J.C. Penney headquarters, when an employee inquired about his dinner plans, he said: “We’re going to sell a lot of sheets and pillowcases with that attitude right there, my dear.”
</span>“In life, there’s only one great bridge to the other side,” Mr. Richie said. “That is a sense of humor.” He sees it as a path toward relevance, and relevance as an alternative to retirement.
This fandom keeps him in the mix, Mr. Richie added, rattling off the admirers he often hears about: “My mama, my daddy, my cousin, my brother, my sister, my aunt loves you.” That fan base has to translate, he said. “Somebody is going to buy a towel and hopefully a sheet.”
“I would buy anything for Lionel Richie,” said Lisa Stewart, a 49-year-old mother of three from Lexington, Ky, who was attending Mr. Richie’s Las Vegas concert one Saturday evening. She had already shelled out hundreds of dollars for V.I.P. passes in celebration of her coming birthday.
Although she is a lifelong J.C. Penney shopper — her husband was wearing pants from the chain to the concert — Ms. Stewart had not heard of Mr. Richie’s bedding line. The possibility excited her. (Later, in an email, she said she saw pieces online and loved them all.)
On this particular summer night, Ms. Stewart was part of a crowd that drew people from San Diego and San Antonio, Illinois and Arkansas. For a little less than two hours, a few thousand people stood, if and when they were able, swaying and smiling.
Mr. Richie is a performer as much as he is a singer, cracking dad jokes in between his tried-and-true songs. “There’s a portion of your life when you realize that you got more years behind you than you do in front of you, so you’re not ashamed,” he said, taking a beat as the crowd laughed, “of telling your children, ‘Just get out of my face for a minute.’”
At another point, he pretended that a drink that was handed to him by a crew member was filled with something strong. (It was Pedialyte).
<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Around 10 p</span>.m., after “Easy (Like Sunday Morning),” “We are the World” and every other Lionel Richie song you maybe forgot he sang, the show was over. He walked offstage, shed his blue sequined “All Night Long” jacket and climbed into a black S.U.V., waiting to take him to his private plane.
Lionel Richie was going home to sleep in his own bed.

BIDEN 'ADAMANTLY OPPOSES' GOP BILL TO ABOLISH IRS, ELIMINATE INCOME TAX, SAYS BURDEN WILL FALL ON MIDDLE CLASS
</span>Those were the Democrat party platforms from JFK <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2008 when</span> President Obama won his first term.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">JFK’s tax cuts and smaller government.</span> Bill Clinton’s ""the era of Big Government is over,"" Al Gore’s ""reinventing and downsizing the government"" campaign. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">You can’t tax and spend your way to prosperity.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Unleash the private sector for job creation and growth.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Words like tax cuts, smaller government and growth in their platforms.
</span>So, were JFK, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama radical? Extreme? Tea Partiers?
But something happened <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2008.</span>
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">By President Obama’s second term, Democrats began to prioritize redistribution for income inequality at the expense of growth and ended up getting neither.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">This cannot be blamed on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.</span> There were massive bailouts and still lukewarm growth. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">From <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2009 and</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2016,</span> GDP grew an average of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.1 percent</span> annually, the lowest rate among expansion periods <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1949.</span>

</span>We are living in the age of the New Abnormal.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON BILL ABOLISHING IRS, ELIMINATING INCOME TAX
</span>This is the era of misbegotten media and Democrat attacks on any good faith effort to rein in blockbuster government spending.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">What’s alarming D.C. watchers is the fact that Congress has whooped through even more government debt spending with little oversight.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Since the pandemic, the U.S. Congress has approved debt spending that is the equivalent of the GDP of Germany, France and Italy combined.
</span>FDR’s New Deal spending is loose change under the sofa cushions compared to what’s happening now.
Do you see now how easy it was to slide into the era of the New Abnormal under former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer?
The two leaders did it by passing trillion-dollar spending packages at the 11th hour with no hearings, no debate.
Sources tell ""The Evening Edit,"" that Pelosi reportedly pushed her caucus into submission, with threats of withholding committee assignments, campaign funds, and appropriations for lawmakers’ districts.
And then there’s this: Democrats and the media also call the new GOP House Rules package to curtail government spending ""radical"" and ""extreme"" because it now has requirements like a 72-hour rule to read legislation before it is passed.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">GOP CHAIR STEFANIK PUSHES BILL TO REIN IN BIDEN POLICIES FUELING INFLATION ‘FIRE’
</span>Plus, House GOP has abolished Congress voting via proxy, where they could vote remotely without being present in the chamber. It was meant to stop COVID infections, but was still in place three years after the pandemic. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">At one <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">point 80% of</span> House Democrats voted via proxy, not showing up for their jobs, says the Brookings Institution.
</span>Do Democrats call that ""extreme""? And who can accurately review and fact-<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">check 4,000 pages</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 72 hours</span>?
No one. And no one did. That’s likely why this spending flew under the radar and included the ‘Monuments to Me,’ goodies. There’s the new ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi Federal Building"" in San Francisco, the new ""Nancy Pelosi Fellowship Program"" at the State Department."" <span id=""23"" class=""red"">There’s also the ""Senator Patrick Leahy Lake Champlain Basin Program"" in Vermont, and the ""Senator Richard Shelby FBI Training Center"" in Alabama.
Also crammed into the bill were personal drivers for government employees.</span> It turns out that dozens of government agencies got taxpayers to pay for their own limo drivers. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">""Personal drivers for hire"" (Ubers?) for even the Office of Government Ethics, the IRS commissioner, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, the FTC, the CFTC, the SBA, one and on, even for something called the National Cemetery Administration – perhaps where Congressional oversight is entombed and goes to die?

My family, like so many, wants to serve and help. We’re not special. We just connect with families who’ve lost loved ones. That’s all.
Like so many families, we’ve got loved ones who fought in virtually every war since the Civil War, for the Union Army.
My mother never knew her father, he died when she was just one year old from mustard gas attacks in WWI. Never knew her uncle, also a New York City (FDNY) firefighter who died from pneumonia a year later.

My great-grandfather who ran the New York City (FDNY) lost two sons in a year during the Great Depression (he was friends with the Roebling family who built the Brooklyn Bridge, we can only hope they were a comfort for him). Again, not special. Just know the pain.

Bill and Hillary Clinton helped raise more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 billion</span></span> from U.S. companies and industry donors during two decades on the national stage through campaigns, paid speeches and a network of organizations advancing their political and policy goals, The Wall Street Journal found.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Those deep ties potentially give Mrs. Clinton a financial advantage in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 presidential</span> election, if she runs, and could bring industry donors back to the Democratic Party for the first time since Mr. Clinton left the White House.
</span>Republicans, while capable of raising similar sums, worry the Clintons will take an early lead in the next presidential race, which is expected to total well above <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $2 billion</span> spent <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span>
""Clinton Inc. is going to be the most formidable fundraising operation for the Democrats in the history of the country. Period. Exclamation point,"" said Rick Hohlt, a lobbyist and fundraiser for Republican Party presidential candidates. ""It sure causes concern.""
The Journal tallied speaking fees and donations to Mr. Clinton'<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 1992 and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1996 presidential</span> campaigns; the Democratic National Committee during Mr. Clinton's eight years in the White House; Mrs. Clinton's bids for Senate and president; and the family's nonprofit entity—The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
The Journal was aided by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks election contributions. The center provided an industry breakdown of campaign donations.
Finding an exact total is difficult because the Clintons aren't required to make public any details about donations to their foundation. They voluntarily report donor names, however, and donation amounts within broad ranges.
In total, the Clintons raised <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $2 billion</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $3 billion</span> from all sources, including individual donors, corporate contributors and foreign governments, the Journal found. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between $1.3 billion</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $2 billion</span> came from industry sources.
By comparison, Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush raised a total <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.9 billion</span> for their four presidential bids, their presidential foundations, as well as for the Republican National Committee when they were in the White House. Another member of the Bush family—Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor—has said he would decide by year's end whether to enter <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span>. If he runs, he could challenge Mrs. Clinton's potential dominance of industry donors.
Mrs. Clinton's office didn't comment on the Journal's findings. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton declined to comment, neither confirming nor disputing the findings. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In past interviews, Mrs. Clinton's advisers have said she would neither favor business nor shy away from rooting out Wall Street abuses.
</span>The donated funds were split among the Clintons' political operations, which <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $1.2 billion</span>; their nonprofit foundation, which collected <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $750 million</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $1.7 billion</span>; and speaking fees, which totaled <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $100 million</span>.
Not counting <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250 million</span> the Clinton foundation has received from foreign donors, at <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 75% of</span> the money arrived in large donations from industry sources, a category defined by federal regulators and the Center for Responsive Politics. President Barack Obama, by contrast, raised less than half of his campaign funds from such donors. Industry sources gave two Bushes no more <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60% of</span> the money they raised for their political operations and presidential foundations, according to the Journal's analysis.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Financial services, including Wall Street, have been one of the single largest sources of money for the Clintons since <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1992 presidential</span> campaign.</span> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

It’s always been easy to prophesy Hong Kong’s doom. Ever since Britain handed over the bustling colonial entrepôt to Beijing <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> prognosticators and politicos of all stripes warned of its inexorable decline. Hong Kong’s liberal and quasi-democratic traditions, including civil liberties such as freedom of speech, would wane and wither under the new Communist overlords, they said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">So, too, would the economic preeminence of this famous port at the heart of global trade, eclipsed by booming cities on the Chinese mainland.</span> And, ultimately, Hong Kong’s supposedly apathetic local populace would accept its fate and get with the program.
None of these fears are misguided and, in some cases, have proved far too real. But for all the political pressure bearing down on Hong Kong, the city still has a way of defying the naysayers and standing up — even if that means rising against the tide of history itself.
That spirit has been on display this week. On Sunday, Hong Kong saw its biggest protests in half a decade, with possibly upward of a million people flooding the streets in opposition to a draft bill that would allow for extraditions to the mainland. A pocket of protesters who attempted to hold a sit-in at Hong Kong’s Legislative Council clashed with riot police and were blanketed with pepper spray.
The legislation’s proponents insist that current legal loopholes — Hong Kong does not have extradition treaties with China or Taiwan — need to be closed. But its critics argue that the bill fundamentally threatens the “one country, two systems” model that has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a degree of political autonomy <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1997.</span> Permitting extraditions to the mainland, they contend, would enable China’s authoritarian leadership to further erode the rule of law and civil liberties in Hong Kong. When a senior Communist Party official in the ruling Politburo publicly offered his support for the measure, it only deepened suspicions in Hong Kong.
“This is the last fight for Hong Kong,” Martin Lee, a pioneering democracy activist, told the Wall Street Journal. “The proposal is the most dangerous threat to our freedoms and way of life since the handover.”
Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing chief executive, Carrie Lam, did not heed the protests and is pressing ahead with the bill’s passage. By Tuesday night, groups of protesters were encamped near the Legislative Council, where elected lawmakers as well as officials handpicked by Beijing were set to debate the bill on Wednesday. The legislative body is widely viewed to be rigged in Beijing’s favor. And so there’s now talk of mass action, strikes, university boycotts and other forms of civil disobedience to force the region’s leadership to reconsider its current course of action.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Labor unions and small businesses across Asia’s financial capital planned more strikes,” reported Timothy McLaughlin for The Washington Post.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“In a sign of the rising stakes, more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,000 aviation</span> employees from various carriers, including the flagship Cathay Pacific Airways, signed a petition requesting to join the strikes.”
</span>On Wednesday, thousands of protesters flooded the streets of central Hong Kong near the Legislative Council building. Bowing to public pressure, Hong Kong’s lawmakers decided to postpone the debate of the bill.
Hanging over the current tensions is the legacy of the Umbrella Movement, the mass pro-democracy protest <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 that</span> occupied Hong Kong’s main commercial district <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 79 days</span>. Despite galvanizing a new generation of young activists, it achieved little in the way of political change. Instead, both China and the local government have clamped down on dissidents and the right to dissent in Hong Kong.
“For the past five years, residents of Hong Kong have fought with much difficulty against the erosion of our freedom,” activist Denise Ho wrote last week in a column for The Washington Post. “Pro-democracy lawmakers have been unjustly disqualified from office, booksellers have been kidnapped, and activists have been sentenced heavily for protesting. It’s obvious that our city’s system is no longer working in the people’s favor.”
In Chinese President Xi Jinping, Hong Kong faces an unmoved, unrelenting overlord. Experts suggest Xi, who has cemented his reputation as one of China’s most ruthless leaders, has little incentive to heed the protests of the Hong Kongers, let alone the complaints of Western governments on their behalf. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(In Washington, activists and lawmakers are calling on President Trump to retaliate economically if the measure gets passed.)
</span>“[Xi] will do whatever he can to enforce Beijing’s sovereignty and thumb his nose at Western efforts to interfere with Hong Kong or Taiwan,” Willy Lam, a Hong Kong-based political scientist, said to the Sydney Morning Herald. “He is a tough opponent of the Western order.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It doesn’t help Hong Kong’s cause that its economic clout has somewhat dipped in the decades since the handover, with business interests and executive talent drifting either toward greater opportunity within China or further away from the increasingly long hand of Beijing.</span> Out of fear for the future, large numbers of families are choosing to leave the city. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Earlier this year, the GDP of the Chinese megacity of Shenzhen — once a tiny fishing village in Hong Kong’s backwaters — surpassed that of the former British colony for the first time.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Though still Asia’s financial capital, Hong Kong looks tinier and tinier when set against China’s ever-rising colossus.
</span>But those among its more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 7 million</span> residents who believe in Hong Kong’s freedoms aren’t going down without a fight. The current standoff has revived the city’s civil society and pro-democracy movement. “Young people who had checked out from disappointment and frustration are reappearing, and once again actively participating,” Ho wrote.
“Judging by the crowds on Sunday, Hong Kongers’ scorn for the government on the mainland may have reached new heights,” wrote Yi-Zheng Lian, a Japan-based commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs. “This cannot be what Beijing wanted.”
On Tuesday, Sunny Leung,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> was distributing red fliers denouncing the extraditions bill. “Maybe we [Hong Kong] will die, but we will not die in silence,” he told The Post. “We are protesting until the end.”

88076,"<h3>The paradox of Colombia’s peace deal for FARC</h3>HAVANA — Over four years of peace talks with the Colombian government, the country’s FARC rebels bargained for the best deal possible — and one that could convince their troops that the past half-century of guerrilla warfare wasn’t for nothing. But in wresting significant concessions from the government, including a launchpad into politics and a chance to skirt prison, the rebels have run the risk of sweetening their deal so much that Colombians won’t stomach it.
This was perhaps the key masterstroke of President Juan Manuel Santos’s insistence that the peace deal be contingent on Colombian voter approval. He has set that vote, formally a “plebiscite,” for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Oct 2.</span> The entire deal is riding on the outcome.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Santos and his negotiating team have long warned Colombians that peace would have a price, as well as a heavy dose of what Colombians call “toad swallowing,” i.e. bitter medicine.</span> The government insists it has secured the best deal possible with the guerrillas, and with the accords now finalized there will be no chance of making revisions. If voters reject the agreement, the pact crumbles and the war will resume.
[Here are the details — critics would say the devils — in Colombia’s peace deal with FARC]
FARC commanders were no fans of this strategy. They wanted the deal to be ratified through a more limited consultation process — a special assembly — whose outcome would have been more predictable and easier to control. And like many of the peace deal’s supporters, they worry that Santos’s low approval ratings will hurt them at the ballot box.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Yet they have also feathered their beds with significant concessions from the government, guarantees that Santos opponents caricature as a giveaway to FARC “terrorists” who got rich on the drug trade and committed horrible atrocities.</span> Now the guerrillas are ducking punishment and getting a golden parachute into politics, opponents say.
Under the terms of the agreement, FARC will be afforded nonvoting representatives in Congress <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2018,</span> where they will be able to weigh in on matters related to the implementation of the accords. Then come the biggest toads: a minimum five seats for FARC in the 106-member Colombian Senate and five more in the 166-member lower chamber for two legislative terms through the creation of new voting districts. FARC, which has yet to reveal the name of its future political party and can’t form one until it fully disarms, will have to compete for seats on its own merits after that.
[The staggering toll of Colombia’s war with FARC rebels, in numbers]
Opposition senator Alfredo Rangel called these final concessions by the government “shameful.”
The rebels insist this pact is fair, given that so many leftists leaders, including FARC chief negotiator and former congressman Ivan Marquez, were forced out of democratic politics a generation ago by violence. Thousands of members and supporters of the Patriotic Union party, formed by FARC and other Colombian communists, were wiped out in the 1980s and '90s by paramilitary gunmen.
Still, it will not be hard for the peace deal’s detractors, led by powerful former president Álvaro Uribe, to depict the guarantee <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 unelected</span> legislative seats as an unconscionable freebie. Colombians who know FARC leaders from grainy “wanted” posters and jungle videos may have trouble accepting them as respectable lawmakers.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Another element that could trigger public resentment: Demobilized ex-combatants will receive a monthly government stipend nearly equal to Colombia's minimum wage for a two-year period after the accords.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">They will also be eligible for onetime cash payment of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $2,500 </span>-- a significant sum in Colombia -- to start a business.
</span>[The Colombian peace agreement has a big emphasis on the lives of women. Here’s how.]
Uribe and other opponents of the deal have also attacked it on the grounds that it offers “amnesty” to FARC commanders charged with murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking and other crimes. The accords will establish a parallel justice system akin to a truth-and-reconciliation process, wherein guerrillas and members of Colombian security forces and other combatants can serve time at halfway houses, work farms and other alternatives to prison.
In his speech Wednesday, Santos seemed hard-pressed to push back, insisting there would be “no immunity” for the worst offenders. “They will be investigated, judged and sanctioned with several years of restrictions on their freedom. They’ll have to tell the trust — the whole truth — and make reparations to their victims,” Santos said. “And if they don’t, they’ll go to jail for up <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 years</span>.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert, said the justice agreement and FARC’s return to politics are the two biggest points in the peace deal that will be “hugely unpopular in Colombia and carry a political cost for Santos.”</span> But he said FARC has arguably given up more in the negotiations, since it scratched much of its wish list items, including land reform, full amnesty and an end to forcible coca eradication.
“I think the FARC gave some ground when it became clear that too much intransigence would only empower the far right in Colombia,” said Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. “They were careful to bend the process, to get what they could, but not break it.”
On Oct.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 the</span> government and the rebels will find out whether they found the right balance, or if their accord will die on arrival."

24060,"<h3>Top Office Developers Hit the Pause Button on New Projects</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. real-estate developers are delaying major office projects already under way or in the planning stages, discouraged by high vacancy rates and the reduction in workspace demand resulting from remote work.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Some property developers view periods of economic uncertainty and weak office demand as good times to launch new projects.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Because large-scale developments tend to take three to five years or longer, developers bet that tenants looking to trade up in office quality will be drawn to modern offices with lots of amenities, just as the economy is gaining steam.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">But soaring interest rates and the slow pace at which workers are returning to offices have even some risk-taking developers wary about the future.</span> With office use only about half of what it was before the pandemic, some of the most active developers are postponing major projects and are losing their appetite for new developments.
‘There’s increasing uncertainty in the world, and tenants are acting accordingly.’— Vornado President Michael Franco
That list includes real estate heavyweights Vornado Realty Trust, Houston-based Hines, Kilroy Realty Corp. and Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc., according to the companies or people familiar with the matter.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Caution is the word of the day,” Vornado’s president and chief financial officer, Michael Franco, said on Vornado’s earnings call last week.</span> “There’s increasing uncertainty in the world, and tenants are acting accordingly.”
Some analysts took these and other comments by Chief Executive Steven Roth as a sign that Vornado might move slower than expected on its planned new office tower on the site of Manhattan’s Hotel Pennsylvania, which it is demolishing. Mr. Roth declined to address that matter on the call.
Kilroy, which earlier this year delayed <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 600,000</span>-square-foot development in San Diego, said last month that it was shelving <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 500,000</span>-square-foot project in Austin, Texas, that had already started.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“There are times to buy, times to sell, times to develop and times such as now to be patient,” John Kilroy, chief executive and chairman of Kilroy Realty, said on an earnings call.
<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 156 million</span> square feet of office space construction currently is under way in the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">largest 54 U</span>.S. markets, down <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 186 million</span> in the first quarter <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020 before</span> the pandemic hit, according to</span> data firm CoStar Group Inc. That figure is expected to decline further as developers confront rising vacancies and falling rents in most markets.

What’s next for developers of commercial office space? Join the conversation below.
The national office vacancy rate stands <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 12.5%,</span> up <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.6% in</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 and</span> the highest <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> CoStar said. Just as worrisome for developers:<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 37% of</span> the space under development remains available, more than double the rate in<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 and</span> approaching the <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 39% in</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2008,</span> CoStar said.
“We’re not quite <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2008 levels</span>, but we certainly could get there in the next year,” said Nancy Muscatello, a CoStar senior analyst.
Many companies have told workers to return to their offices after more than two years of remote work. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But businesses also are adopting new workplace strategies that allow employees to work from home a few days during the week.
</span>As a result, tenants need less office space. Most businesses aren’t including expansion space when they sign new leases as they often did in the past, according to brokers. <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 212 million</span> square feet of sublease space is currently available, according to CoStar, a record high <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005 when</span> the company began tracking the metric.
Office landlords had hoped that leasing activity would start to return to prepandemic levels, but there is little sign of that happening, especially now with the threat of a recession looming. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">New tenant searches in October remained below half of their average prepandemic pace <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 and</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019,</span> according to the VTS Office Demand Index.
</span>Not every developer is tapping the brakes. Boston Properties Inc., the office real-estate investment trust, is building <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 390,000</span>-square-foot project in San Jose, Calif., near a planned new Google campus. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We would expect an improvement in market conditions” by the time it is completed in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2024,</span> a spokeswoman said.

From aspirational residences to major commercial deals.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Developers forging ahead say that demand remains strong for the highest-quality space with great locations and amenities such as restaurants, good views, fitness centers and daycare.</span> Businesses adopting new workplace strategies feel it is worth paying higher rents for this space partly because they are leasing less and partly to encourage workers to return to the office for more days.
“They want to find the best space with amenities, with restaurants, with locations to bring their people back,” said Steve Center, senior vice president of American Assets Trust Inc., which is developing <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 200,000</span>-square-foot office building in San Diego without any preleasing.
This strategy has worked for some developers in past downturns. The Durst Organization in New York famously built a 52-story tower in Times Square during the recession of the early 1990s without preleasing and signed Condé Nast Publications before it was completed.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">But high interest rates and rising building costs in the current market have put a new wrinkle in this strategy.</span> Even if developers are able to attract tenants to their new buildings, they might not be able to get the rents they need for their investments to pay off, some analysts say.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“History shows there is likely to be good demand for new and high-quality office space,” said Danny Ismail, a senior analyst at real estate analytics firm Green Street.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“But will demand be there at the rents needed to justify those developments?”

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">But <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996,</span> in need of a challenge and a boost to his business skills, Mr. Dupee enrolled in a joint MBA/JD program at Georgetown University.</span> ""Everyone at Green Mountain thought I'd take my law degree and work for the ACLU,"" he says. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Instead, he landed a job with the distressed-assets group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The group was responsible for searching distressed credit-card, small-business and mortgage debt for salvageable investments to buy and pool together.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Initially, Mr. Dupee's excitement about living in New York, landing a coveted job and working on multimillion-dollar deals buoyed him.</span> But over time, he says, he began to have doubts about his career path. ""It felt like there was something I should be doing that I wasn't.""

For a while he used his sizable paycheck to pursue distractions from his career. He bought tickets to Yankee games and rock concerts, took sailing lessons and skied in the winter. But, in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2003,</span> three years after joining Goldman, Mr. Dupee decided he needed to make a fundamental change. At work, his team was broken up and re-assigned. He wasn't sure the opportunities he wanted would exist going forward. Meanwhile, work-related stress prevented him from sleeping and he began to worry about his health.

Robert Koes, a fellow Wall Streeter and Mr. Dupee's then-roommate, wasn't surprised. ""I think he wanted to prove that he could succeed [at a firm like Goldman], which he did, but he was never that into it,"" Mr. Koes says.

In <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2004,</span> Mr. Dupee went home to Vermont to visit his parents and brought a copy of his r&eacute;sum&eacute; along. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">""I told myself I wasn't job hunting; I was just connecting with people in my network.""</span> A friend there suggested that Mr. Dupee get in touch with Robert Stiller, the founder and then chief executive of Green Mountain.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Back in New York, sitting at a Goldman trading desk, Mr. Dupee got a call from Mr. Stiller, who told him about a position he wanted to create -- a corporate social-responsibility officer who would be the nexus for efforts, including fair-trade coffee, environmental programs and community activism.</span> ""This part of my brain that hadn't been tapped in eight years started to wake up,"" he says. ""I hadn't talked to a dreamer, which is what [Mr. Stiller] is, in years, and it felt really good.""

He took the offer, pay cut and all, and moved back to Vermont. But he no longer works insane hours and now feels his work is in keeping with his values and interests.

It wasn't an entirely easy transition, as Mr. Dupee had to come up to speed on an emerging profession. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That meant figuring out what sorts of efforts are realistic to accomplish, how to work with people in other parts of the business to get those things done and how to measure success.</span> Even though he has returned to his roots, Mr. Dupee says his graduate degrees and prior experience have served him well. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He says that in school and at Goldman, he learned how to navigate office politics, ""speak the language of business"" and to frame environmental or energy-saving initiatives in terms of savings and profits.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">For his part, Mr. Koes isn't surprised that his friend feels at home in his new job.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">""At the end of the day, he could have gotten a degree in 17th-century French literature and ultimately would have found this same job,"" he says.

55049,"<h3>Sweden Says Relaxed Coronavirus Response Is Working, Despite Highest Fatalities in Scandinavia</h3>Sweden’s chief epidemiologist believes the country’s more relaxed coronavirus response is showing signs of working, despite Sweden having more COVID-19 fatalities than other Scandinavian countries.
As countries across Europe have restricted the movement of their citizens, Sweden stands out for what the country’s chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has called a “low-scale” approach that “is much more sustainable” over a longer period.
“We’re on a sort of plateau,” Tegnell told Swedish media outlet TT, according to Bloomberg News.
On Friday, the head of the microbiology department at Sweden’s Public Health Authority, Karin Tegmark Wisell, concurred with this assessment.
“The trend we have seen in recent days, with a more flat curve — where we have many new cases, but not a daily increase — is stabilizing,” Wisell said. “We are seeing the same pattern for patients in intensive care.”
Even so, Sweden’s fatalities and confirmed cases are significantly higher in comparison to other Scandinavian countries. According to the tracker kept by Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases for Scandinavia are:
- Norway:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 165 deaths</span>;<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,078 confirmed</span> cases
- Denmark:<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 355 deaths</span>;<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,580 confirmed</span> cases
- Finland:<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 94 deaths</span>;<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,783 confirmed</span> cases
- Iceland:<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9 deaths</span>;<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,771 confirmed</span> cases
- Sweden:<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,540 deaths</span>;<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,385 confirmed</span> cases
It should be noted, however, that Sweden’s population <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10.2 million</span> is almost double many of its neighbors, with Denmark’s population <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5.8 million</span>; Norway,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.3 million</span>; Finland,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.5 million</span>; and Iceland, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 364,000.</span>
The Scandinavian countries in general all avoided the fatalities seen in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. But their manner of getting there has differed.
Sweden has banned gatherings larger <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 people</span> and encouraged citizens to self-isolate if they are <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 70 years</span> old or have a pre-existing condition that puts them at greater risk from the coronavirus. While high schools and universities in Sweden have closed, schools for younger children have remained open. Sweden’s restaurants and most businesses have also remained open.
Neighboring Denmark, like much of Europe, imposed a stricter lockdown four weeks ago that led to the closing of its borders, schools, and businesses. The Danes are now discussing reopening their country.
Sweden’s ability to flatten the curve was also aided by the fact that more Swedes work from home than any other European country, and over half of Swedish households are single-person residences, which makes social distancing easier.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, while most businesses in Sweden are still operating, the economic cost of the pandemic is already being felt there, just as it is all across Europe and the world.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 25,000 Swedes</span> registered as unemployed last week, which is a larger increase than during <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is still a matter of debate whether Sweden’s more relaxed approach will lead to a better economic outcome, as it is still too soon to tell whether there will be any significant difference between Sweden’s coronavirus-related economic retraction and that of countries like Denmark who took a stricter shutdown approach.
</span>But some observers are optimistic. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">HSBC Global Research economist James Pomeroy said, “While Sweden’s unwillingness to lock down the country could ultimately prove to be ill-judged, for now, if the infection curve flattens out soon, the economy could be better placed to rebound.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">It also appears that Swedes changed their own economic and social behavior in response to the virus without the need for government-imposed restrictions.
</span>Bloomberg News reports that travel “from Stockholm to Gotland — a popular vacation destination — dropped <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 96% over</span> the Easter weekend, according to data from the country’s largest mobile operator, Telia Company. And online service Citymapper’s statistics indicate an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 75% drop</span> in mobility in the capital.”
Lars Ostergaard, chief consultant and professor at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, believes it is too soon to know whether Denmark or Sweden’s approach is best.
“Every day a person is not being infected because of the strict lockdown, we are a day closer to a cure,” Ostergaard said, underlining the advantage of the Danish approach. But he acknowledges that the long-term consequences of a locked-down community could also be “substantial.”
“There is no right or wrong way,” Ostergaard said. “No one has walked this path before, and only the aftermath will show who made the best decision.”

</span>The unscheduled change came after the ruble had regained most of its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Russia’s central bank said on Friday that it would cut its interest rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17 percent</span></span>, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 20 percent</span>, starting Monday amid signs that financial stability risks in the country were easing thanks to capital controls.
</span>The unscheduled rate change came after the ruble had regained most of its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The central bank said that inflation would continue to rise but that recent data had pointed to a slowdown in price increases, in part because of the ruble’s gain.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The annual rate of inflation <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">neared 17 percent</span> at the start of April, but the weekly rate slowed to just <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 1 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17 percent</span>, Russia’s interest rate remains significantly higher than normal.</span> The rate was more than doubled in late February — <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20 percent</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.5 percent</span> — after the ruble plunged following the invasion of Ukraine and the central bank took emergency measures to halt the outflow of money from the country. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While the rate will be brought down slightly, the central bank said on Friday that “external conditions” for the Russian economy were still “challenging” and constraining activity.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The United States and Europe have led sanctions against Russia, intended to isolate it from the global economy.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Access to the central bank’s foreign currency and gold reserves held overseas was blocked.</span> Many Western companies and banks have pulled out of the country. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Major financial institutions have also been affected by sanctions, and governments are increasingly targeting Russia’s energy exports, a crucial source of income.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Last month, Russia’s central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said almost all companies were experiencing disruptions in their production and supply chains and in their dealings with foreign counterparties.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">On Friday, the British government said Russia was heading for its “deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union,” estimating that the economy could shrink as much <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 15 percent</span> this year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the Russian central bank said more rate cuts could be announced at upcoming meetings depending on the path of inflation and economic growth.</span> The next scheduled policy meeting is on <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 29.</span>"
