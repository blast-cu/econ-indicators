41856,"<h3>Analysis | These vaccine skeptics are outperforming news outlets on Facebook, Twitter, study finds</h3>The report, produced by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) think tank, zeroes in on the reach of the popular conservative media site the Daily Wire, founded by Ben Shapiro, and of the Children’s Health Defense, a group founded by longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
It found that Kennedy and his group, which news rating service NewsGuard reports “has published false and unproven scientific and health information,” have more than doubled their Twitter followings since <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2021.</span> And researchers said the Daily Wire has been the most popular news publisher on Facebook since <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2021,</span> with much of its engagement “centered around content critical of vaccines and vaccine policy.”
Researchers say the findings highlight that sites known to spread misleading or false medical information at times dramatically outperform reliable sources on social media, and that anti-vaccine content can be a driver for that engagement.
“Not only are these sites gaining audience share while trafficking in false or misleading claims, these claims seem to be driving some of their engagement,” said Karen Kornbluh, director of GMF’s Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative and an Obama administration alum.
According to the study, the Daily Wire was the top-performing site in terms of engagement every week during the second half <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span></span> and it drew more interactions — likes, comments and shares — than the New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times and NPR combined. And the site garnered “the most [interactions] of any outlet on vaccine mandate articles, and nearly triple the next highest site,” according to the report.
The study also found that the Daily Wire’s posts about vaccine mandates in particular drew significantly more engagement than their typical ones, “indicating that the site found success in pushing content that tapped into ongoing culture wars around U.S. COVID policies.”
NewsGuard has found that the site has “published unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims about COVID-19.”
On Twitter, the Children’s Health Defense has “regularly outperformed more reliable news outlets that met NewsGuard’s criteria for trustworthiness, despite repeatedly publishing false information about COVID-19,” according to the report. That included posts misleadingly claiming that Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates “admitted … that the [COVID] vaccines aren’t effective.”
The findings also raise questions about the efficacy of how platforms have responded to misleading health claims, including by adding information labels to posts and surfacing authoritative sources of medical information.
Researchers found that the Children’s Health Defense “frequently evades fact-check labels” on Twitter. “Anti-vaccine promoters managed to evade platform policies, distorting the information system with out-sized footprints during the second half <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span></span>” researchers wrote.
“It will take stepped-up efforts from the platforms to tackle this problem going forward,” Kornbluh said.
Aaron Simpson, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a statement, “Voicing opposition to government mandates is not against our policies … What we do have clear rules against is harmful COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation.” Twitter teams frequently apply warnings to links posted to the site, and exclude some Tweets with particular links from amplification and recommendations, according to Twitter spokesperson Elizabeth Busby.
Representatives from the Children’s Health Defense and the Daily Wire did not return requests for comment.
A separate GMF report last year found that sites that share news misleadingly, rather than blatantly lying, drew record shares of engagement on Facebook.
Together, the findings show how influential and wide-reading this kind of murky content that often stops just short of falsehood can be online.

Twitter mistakenly deleted accounts exposing Russian disinformation
Researchers have posted evidence on Twitter in recent weeks showing that Russian-made videos claiming to show violence in Ukraine’s separatist regions were faked. But their accounts were deleted, sparking speculation that a Russian-led effort had gotten them banned from the platform, Craig Timberg reports. But Twitter was actually responsible for the problem, with its reviewers mistakenly banning them after concluding that videos posted by researchers were manipulated images, Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said.
Rosborough cited Twitter’s policy against “synthetic and manipulated media.” She also said she knew of less than a dozen accounts that had been affected.
Bellingcat researcher Nick Waters said he <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">counted 15 erroneously</span> blocked accounts. “He welcomed the acknowledgment of error by Twitter but said such problems have happened repeatedly around the world, including in Syria, Turkey and India,” Craig writes.

Amazon Labor Union President Chris Smalls was charged with trespassing, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, Bloomberg News’s Josh Eidelson, Michael Tobin, and Fola Akinnibi report.</span> Two workers who support the union were also arrested, though it’s not clear whether they’ve been charged or released.
It came as the Staten Island Amazon warehouse prepares for a unionization vote in around a month.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Smalls drove into the warehouse’s parking lot to deliver food and union literature for employees to share, union vice president Connor Spence, who said he witnessed the incident, told Bloomberg News.</span> Amazon says it fired Smalls <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 for</span> breaking its safety rules; Smalls said he was raising concerns about its coronavirus policies.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Amazon didn’t say whether it called the police, telling Bloomberg News that it “did not call the police on employees.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel told the outlet that “Smalls — who is not employed by Amazon — has repeatedly trespassed despite multiple warnings.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Today, when police officers asked Mr. Smalls to leave, he instead chose to escalate the situation and the police made their own decision on how to respond.”
Amazon Labor Union attorney Seth Goldstein said that calling the police constituted a violation of a National Labor Relations Board settlement.</span> The outlet couldn’t reach Smalls for comment.

Businesses pump water from aquifers in New Zealand and Australia, prompting protests
On the east coast of New Zealand, a Chinese-owned company has been pumping increasing amounts of water from a local aquifer to quench growing demand among consumers for high-end spring water.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Sales of bottled water by OnePure International Group have grown exponentially since it opened for business five years ago, and most of its products are shipped to China and other parts of Asia.</span> Last year it pumped close <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3 million</span> gallons of spring water from below one of New Zealand’s prime wine-growing districts, to the chagrin of some in the local community.
“We are worried it could become problematic,” said Leanne Cotter-Arlidge, who runs a nonprofit in Hawke’s Bay, the region where OnePure and six other bottled-water operations have been tapping aquifers. The concern, she said, is that the companies will extract too much water and deprive cities and farms in the area of a valuable resource. Her organization is trying to lobby for stepped-up water regulation in the local community and to stop more bottled-water companies from setting up.
OnePure, for its part, said it has worked hard to give back to the local community through sponsorship of local events, and that it is currently pumping less than one-fifth of the water it has been allocated.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Protest groups and court actions have surfaced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere as more businesses are investing in plants to extract and bottle water for China’s growing market.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The concerns are similar to those appearing around the world, where plants and factories that consume large amounts of water are competing with local systems that supply it to neighboring communities and the agriculture sector.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">China currently consumes <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 28 billion</span> gallons of bottled water each year, or more than one-quarter of the world’s supply of the product, according to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2019 report</span> from the Beverage Marketing Corp.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Its consumption is about double that of the U.S., the second-largest market.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yet on a per capita basis, consumption of bottled water in China is still relatively low <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 20 gallons</span>—or <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 150 regular</span>-size bottles—a year, and analysts expect the country’s expanding middle class to drive growth in bottled-water sales for years to come.
</span>Water resources within China are limited. The country <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 20% of</span> the world’s population and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 7% of</span> the world’s fresh water. Around one-quarter of that is polluted—in part because of industrial production and intensive farming practices—according to a January report from China National Environmental Monitoring Center.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">As people care more about the quality of tap water, they are more likely to turn to bottled water instead, said Mark Miao, a Shanghai-based market researcher at Euromonitor International.
</span>Four of <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 largest</span> packaged bottled-water companies world-wide are now Chinese, according to GlobalData, a research and consulting firm. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Most domestic Chinese companies tap local freshwater sources, but some are looking abroad as wealthier consumers are showing a preference for costlier imported spring or mineral water.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The country’s yearly bottled-water imports more than tripled <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2013 and</span><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> when they were valued at <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $664 million</span>, according to Chinese Customs and United Nations trade data.
</span>New Zealand has become an attractive destination for Chinese companies that want to use the country’s environmentally pristine image to sell bottled water. A few years ago, the country’s previous conservative government encouraged foreign investors to buy land and tap its resources. Current officials have been less receptive to the moves.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Nongfu Spring Co., a brand ubiquitous in China for low-price water that retails for as little as two yuan (28 U.S. cents) a bottle, is one of the country’s largest bottled-water producers.</span> It <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 18 plants</span> that tap domestic sources of fresh water.
<span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> Nongfu’s chairman, Zhong Shanshan, was invited by New Zealand officials to consider purchasing a bottling plant in the country’s northeast region near an impoverished town. He came up with a plan to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $42 million</span> to expand the plant and produce as many <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 154,000 bottles</span> of water an hour from an aquifer beneath an orchard near Whakatane.
The plan has been opposed by some locals and a Maori tribe, and is currently tied up in legal action. Opposing factions fear the bottling of water will hurt local farms that rely on groundwater to sustain crops and meet the community’s own needs.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Nongfu said in a statement that the plan has many supporters because it would create jobs.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“This is a dynamic sector and as the market leader in China, Nongfu Spring wishes to be a global market leader in the bottled-water space,” it said.
</span>Near the city of Christchurch, another Chinese-owned bottled-water company has run into hurdles. Just a few months ago, Cloud Ocean Water Ltd., owned by an offshoot of a Chinese sugar conglomerate, said on its website it had ambitions of making New Zealand’s spring water as well known as the popular French brand Evian.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In August, after extracting and shipping bottled water to China <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 11 months</span>, the company suddenly said it was downsizing after sales fell short of its targets.</span> Some area residents had also mounted a legal challenge against Cloud Ocean’s rights to extract large quantities of water from the ground beneath a former wool-washing plant.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We need to protect our water supply for our community,” said Niki Gladding, co-organizer of a group leading the legal action.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“If there wasn’t the potential for such growth in demand…no one would be panicking.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">At OnePure, which is 75%-owned by a Chinese investor and has a local partner, sales and marketing manager Alfred Wong said business is growing but the company is taking less <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20% of</span> the water it has been allocated while it works on its distribution strategy and tries to meet its growth targets.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">“It’s a very competitive market,” Mr. Wong said, adding that OnePure is looking for more ways to get its bottled water onto store shelves in China.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Currently, the product is sold on Chinese e-commerce websites including JD.com’s online mall, where a case of two dozen 500-milliter bottles sell <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 358 yuan</span> ($50), more than double the price of French-produced Evian.</span> In New Zealand, OnePure sells its water for about one-third less.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Adam Sarhan, CEO of investment <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">firm 50 Park</span> Investments, says the market will only stop plumbing new lows once new infections level off.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“What the world, and the market, needs to see is that number stop going up,” he says.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Think of it as a trade: What’s the risk of reopening early?”</span> Sarhan said. “The risk is the number of cases continues to skyrocket, and longer term, you’re just digging a much deeper hole.”
Trump said the White House will reevaluate the matter at the end of the month, which could involve lifting restrictions in regions with lower numbers of infections. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“America will again — and soon — be open for business,” he told reporters at his daily news conference.</span> “Very soon, a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”
The question is also dividing Trump’s own administration.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Top public health officials warn that prematurely lifting measures aimed at separating people to slow transmission of the virus could allow it to surge, which would overwhelm the medical system, prolong the crisis and deepen the toll on human life and the economy.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">But internally, “National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and officials from the Office of Management and Budget are pushing to get the economy back on track as quickly as possible,” my colleagues Josh Dawsey, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Jeff Stein and John Wagner report.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Those advisers are getting backup from conservative economists such as Art Laffer and Steven Moore, who have been “lobbying the White House for more than a week to consider scaling back the recommendation that restaurants, stores and other gathering spots be closed,” per my colleagues.
</span>And some big Wall Street names, including a pair of top Goldman Sachs alums, are making similar points.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">From Trump’s former top economic adviser and former Goldman president Gary Cohn:
From former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein:
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman responded, urging a more aggressive focus on the disease:
There’s no question leaders at the federal level on down face a buffet of bad options.</span> The head of the World Health Organization warned the pandemic is “accelerating,” as it takes a heavier toll in the U.S.. It has now claimed more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 lives</span> here, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 100 in</span> the last day. More <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 41,000 Americans</span> have been infected.
Stay-at-home orders will soon apply <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 158 million</span> Americans, nearly half the population. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">A new estimate from Northwestern University economists projects the measures are working and could <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">prevent 600,000 deaths</span>.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the economic havoc is also growing.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“Private-sector economists project the toll of the crisis will <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">include 5 million</span> lost jobs <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $1.5 trillion</span> in lost economic output,” per the Wall Street Journal's Jon Hilsenrath and Stephanie Armour.</span> ""U.S. stocks have already <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost $12 trillion</span> in value since mid-February, and globally losses have <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shredded $26 trillion</span> from investor portfolios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The stock market continues its record-setting nosedive, with the S&<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 and</span> the Dow Jones industrial average each dropping <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 3 percent</span>.</span> The latest selloff, which keeps the Dow on pace for its worst month <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1931,</span> came after the Senate failed to reach agreement on <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2 trillion</span> emergency relief package. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Investors took little comfort in the announcement by the Federal Reserve of an unprecedented push to backstop the economy.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">But market professionals say a major fiscal response from Congress alone is unlikely reverse the collapse in share prices.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Investors have to be convinced that the US economy is going through a v-shaped recovery before capital markets recover,” Mellon chief economist Vincent Reinhart tells me in an email.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">“The evidence of policy progress will get some initial traction, but money does not get significantly in motion until the real risk is seen as on a more favorable trajectory.”
From RSM chief economist</span> Joe Brusuelas:
Trump said he will consider the counsel of Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other public health officials. But aides say Trump is losing his patience with Fauci, per the New York Times's Maggie Haberman. And at his Monday news conference, the president said, “If it was up to the doctors, they might say, ‘Shut down the entire world.’”
Sarhan’s view: “Who are we to tell the doctors what to do when they’re just trying to grasp of what this is and how to deal with it?”
Some Trump allies share that perspective. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">From Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.):
From Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump's first commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration:
MONEY ON THE HILL
— Still no deal on the Hill, but they say they're closer: “Senate leaders and the Trump administration neared bipartisan agreement on a massive stimulus bill that could <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">inject $2 trillion</span> into the economy to blunt the impacts of the coronavirus,” my colleagues Erica Werner, Paul Kane, Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report.
</span>“After a day of partisan rancor and posturing on Capitol Hill, the outlook grew markedly more positive later in the afternoon, when offers and counteroffers were exchanged. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) convened Democrats on a conference call and told them he was hopeful about striking a deal by the end of the day... Some senators encouraged Schumer to announce a deal in principle Monday evening, but several issues remained unresolved.”
CORONAVIRUS FALLOUT
Corporate fallout:
- Airlines consider shutting down U.S. passenger flights. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The industry is eyeing a voluntary shutdown, as federal agencies decide whether to impose one, the WSJ's Andy Pasztor and Alison Sider report.
- Boeing to shut down all Puget Sound operations for two weeks: The move follows the reported death of an employee due to covid-19; it “affects up <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 70,000 employees</span> in the Puget Sound region who the company said would receive paid leave during the halt,” my colleagues Aaron Gregg and Christian Davenport report.
- Biggest retailers launch hiring spree.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and CVS Health Corp. are among about a dozen large companies looking to hire <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 500,000 Americans</span> in coming weeks, a spree that would mark a major shift of the U.S. workforce from smaller businesses and others that have cut staff to survive the coronavirus,” per the WSJ.
- Auto industry urges lawmakers to ensure liquidity: “Trade groups representing the companies including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., said in a letter … that Congress should set up facilities ‘to provide loans and loan guarantees to large employers, medium-size manufacturers and small businesses,’” Reuters's David Shepardson reports.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">- Grocers struggle to meet demand: “The run has exposed the downside of the food industry’s push to hold less stock in warehouses and operate fewer, fuller trucks to increase profit margins,” the WSJ's Annie Gasparro, Jennifer Smith and Jaewon Kang report of the abrupt shift in strategy underway.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Just one stat of where there are: “Retail sales of paper towels, black beans and tuna rose <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 150 percent</span> in the week ended <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 14 vs</span>. the year-earlier week, according to market-research firm Nielsen.”
- GM looks at building ventilators at Indiana plant: “GM said … that work at its Indiana plant, which makes small electronic components for cars, is part of the effort to expand ventilator production,” Reuters's Ben Klayman reports.
- Retailers try to juice sales with online deals: But experts are skeptical that it will work.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“You can discount in a demand-weak environment, but it doesn’t matter,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData retail, CNBC's Sarah Whitten reports.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">- Six of Trump's clubs have been shuttered: The move potentially deprives Trump’s company of millions of dollars in revenue, my colleagues David A. Fahrenthold, Joshua Partlow and Jonathan O'Connell report.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">MARKET MOVERS
— Stock futures rally.</span> Bloomberg News's Sam Potter: ""U.S. index futures and European stocks rallied alongside Asian shares on Tuesday as investors rediscovered some appetite for risk after global equities hit their lowest level <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The dollar slumped following a 10-day winning streak, and Treasuries slipped.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">— Brent crude edged higher: “Oil prices inched higher … while U.S. gasoline prices plunged more <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 percent</span> to a record low as global restrictions on travel to slow the spread of coronavirus destroyed demand for fuel,” Reuters's Devika Krishna Kumar reports.
— The Fed deploys even more weapons.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The Post's Heather Long: ""With restaurants, airlines, hotels, auto manufacturers and so many other parts of the economy at a standstill, there’s a massive need for short-term loans to help businesses survive until people can go out again.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">But just as demand for loans is growing, investors are showing little appetite to buy up all this debt, preferring instead to hold on to cash.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">“The Fed is attempting to resolve this by buying unlimited amounts of U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, an extraordinary backstop for lending markets that goes much further than what the central bank did in the 2008-2009 crisis.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Back then, the Fed injected <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4 trillion</span> into the financial system over several years.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Analysts say the Fed’s effort now could dwarf that in a matter of weeks, a testament to how much pain the coronavirus is causing the economy.”
</span>The details:
- Unlimited purchases. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Via the WSJ's Nick Timiraos: “Among the actions announced Monday, the Fed said that the purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities that it approved one week ago are essentially unlimited and that it would <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy $375 billion</span> in Treasury securities <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $250 billion</span> in mortgage securities this week.”
- Three new lending facilities: “The Fed announced three new lending facilities to unclog credit markets <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $30 billion</span> in support from the Treasury, which officials said would <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">enable $300 billion</span> in financing…</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">The Fed will lend money to investors to buy securities backed by credit-card loans and other consumer debt.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Two new facilities will support lending for large companies, an unprecedented step for the Fed.</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">""
- New support for small and medium-sized businesses: “The Fed said it would soon roll out a Main Street Business Lending Program that will support lending to eligible small and midsize businesses.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">Such a program is likely to depend on additional money from the Treasury Department, and the Fed didn’t provide details about it Monday.”
</span>Trump says he called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to thank him. The president offered rare praise for the central bank chief at his news conference: “I really think he’s caught up. He’s really stepped up over the last week. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">I called him today and I said ‘Jerome, good job.’</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">”
TRUMP TRACKER
TRADE FLY-AROUND:
— U.S., Chinese officials talk about sharing medical equipment.</span> NYT's Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson: ""American front-line medical personnel are running desperately short of masks and protective equipment as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. China, already the world’s largest producer of such gear by far, has ramped up factory output and is now signaling that it wants to help.
“Reaching deals won’t be easy. Increasingly acrimonious relations between Washington and Beijing are complicating efforts to get Chinese-made masks to American clinics and hospitals. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">A breakdown over the last few days in the global business of moving goods by air around the world will make it costly and difficult as well.”
</span>Chinese diplomats split over Trump: “An unusual public spat between two top Chinese diplomats points to an internal split in Beijing over how to handle rising tensions with a combative U.S. president,” Bloomberg News reports.
“The differences spilled into public view Monday after China’s ambassador to the U.S. reaffirmed his opposition to promoting theories that the virus that causes Covid-19 originated in an American military lab …Cui’s comments represent a sharp public rebuke to foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by U.S. Army athletes.”

72580,"<h3>Pound Plunges on U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">All asset classes down as final result of referendum is announced

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 24,</span></span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 2</span>:32 am ET

Britain’s vote to leave the European Union battered the British pound by more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 11% Thursday</span> night and into Friday morning, pushed down stocks in Asia and pointed to a day of steep falls across the world’s financial markets.</span> It was a brutal drubbing for investors who had stacked up bets that the U.K. would choose to stay.

The pound traded as low <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1.3230 in</span> London’s early hours, as a pink-fringed dawn rose over the city and the British Broadcasting Corp. called the referendum for Leave. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That was the lowest level against the dollar <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1985,</span> and an epic move for a developed-market currency.</span> The pound edged back up and was <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.36 by</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7 a</span>.m. Just hours before, it had peaked <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $1.50.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Futures markets in the U.S. pointed to the S&P 500’s opening down 5%; in Britain they indicated a fall in the benchmark stock index of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 9%.</span>

</span>Nothing was spared from the tumult. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Brent, the international oil price gauge, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shed 4.97% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $48.38 a</span> barrel in early trade on Friday.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">London copper prices dropped <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3% to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $4,643.50 a</span> metric ton.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The vertiginous moves portend unruly trading ahead.</span> Stocks had been on a steady uplift this week following a series of polls that suggested a victory for Remain. That enthusiasm continued through the day Thursday. By the time polls closed <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. British time, gamblers had staked so many bets for Remain that betting exchange Betfair calculated <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 94% chance</span> that the side would carry the day.

Then the counting started. A hairbreadth win for Remain in Newcastle, in the northeast of England, started to deflate the pound, as did reports of Leave victories in smaller districts. Sunderland, a Labour-leaning port city where anger at the EU runs high, reported <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 61.3% Leave</span> tally. The pound slammed down, falling more <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% in</span> minutes.

In Tokyo, Yusuke Sakai, a senior trader at T&D Asset Management, got a shock geography lesson. “Wow!” he said. “What a big move. I don’t even know where this is? It must be a rural town or something. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The currency is moving more than ¥2.”

Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at equities trader IG Markets in Melbourne, Australia, said a sense of high anxiety swept global markets as the pound plunged in the space of seconds, and it was evident in messaging coming across screens from the firm’s U.K. home office.

</span>Mr. Nicholson said for a few moments “it was squeaky bum time” in his dealing room, as an earlier sense of reassuredness around a win for the Remain camp was swept aside. “<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 4% move</span> within a second is pretty wild. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In currency-market terms, it’s a black-swan event.”

</span>Bob Browne, chief investment officer at Northern Trust, was sitting in his car Thursday evening in Highland Park, Ill., waiting for his son to come out of a doctor’s appointment. He was checking his cellphone for the latest voting results, with early signs that an upset was in the cards. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“Some of the early polls have come in, and the market is revisiting its rock-solid assumption just a few hours ago that the U.K. would stay in,” he said.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 3 a</span>.m. in London, five hours after the polls had closed, Betfair put the odds of Britain’s remaining <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 56%.</span> A victory for Leave in Swansea, in South Wales, helped drive the pound still lower—down <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $1.41,</span> off more <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5% from</span> just before the polls closed.

The day had started better for traders who had staked money on Remain. An online survey conducted on the day of the referendum by pollsters YouGov <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">showed 52% support</span> for the Remain camp, <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">against 48% for</span> Leave. The survey was released minutes after the polls shut.

The YouGov survey matched a number of other signals that Remain had the upper hand in the final stretch of a hard-fought, seesawing contest. Ben Page, chief executive of pollster Ipsos Mori, tweeted Thursday night that his company continued polling Wednesday and Thursday, <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suggesting 54% support</span> for the pro-EU camp, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">against 46% for</span> the campaign to leave the EU.

Shortly after the polls closed, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who has spearheaded the Leave camp, said that he expects the Remain camp to win, according to broadcaster Sky News. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Farage later told the Press Association newswire that his estimate is based on “friends in the financial markets who have done some big polling.”

</span>But the early counting sharply shifted that sentiment, and with it many markets. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Stock futures fell sharply in the early hours.</span> Investors were also keeping a careful watch on gold, which has served as a hedge against Brexit, and government bonds—especially those of the U.K. Gold futures shot up as the result became plain and were <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5% early</span> Friday, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1,326.40 an</span> ounce. The precious metal rallied to as high <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1,317.51 an</span> ounce last week as risk assets sold off around the world.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the center of the market’s attention is the pound.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The currency had closely tracked the betting odds of a Remain victory, which rose <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 58% on</span> Thursday <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 88% just</span> before polls closed <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. U.K. time.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">One-month implied volatility in sterling—a measure of the price of options contracts on the pound—reached its highest levels since the 2008-09 financial crisis last week, but has declined slightly since.

</span>The Stoxx <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 600 climbed</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.5%,</span> London’s <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">FTSE 100 gained</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.2% and</span> Germany’s DAX <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.8%.</span> It was the fifth consecutive session of gains for all three indexes.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">In recent days worries that a British exit from the EU will stoke global economic uncertainty has roiled financial markets, spurring wild swings in the pound, euro and other currencies.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">That has prompted banks to caution clients against taking large positions in a market where currencies could gyrate and liquidity may dry up.</span> Banks are widening spreads—the gap between pricing for bids and offers—to account for the greater risks from expected turbulence.

WASHINGTON — <span id=""0"" class=""red"">As President Trump demanded a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the past year, Canada staked out a position squarely at odds with the White House:</span> Any new pact must recognize climate change.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">That demand is now facing a test.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The United States and Mexico, the other two parties to the three-nation trade deal, in recent days have hammered out a possible revision of the pact, and Mr. Trump is urging Canada to sign on or be hit with automobile tariffs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The revised terms don’t mention climate change, according to the scant details made public Monday, and the Trump administration has long dismissed the science that shows global warming poses a serious threat to people and economies.
</span>Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, was in Washington on Tuesday to continue negotiations. Her government so far has given little indication of its intentions beyond a statement by Ms. Freeland’s spokesman, Adam Austen, who said the priority was that any deal be “good for the middle class.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Canada’s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement.
</span>In France, the environment minister quit during a live radio interview on Tuesday, saying the nation wasn’t doing enough on green issues. And last week in Australia, the prime minister was unseated by a challenger with strong coal-industry connections. Canada, much like Australia, has a powerful energy industry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a challenge from politicians aligned with the oil industry there. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, also has vowed to fight Mr. Trudeau’s plan to put a price on carbon emission in Canada when it takes effect next year.
</span>For reasons like these, Canadian environmental activists and United States foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government would have to pick and choose its priorities in the tense coming days, and many say climate change most likely will not make the cut. The Trump administration has opposed any mention of the phrase.
“I don’t think that’s going to happen at this point,” said George David Banks, former international energy and environment adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Banks said neither the Trump administration nor Mexico appeared interested in pursuing climate change in Nafta.
Mr. Trump has said if a compromise cannot be negotiated with Canada he will cut the country out of the deal. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It’s not at all clear, though, that Congress — which must sign off on any trade deal before it takes effect — would accept that.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">For Canada the risks are both economic and political.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, American exports to Canada have <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 165 percent</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1993,</span> the year before Nafta came into force, and imports from Canada <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 150 percent</span>.</span> If Mr. Trudeau is unable to strike a deal with Mr. Trump he could come off looking weak in the eyes of his public. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But if Mr. Trump imposes <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 25 percent</span> tariff on automobiles it would hit hard the economic powerhouse province of Ontario.
</span>The absence of climate change language wouldn’t have an immediate effect on the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions projections from Canada, the United States or Mexico. After all, the current agreement also makes no mention of the need to drive down global warming.
But environmentalists say that failing to incorporate a mention would be a missed opportunity to make a statement in support of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 Paris</span> Agreement, which calls on <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 200 nations</span> to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and which did not exist when Nafta was drafted.
“It violates the norm that the environment belongs at the negotiating table,” said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“We seem to be pushing our trading partners to say, ‘It’s prosperity or the environment.</span> It’s prosperity or human rights,’” he said, arguing that it shouldn’t be thought of as an either-or.
Canada, for its part, has made climate change a centerpiece of its international agenda. It features prominently in the title, for example, of upcoming discussions at the Group <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 energy</span> discussions slated for Nova Scotia in September.
But the Canadian government also has sought out ways to avoid isolating the Trump administration by bringing less antagonizing issues, for instance cleaning plastic from the oceans, to the table.
When it comes to Nafta, the Trudeau government has taken a similarly pliable position. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">In August, Ms. Freeland outlined Canada’s vision for what it called “progressive elements” to any new trilateral trade deal.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The priorities: strengthening labor safeguards and incorporating new chapters on gender equality, indigenous rights and climate change.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">On climate, Mr. Trudeau maintained that he wanted to see the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to move to a low-carbon economy to be written into the new Nafta.
</span>“We are certainly looking for a better level playing field across North America on environmental protections,” Mr. Trudeau said last year.
Shortly after that remark, the Canadian foreign affairs minister sent the Trump administration a proposed chapter that included those elements but did not require the United States to accept or embrace the Paris Agreement.
However, late last year the Trump administration declined to accept that language, according to Mr. Banks and a Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request to discuss the role of that agenda in this week’s talks.
</span>“The big question will be to what extent Canada will be interested in going to the wall on climate,” said Dale Marshall, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, a Canadian nonprofit group. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“When the rubber hits the road and we’re talking about economic trade, does Canada feel strong enough about those issues to be willing to scuttle a deal?</span> I’m not sure,” he said.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Joshua C. Zive, a trade lobbyist who works with energy and utility companies for the firm Bracewell in Washington, said he did not think pushing climate change this week would be in Canada’s negotiating interest.</span> Already, he said, the Trump administration is intent on casting Mr. Trudeau as the scapegoat if a deal falls through.
“It’s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,” Mr. Zive said. “If it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Mr. Zive for his part questioned the need to incorporate climate change into Nafta, and said the trade deal had always been a fairly technical way to deal with specific products like automobiles.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">If negotiators push for a mention of climate change “just for symbolic purposes, you’re also importing the symbolic controversy,” he said.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“There is no need to force people to resolve this in an already-complicated and high-stakes trade dispute.”
Mr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration.
</span>“As the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States’ competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,” he said.

The government's bank stress tests deserve a B-minus.

To give a sustained boost to investor confidence, the tests needed demonstrable rigor. They achieved that up to a point. While worst-case loss rates look tough, certain loan portfolios -- in particular commercial real estate -- at some banks seem to have gotten off lightly. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the tests' numbers for underlying earnings -- which are needed to offset soaring credit losses -- could turn out to be optimistic in some cases.

</span>It is hard to quibble with most of the government's worst-case loss rates, which are calculated for this year and next. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">For example, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.8% loss</span> rate for first-lien mortgages seems suitably tough, even when taking into account the aggressive underwriting during the housing bubble.</span> The government'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 13.8% worst</span>-case loss-rate for second-lien mortgages seems fair. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But it is a stretch to think Wells Fargo <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">WFC 1.79</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle, with its large home-equity book focused on stressed housing markets, will have a lower-than-sector loss rate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 13.2%.</span>

</span>The government may have been too optimistic in positing <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.5% commercial</span>-real-estate loss rate. This sector is just starting to fall apart, and defaults may move sharply higher as borrowers struggle to refinance loans. BB&T's commercial-real-estate worst case is higher <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 12.6%,</span> but its portfolio may arguably show higher losses.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The government's earnings projections also need to be taken with a pinch of salt.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It is optimistic to assume banks can repeat their first-quarter revenue generation, for instance.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Given the Fed has unleashed a tidal wave of liquidity into the system, interest rates are going to be extremely volatile for several quarters, making bank revenue very hard to predict.

</span>Another reason to be skeptical is few banks have to substantially increase overall levels of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 1 capital</span>, which includes common and preferred shares, by raising new money. The government is effectively saying most large banks were solidly capitalized even when investors fled earlier this year.

Instead of immediately raising overall capital levels, some banks are just shifting the mix toward common equity -- the highest-quality capital. Lenders that need to raise fresh money include GMAC, General Motors' lending arm. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Also, Wells Fargo's offering of common stock, announced Thursday, suggests its overall capital will increase.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Finally, the government has effectively said it wants banks to have <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tier 1 common</span> stock equivalent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4% of</span> risk-weighted assets.</span> First, investors have to decide whether they have confidence in the risk weightings.

Second, Tier-1 measures of capital leave out certain unrealized losses on securities that could become real later -- something captured by tangible-common-equity ratios.

Then they must decide <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whether 4% </span>-- which still translates into 25-to-1 leverage -- is safe for the unpredictable environment we are in.

Italy now has more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 53,000 recorded</span> infections and more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,800 dead</span>, and the rate of increase keeps growing, with more than half the cases and fatalities coming in the past week. On Saturday, officials <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reported 793 additional</span> deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting pandemic.
The government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in Lombardy, the northern region at the center of the outbreak, where bodies have piled up in churches. On Friday night, the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.
The tragedy of Italy now stands as a warning to its European neighbors and the United States, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. If Italy’s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion — when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.
</span>Italy’s piecemeal attempts to cut it off — isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown — always lagged behind the virus’s lethal trajectory.
“Now we are running after it,” said Sandra Zampa, the under secretary at the Ministry of Health, who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had. “We closed gradually, as Europe is doing. France, Spain, Germany, the U.S. are doing the same. Every day you close a bit, you give up on a bit of normal life. Because the virus does not allow normal life.”
Some officials gave in to magical thinking, reluctant to make painful decisions sooner. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">All the while, the virus fed on that complacency.
</span>Governments beyond Italy are now in danger of following the same path, repeating familiar mistakes and inviting similar calamity. And unlike Italy, which navigated uncharted territory for a Western democracy, other governments have less room for excuses.
Italian officials, for their part, have defended their response, emphasizing that the crisis is unprecedented in modern times. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They assert that the government responded with speed and competence, immediately acting on the advice of its scientists and moving more swiftly on drastic, economically devastating measures than their European counterparts.
</span>But tracing the record of their actions shows missed opportunities and critical missteps that have left the country in its worse state since World War II.
In the critical early days of the outbreak, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and other top officials sought to down play the threat, creating confusion and a false sense of security that allowed the virus to spread.
They blamed Italy’s high number of infections on aggressive testing of people without symptoms in the north, which they argued only created hysteria and tarnished the country’s image abroad.
Even once the Italian government considered a universal lockdown necessary to defeat the virus, it failed to communicate the threat powerfully enough to persuade Italians to abide by the rules, which seemed riddled with loopholes.
“It is not easy in a liberal democracy,” said Walter Ricciardi, a World Health Organization board member and a top adviser to the health ministry, who argued that the Italian government acted on the scientific evidence made available to it.
He said the Italian government had moved at a much faster clip, and took the threat much more seriously, than its European neighbors or the United States.
Still, he acknowledged that the health minister had struggled to persuade his government colleagues to move more quickly and that the difficulties of navigating Italy’s division of powers between Rome and the regions resulted in a fragmented chain of command and inconsistent messages.
“In times of war, like an epidemic,” that system presented grave problems, he said, adding that it perhaps delayed the imposing of restrictive measures.
“I would have done <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">them<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 days</span></span> before, that is the only difference.”
It Could Never Happen Here
For the coronavirus,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 days</span> can be a lifetime.
On Jan.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span> as top Chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases “will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,” Italy’s culture and tourism minister hosted a Chinese delegation for a concert at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to inaugurate the year of Italy-China Culture and Tourism.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Michele Geraci, Italy’s former under secretary in the economic development ministry and a booster of closer relations with China, had a drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily.
</span>“Are we sure we want to do this?” he said he asked them. “Should we be here today?”
With the benefit of hindsight, Italian officials say certainly not.
Ms. Zampa, the health ministry under secretary, said in retrospect she would have closed everything immediately. But in real time, it wasn’t that clear.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Politicians across the spectrum worried about the economy and feeding the country, and found it difficult to accept their impotence in the face of the virus.
</span>Most importantly, Italy looked at the example of China, Ms. Zampa said, not as a practical warning, but as a “science fiction movie that had nothing to do with us.” And when the virus exploded, Europe, she said, “looked at us the same way we looked at China.”
But already in January, some officials on the right were urging Mr. Conte, their former ally and now political enemy, to quarantine schoolchildren in the northern regions who were returning from holidays in China, a measure aimed at protecting schools. Many of those children were from Chinese immigrant families.
Many liberals criticized the proposal as populist fear-mongering. Mr. Conte declined the proposal and responded that the northern governors should trust the judgment of education and health authorities whom, he said, had proposed no such thing.
But Mr. Conte also demonstrated that he was taking the threat of contagion seriously. On Jan.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span> he blocked all flights in and out of China.
“We are the first country in Europe to adopt such a precautionary measure,” he said.
Over the next month, Italy responded swiftly to coronavirus scares. Two sick Chinese tourists and an Italian returning from China received care from a prominent infectious disease hospital in Rome. A false alarm led authorities to briefly confine passengers on a cruise ship docked outside of Rome.
‘Patient One,’ Super-spreader
When a 38-year-old man went to the emergency room at a hospital in Codogno, a small town in the Lodi province of Lombardy, with severe flu symptoms on Feb.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18,</span> the case did not set off alarms.
The patient declined to be hospitalized and went home. He got sicker and returned to the hospital a few hours later and was admitted to a general medicine ward. On Feb.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span> he went into intensive care, where he tested positive for the virus.
The man, who became known as Patient One, had had a busy month. He attended at least three dinners, played soccer and ran with a team, all apparently while contagious and without heavy symptoms.
Mr. Ricciardi said Italy had the bad luck of having a super spreader in a densely populated and dynamic area who went to the hospital not once, but twice, infecting hundreds of people, including doctors and nurses.
“He was incredibly active,” Mr. Ricciardi said.
But he also had not had any direct contacts with China, and experts suspect he contracted the virus from another European, meaning Italy did not have an identifiable patient zero or a traceable source of contagion that could help it contain the virus.
The virus had already been active in Italy for weeks by that time, experts now say, passed by people without symptoms and often mistaken for a flu. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It spread around Lombardy, the Italian region that has by far the most trade with China and the home of Milan, the country’s most culturally vibrant and business-centered city.
</span>“Who we call ‘Patient One’ was probably ‘<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Patient 200,</span>’ ” said Fabrizio Pregliasco, an epidemiologist.
On Sunday, Feb.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> the number of infections clicked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">passed 130 and</span> Italy sealed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">off 11 towns</span> with police and military checkpoints. The last days of Venice Carnival were canceled. The Lombardy region closed its schools, museums and movie theaters. The Milanese made a run on the supermarkets.
But while Mr. Conte again commended Italy for its firm hand, he also sought to downplay the contagion, attributing the high numbers of infected to Lombardy’s overzealous testing.
“We have been the first country in the European Union to opt for more rigorous and strict controls in airports and cities,” he said in an address to the nation. “We have more people infected because we made more swabs.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The next day, as infections <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed 200,</span> seven people died and the stock market plunged, Mr. Conte and his health aides doubled down.
</span>He blamed the Codogno hospital for the spread, saying it had handled things in “a not-completely-proper way” and argued that Lombardy and Veneto, another northern region, were inflating the severity of the problem by diverging from global guidelines and testing people without symptoms.
As Lombardy officials scrambled to free up hospital beds, and the number of infected people rose <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 309 with</span><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11 dead</span>, Mr. Conte said on Feb.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25 that</span> “Italy is a safe country and probably safer than many others.”
On Friday, Mr. Conte’s office offered an interview on the condition that he could answer questions in writing. When sent questions, including those about his past statements, he declined to respond.
Mixed Messages Sow Confusion
Reassurances from leaders confused the Italian population.
On Feb.<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> Mr. Zingaretti posted his aperitivo picture. That same day, the country’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, the former leader of one of the governing parties, the Five Star Movement, held a news conference in Rome.
“In Italy, we went from the risk of an epidemic to an infodemic,” Mr. Di Maio said, disparaging media coverage that highlighted the threat of the contagion, and adding that only “0.089 percent” of the Italian population was quarantined.
In Milan, only miles from the center of the outbreak, the mayor, Beppe Sala, publicized a ‘‘Milan Doesn’t Stop’’ campaign, and the Duomo, the city’s landmark cathedral that is a draw for tourists, reopened. People went out.
But on the sixth floor of the regional government headquarters in Milan, Giacomo Grasselli, who is the coordinator of the intensive care units throughout Lombardy, saw the numbers going up and quickly realized that it would be impossible to treat all the sick if the infections continued unabated.
His task force worked to match the sick to beds in intensive-care units in the nearest possible hospitals and appropriate dwindling resources.
At one of the daily meetings of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 health</span> and political officials, he told the regional president, Attilio Fontana, about the growing numbers.
An epidemiologist showed the curves of infection. There was a catastrophe facing the region’s well-respected health system.
“We need to do something more,” Mr. Grasselli told the room.
Mr. Fontana, who had been pressing the central government for tougher action, agreed. He said that the mixed messages from Rome and the easing of restrictions had led Italians to believe “that everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to.”
He said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“They were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,” said Mr. Fontana.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 25 billion</span> euro ($28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn’t.
</span>Ms. Zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of Vò, the virus epicenter of the Veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the Codogno outbreak.
She said that the health minister, Mr. Speranza, and Mr. Conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In a <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surprise 2 a</span>.m. news conference on <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 8,</span> <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">when 7,375 people</span> had already tested positive for coronavirus <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 366 had</span> died, Mr. Conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country’s economic engine.
</span>“We are facing an emergency,” Mr. Conte said at the time. “A national emergency.”
A draft of the decree, leaked to Italian media on Saturday night, pushed many Milan residents to rush to the train station in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.
Yet the following day, most Italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.
To clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued “auto-certification” forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or “other” necessities.
In the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self quarantine. Others didn’t.
The broader restrictions in Lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on Codogno and other “red zone” towns linked to the original outbreak. Checkpoints disappeared. Local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.
Three days later, on <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 11,</span> when the positive cases <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 12,462 and</span> the death toll climbed <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 827,</span> Mr. Conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.
But by then, some experts say, it was already too late.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Local Experiments
Italy is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians.</span> The staggering number of recent deaths — more <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2,300 in</span> the last four days — are of people infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.
Roberto Burioni, a prominent virologist at the San Raffaele University in Milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to “that behavior.”
The government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. But on Saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.
Leaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.
On Friday, Mr. Fontana complained that <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 114 troops</span> the government deployed were insignificant, and that at <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 1,000 should</span> be sent. He said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and “apply rigid measures.”
“My idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,” he said.
His political ally, Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, pre-empted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that Rome needed to enforce “a more drastic isolation,” including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.
“Walks should be banned,” he said.
Mr. Zaia has some credibility on the issue. As new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in Vò, a town of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3,000 people</span> that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country’s first coronavirus death.
Some government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. But Mr. Zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. The government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.
“At least this slows down the virus’ speed,’’ Mr. Zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. ‘‘And slowing down the virus’ speed allows the hospitals to breathe.’’
If not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.
Americans and others, he said, “need to be ready.”"
49071,"<h3>Don’t Celebrate the End of Austerity</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Rising federal spending when the economy doesn’t need it points to need for better budget ‘automatic stabilizers’

Updated Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span> 2016</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">12:32 pm ET

Congress brought the curtain down on five years of austerity when it passed a budget deal last month.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">By loosening spending caps and extending various tax breaks, the agreement means that combined federal, state and local spending and taxes will contribute to growth this year for the first time <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span>

</span>The end of austerity isn’t, however, cause for celebration. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rather, it simply underlines how the budget’s role as a counter-cyclical economic shock absorber has fallen victim to ideological differences over the size of government.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ideally, budgets should stimulate the economy in busts and dampen spending in booms.</span> That rule went out the window <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011 when</span> Republicans in Congress and President Barack Obama enacted multiyear spending limits when they couldn’t agree on long-term changes to spending and taxes. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">These were a major contributor to the “fiscal drag” that Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips estimates sliced an average <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.2 percentage</span> points off growth annually <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The hit to the economy was all the harder because the Federal Reserve couldn’t compensate by cutting interest rates, since they already were near zero.

</span>This year will be the mirror image <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">With the spending caps loosened and several tax cuts becoming permanent, fiscal policy has now turned stimulative.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">This comes too late to help: unemployment, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5%,</span> is back to normal and the Fed has started raising rates to prevent an eventual outbreak of inflation.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">If Congress last year instead had elected to keep the deficit down, the Fed could have neutralized the economic impact by raising rates even more slowly than it now plans.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">To be sure, fiscal and monetary policy don’t always work at cross-purposes.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Federal spending on unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps automatically rises in recessions while corporate and income taxes drop.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 these</span> “automatic stabilizers” added <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $300 billion</span> to the federal deficit.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">This was less than a third of the estimated shortfall in economic output from its normal level.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Historically, it didn’t matter that automatic stabilizers dampened only part of the economy’s booms and bust, because the Fed could do the rest of the job.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">But <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2000,</span> the Fed has twice cut rates to between zero <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1% without</span> fully offsetting recessionary forces, and politicians have responded with big “stimulus” packages that become platforms for broader political goals.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">President George W. Bush used the weakness of the economy <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2001 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2003 to</span> justify, then accelerate, his tax cuts.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Mr. Obama’s stimulus program directed money to green energy and high-speed rail, and included several measures meant to become permanent, such as an expanded tax credits for the working poor, children and college education, and increased Pell Grants.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Many Republicans saw the Obama stimulus as government overreach, one reason for their embrace of austerity <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011.</span>

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Such conflicts could be avoided with stronger automatic stabilizers, which could obviate the need for discretionary stimulus.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">This is likely to become even more urgent, because the Fed is losing its own counter-cyclical punch.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Fed officials think the “equilibrium” interest rate, which keeps the economy at full strength and inflation at bay, is <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 3.25% to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.5% compared</span> with <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 4% before</span> the recession.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">The reason is that slumping productivity and investment, risk aversion and an aging population have sapped borrowing demand.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Research by John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and Fed economist Thomas Laubach suggests the equilibrium rate could be as low <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 2%,</span> or zero when adjusted for inflation.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">This means the Fed may have only two percentage points of interest-rate cuts available to fight the next recession (compared <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 5.25 points</span> in 2007).

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">“I am worried that a very low equilibrium rate makes it harder for monetary policy to do the full job of counter-cyclical stabilization policy in downturns,” Mr. Williams said in an interview.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">That, he said, means fiscal policy will need to play a bigger role.

</span>But how? <span id=""27"" class=""red"">More infrastructure spending is a perennial favorite of stimulus advocates, but the reality is that planning and politics make infrastructure hard to quickly ramp up and down.</span> Doug Elmendorf, dean of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, suggests varying the federal share of Medicaid, which would take pressure off states that would otherwise have to shrink spending to balance their budgets. Mr. Williams proposes automatically cutting payroll taxes during recessions.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Just as important as activating such stimulus during downturns is deactivating it during recoveries: payroll taxes must go back up, and the federal Medicaid share go back down.</span> As Mr. Williams notes, the point is to have policies “on autopilot that have nothing to do with the role of government in our society.” <span id=""29"" class=""red"">By all means, that role should be debated—but not as a way to manage the business cycle.

22778,"<h3>Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming</h3>HOUSTON — A surge of oil production is coming, whether the world needs it or not.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The flood of crude will arrive even as concerns about climate change are growing and worldwide oil demand is slowing.</span> And it is not coming from the usual producers, but from Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana — countries that are either not known for oil or whose production has been lackluster in recent years.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">This looming new supply may be a key reason Saudi Arabia’s giant oil producer, Aramco, pushed ahead on Sunday with plans for what could be the world’s largest initial stock offering ever.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Together, the four countries stand to add nearly a million barrels a day to the market <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 and</span> nearly a million more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> on top of the current world crude output <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 80 million</span> barrels a day.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">That boost in production, along with global efforts to lower emissions, will almost certainly push oil prices down.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Lower prices could prove damaging for Aramco and many other oil companies, reducing profits and limiting new exploration and drilling, while also reshaping the politics of the nations that rely on oil income.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new rise in production is likely to bring economic relief to consumers at the gas pump and to importing nations like China, India and Japan.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But cheaper oil may complicate efforts to combat global warming and wean consumers and industries off their dependence on fossil fuels, because lower gasoline prices could, for example, slow the adoption of electric vehicles.
</span>Canada, Norway, Brazil and Guyana are all relatively stable at a time of turbulence for traditional producers like Venezuela and Libya and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Their oil riches should undercut efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to support prices with cuts in production and give American and other Western policymakers an added cushion in case there are renewed attacks on oil tankers or processing facilities in the Persian Gulf.

Daniel Yergin, the energy historian who wrote “The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Power and Money,” compared the impact of the new production to the advent of the shale oil boom in Texas and North Dakota a decade ago.
“Since all four of these countries are largely insulated from traditional geopolitical turmoil, they will add to global energy security,” Mr. Yergin said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But he also predicted that as with shale, the incremental supply gain, combined with a sluggish world economy, could drive prices lower.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">There is already a glut on the world market, even with exports from Venezuela and Iran sharply curtailed by American sanctions.</span> Should their production come back, that glut would only expand.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Years of moderate gasoline prices have already increased the popularity of bigger cars and sports utility vehicles in the United States, and the probability of more oil on the market is bound to weigh on prices at the pump over the next few years.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The oil-supply outlook is a sharp departure from the early 2000s, when prices soared as producers strained to keep up with ballooning demand in China and some analysts warned that the world was running out of oil.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Then came the rise of hydraulic fracturing and drilling through tight shale fields, which converted the United States from a needy importer into a powerful exporter.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The increase in American production, along with a choppy global economy, shaved oil prices from well <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $100 a</span> barrel before the 2007-9 recession to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $56 on</span> Friday for the American benchmark crude.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Those low prices have forced OPEC and Russia to lower production in recent years, and this year many financially struggling American oil companies have slashed their exploration and production investments to pay down their debts and protect their dividends.

The new oil will accelerate those trends, energy experts say, even if only for a few years as production declines in older fields in other places.
</span>“This could spell disaster for every producer and producing country,” said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, an energy consultancy, especially if the United States and Iran come to some sort of nuclear deal.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Like the shale boom, the coming supply surge is a sudden change in dynamics.</span> Guyana currently produces no oil at all. Norwegian and Brazilian production has long been in decline. And in Canada, concerns about climate change, resistance to new pipelines and high production costs have curtailed investments in oil-sands fields for five consecutive years.
Production of more oil comes at a time when there is growing acknowledgment by governments and energy investors that not all the hydrocarbons in the ground can be tapped if climate change is to be controlled. But exploration decisions, made years ago, have a momentum that can be hard to stop.
“Legacy decisions keep going,” said John Browne, BP’s former chief executive. “Things happen in different directions because decisions are made at different times.”
The added production in Norway comes despite the country’s embrace of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Paris</span> climate agreement, which committed nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Its sovereign wealth fund has cut investments in some oil companies, and its national oil company, Equinor, has pledged to increase its investments in wind power.
Equinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to emphasize its partial pivot to renewable energy, nevertheless defends the new field on its company website, asserting, “The Paris Agreement is quite clear that there will still be a need for oil.”
Norway’s rebound <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 19 years</span> of decline began a few weeks ago as Equinor began production in its Johan Sverdrup deepwater field. The field will eventually <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produce 440,000 barrels</span> a day, increasing the country’s output <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1.3 million</span> barrels a day <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.6 million</span> next year <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.8 million</span> <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021.</span></span>
In Brazil, after years of scandal and delays, new offshore production platforms are coming online. Production has climbed over the last year <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 300,000 barrels</span> a day, and the country is expected to add as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 460,000 more</span> barrels a day by the end <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span> In the coming days, Brazil is scheduled to hold a major auction in which some of the largest oil companies will bid for drilling rights in offshore areas with as much <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 15 billion</span> barrels of reserves.
In Canada, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,000</span>-mile <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Line 3 pipeline</span> that will take oil from the Alberta fields to Wisconsin, is near completion and awaiting final permitting. Energy experts say that could increase Canadian production by a half million barrels a day, or <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span>.
And the most striking change will be in Guyana, a tiny South American country where Exxon Mobil has made a string of major discoveries over the last four years. Production will <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 120,000 barrels</span> a day early next year, rising to at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 750,000 barrels</span> <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025,</span> and more is expected after that.

20435,"<h3>Making Sense of the N.B.A.’s Wacky Start</h3>It has taken an unusual amount of ink, focus, caffeine and pregame napping to stay on top of all the drama in the N.B.A. this season.
Without a running diary, it would be easy to forget that the Oklahoma City Thunder did not win their first game <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 days</span>, or that Blake Griffin <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">scored 50 points</span> against Philadelphia, or that Luke Walton’s run with the Los Angeles Lakers as coach once seemed to be in its final days.
Only a fraction of the way through this season, a crew of New York Times sportswriters and friends are ready to reflect.
Here are their early-season takeaways:
The Celtics were supposed to be better than this
By Sopan Deb
The Boston Celtics could have four first-rounders in next year’s draft, from: the Kings (<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 1 protected</span>), the Grizzlies (1 <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8 protected</span>) and the Clippers (1 <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 14 protected</span>), plus their own. We are almost a quarter of the way through the season. Who would have thought that the Celtics would be on track to end up the highest pick of them all by season’s end?
I’m being hyperbolic. But we’re past the “it’s early” stage to assess the team, and the results are disappointing. Boston lost at home against a terrible Knicks team. Before that, there was a blown double-digit, fourth-quarter lead against a tired Charlotte Hornets team. It’s nothing short of baffling. One of their wins required an unlikely, otherworldly late comeback against an objectively bad Phoenix team. And it’s not like the Celtics are the only team that has had to incorporate players into new roles.
Brad Stevens’s offense moves the ball well (in the top half of the league in assist percentage) and generates open looks with ease. It’s not a lethargy thing, either: The players seem to like playing with one another and for Stevens. And besides, how do you have one of the league’s best defenses without playing hard?
But the open looks just aren’t falling, and neither are the shots around the paint, in the rare instances players actually try to go to the rim. The offense is designed to emphasize the shooting talent of the roster. Everyone has some semblance of a jumper. In today’s N.B.A., this should, in theory, make for a lethal offense. Early on, it was easy to say the bricks were a bug, not a feature. Now you have to wonder if there’s more going on here. Boston shoots <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 35 percent</span> on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, well below the league average.
When the open looks have not fallen, Boston has not found alternatives. The Celtics are near the bottom of the league in drives to the rim per game, which you can get away with if the offense is hitting its jumpers, which it’s not. And when the ball finds its way into the paint, in the restricted area, the Celtics <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shoot 61 percent</span>, also below mediocre.
And then there’s Gordon Hayward, who clearly still needs time. I expected his explosiveness to the rim to need the time, not his 3-point shooting, which is mired <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 28 percent</span>. The lesson: Don’t trust all those off-season workout videos you see of players swishing shots.
So those are the worrying signs. The positives? The talent is there. And this is with Kyrie Irving playing some of the best ball of his career. After a slow start, he is shooting <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 percent</span> from the field and is <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 10 in</span> real plus-minus. Jayson Tatum is pulling out of his slump, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shooting 45 percent</span> from the field in November, compared <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 40 percent</span> in October. You have to believe that Jaylen Brown is better than <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> he is shooting from the field.
Boston has pulled out some big wins against other Eastern Conference powers: Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. I’m still betting on Boston to go to the N.B.A. finals because Stevens is a master at adjustments and, frankly, in this league, talented players in their prime win. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">But if the mediocrity continues, I have to wonder if Danny Ainge will end up regretting not moving more aggressively to trade Brown for Kawhi Leonard.
</span>And the biggest positive: Look at all those draft picks next year, if things don’t work out!
California is once again the wild, wild West
By Scott Cacciola
The N.B.A.’s California contingent has gone mad. The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are dealing with — dare I say it? — some dysfunction. The Los Angeles Lakers and their cast of misfit toys are suddenly surging behind the one and only LeBron James. The Los Angeles Clippers, whom few expected to even vie for a playoff spot, are shaping up as one of the more dangerous teams in the Western Conference. And the Sacramento Kings — well, at least the Kings are still the Kings, reportedly rived by front-office drama.
Out here in California, where I relocated for the season, up is down, left is right and not a whole lot makes sense, starting with the Warriors, whom I visited toward the end of October. At the time, their season was going well, which was no surprise. I wrote about how they were having lots of fun, months removed from a championship season that apparently had its share of behind-the-scenes agita. But they were enjoying themselves again, and get this: Draymond Green said he had made it a goal to stop complaining to the referees so much.
My article did not age well. A kinder, gentler Green proceeded to blow up in Kevin Durant’s face earlier this month, and the fallout has been something to behold. The Warriors have lost a bunch of games. Stephen Curry has been sidelined with an injury. And questions continue to swirl about Durant’s future with the team, with free agency looming this summer.
I think it’s fair to say that no one could have predicted this sort of drama playing out in Oakland. And while I would be shocked to see the Warriors continue to struggle — awesome talent tends to compensate for a multitude of sins — the past couple of weeks have illustrated the fragile nature of team chemistry, even when that team is an established superpower.
Speaking of superpowers, James is doing it again: elevating an odd collection of inexperienced players and reclamation projects into something that resembles a contender, or at least a competitive team. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Not so long ago, Rajon Rondo was trying to deck Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets, and Magic Johnson, the team president, was yelling at Coach Luke Walton, raising concerns about Walton’s job security.</span> But the Lakers now look pretty cohesive compared with the Warriors, and who saw that coming?
James, of course, deserves a lot of the credit. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Approaching 34 and</span> in his 16th season, he is playing some of the finest basketball of his career.
The Clippers, too, have been exciting to watch. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They have ferocious defenders and players who know their roles, and they are going about their business their own way: without a resident superstar, proving there might just be more than one way to win in the modern N.B.A.
Hold off on the hype (i.e., don’t trust the process yet)
</span>By Kevin Draper
It might not work for the Philadelphia 76ers. Jimmy Butler might bolt after the season. He might further erode Markelle Fultz’s confidence. He might not be good enough to be the second-best player on a championship team.
But good for the 76ers for finally pushing their chips into the middle of the table and going for it.
This isn’t an anti-Process rant, or at least not entirely one. It is a plea for a more realistic understanding of the typical development path and of how few young players actually become stars. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Every team eventually has a young player whom fans overhype, who is sure to be a star and whom the team refuses to trade.
</span>For Golden State Warriors fans like me, that player was Anthony Randolph, who promised to be a hybrid of Lamar Odom and Kevin Garnett. In six N.B.A. seasons, Randolph started <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 43 games</span> and <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaged 7.1 points</span>. For Mavericks fans, that player was Rodrigue Beaubois. Declared “untouchable” by Mark Cuban, he lasted four seasons in the league.
Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum — the top three picks in last year’s draft — are all struggling. So is Donovan Mitchell, the rookie of the year runner-up. At the same time, De’Aaron Fox and Zach Collins are impressing after pedestrian rookie seasons.
All of this is to say that young players are tough to evaluate, and the overwhelming majority of them do not become stars. From <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2013 draft</span> there is Giannis Antetokounmpo and maybe Victor Oladipo. <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2014 there</span> is Joel Embiid. <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2015 there</span> are none yet, unless you’re willing to bet the farm on Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis.
If Philadelphia flames out in the playoffs, Butler leaves and Dario Saric turns into a star, the 76ers will look dumb. But the far greater sin is passing on the opportunity to acquire a star in the hope that your young player will develop into one.
Christmas came early this year
By Marc Stein
The cynics will tell you there is little reason to follow the N.B.A. regular season. Not before Christmas, anyway.
As an N.B.A. addict, I love it when the cynics are forced to stuff it.
We’re roughly one-fourth of the way into the 82-game schedule and the Golden State Warriors were on a very mortal 52-win pace entering Friday’s play. They’re hardly running away with things, as so many feared, and there has been a corresponding stream of surprises across the league.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">We might have already seen the biggest in-season blockbuster trade we’re going to get with Jimmy Butler’s Nov.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 move</span> from Minnesota to Philadelphia.</span> We’ve sadly seen Carmelo Anthony’s stint as a Houston Rocket fizzle out faster than could be expected. And we’ve seen an offensive eruption that has quickly generated five 50-point games — and a 60-pointer by Charlotte guard Kemba Walker — after <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 50</span>-point games total last season.
The big-picture geek in me, meanwhile, can’t stop checking the standings every day — even at this early stage — because of the unforeseen chaos in both conferences.
In the resurgent East: Toronto, Milwaukee and Philadelphia are playing better than Boston, which means the Celtics will not be getting that supposed free pass to the N.B.A. finals. The unexpected battle for a top-four seeding — go ahead and throw the pesky Indiana Pacers into the conversation, too — has hushed the notion that this conference should just cease to exist after LeBron James’s relocation to Hollywood.
Out west, meanwhile, Portland, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers are overachieving, thus offsetting the so-so starts endured by the more established likes of Houston, Utah and San Antonio.
The rules haven’t changed; only eight teams in each conference can advance to the playoffs. But take a look at the ever-deep West ladder and you’ll see only one team <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 </span>— Phoenix — that can be dismissed as noncompetitive.
How many wins is it going to take to secure a playoff berth in the West? Are we still sure that LeBron’s Lakers will be one of those eight teams? Does the biggest threat to Golden State’s bid for just the sixth three-peat in N.B.A. history — besides the Warriors themselves — reside in the West or the East?
Maybe we’ll be able to offer a clearer forecast on how to answer these nagging questions when we get to the regular-season midpoint in January.
Then again, given the rampant script defiance we’ve seen throughout #thisleague so far, maybe not.
New rule gives sneakerheads their due
By Kelly Whiteside
When the N.B.A. changed its rule before the season allowing players to wear whatever color shoes they want, sneakerheads rejoiced. Six weeks into the season, this is what that the color change has wrought: In the season opener, Houston Rockets forward P.J. Tucker, the reigning “Sneaker Champ” (there is such a thing), wore three different pairs. One was a black and purple Nike <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kobe 1,</span> which he had signed by Kobe Bryant.
A kaleidoscope of yellow ocher, Cinnamon Toast Crunch (part of Kyrie Irving’s cereal pack) and green Grinch took center stage. Amid this color burst, there were floral patterns from a Chinese line, a pair inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and a shoe featuring a cartoon version of Rosa Parks on its heel — as if we needed more proof that the N.B.A. is much more fun than its stodgy pro counterparts.
Arguably the coolest line of kicks belongs to Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who will wear a different sneaker to every game. For the Nets’ game against the 76ers on Sunday, he will debut his Creed shoe, a nod to Rocky’s roots and the release of the movie “Creed II.”
Dinwiddie unveiled a media shoe, a sneaker close to our heart, in the Nets’ home opener against the Knicks. It thanked news organizations for their hard work. (Really!) It featured the logos of ESPN, NBA TV, Bleacher Report, The New York Post and The New York Times among others.
Against Detroit, he wore the shoes honoring Rosa Park. After the Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee died, Dinwiddie called an audible and helped design a tribute shoe. His brand, K8IROS, has honored other sports and entertainment legends, with sneakers inspired by Colin Kaepernick, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Allen Iverson and Jesse Owens, to be auctioned off for charity.
Signature shoes have long been a benchmark of success in the league, but Dinwiddie thinks what he’s doing — along with the loosened N.B.A. rules — may lead to even more fun on the court. “It would be dope to see everyone try their hand at it and express themselves the way they want to express themselves,” he said."

On one side sits the family of Mallory Beach, a 19-year-old killed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 when</span> a boat driven by Mr. Murdaugh’s late son, Paul, crashed into a bridge to Parris Island. On the other sits Greg Parker, a wealthy convenience store magnate whose company Ms. Beach’s family sued for selling alcohol to an underage Paul before the boat crash.

Mr. Parker denies his company’s culpability in the boat crash, saying the store clerk who sold the alcohol did nothing wrong because Paul Murdaugh presented a valid ID belonging to his older brother.

Mr. Parker, whose Savannah-based Parker’s Kitchen chain <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 71 stores</span> in Georgia and South Carolina, is effectively the last defendant standing as others have settled and the Murdaugh family’s assets are frozen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Under an unusual feature of South Carolina law, that means he could be <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% financially</span> responsible for the girl’s death, with damages potentially running to tens of millions of dollars.

</span>“I’ve <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 47 years</span> trying to create a company that I’m really, really proud of,” Mr. Parker said. He has declared repeatedly that he won’t settle the case, because to settle would be “to have Parker’s name besmirched.”

“That’s what’s wrong with America now,” he said. “People should stand up for what’s right. And I’m standing up for the truth.”

The wrongful-death suit led to a second lawsuit against Mr. Parker personally, accusing him of inflicting intentional emotional distress on the Beach family, which Mr. Parker denies, with an aggressive defense, including a covert investigation into the boat passengers.

The litigation so far hasn’t featured in the lurid headlines associated with the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, which took place at the family’s hunting estate near Hampton, S.C., in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2021.</span> But it has become the poster child for tort reform in a lobbying campaign underwritten by Mr. Parker, who has staked much of his reputation and personal fortune on the case. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">His goal is to change the way financial damages in certain lawsuits in South Carolina are awarded.

</span>The Beach litigation has also had its fantastical twists, with accusations that Mr. Parker’s team improperly plied a boat passenger’s underage friend with alcohol for information, an effort to have Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley removed from both cases and an appeal to the state supreme court to claw back from Mr. <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Tinsley 5,600 pages</span> of formerly private correspondence between Mr. Parker’s team and a crisis communications firm.

Mr. Tinsley, a personal-injury lawyer in Allendale, S.C., said he wants to take Mr. Parker “for everything he’s got” because the case has become personal. Mr. Tinsley said he is offended by the lengths to which Mr. Parker’s team has gone in the continuing investigation, which has made an excruciating situation for the Beaches even worse.

“I can prove everything he did and I’m going to, and he’s going to write me a big check,” Mr. Tinsley said.

Power in county

The boat crash in many ways began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The wrongful-death suit began bringing out financial information that spiraled into an inquiry into Alex Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing.

</span>Mr. Murdaugh was the fourth-generation scion of a family that ran the solicitor’s, or district attorney’s, office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit in southeastern South Carolina for nearly a century, while also running a dominant personal-injury firm.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, known as SLED, has taken over Murdaugh-related investigations, given the family’s close working relationship with local law enforcement.

Before he was accused in the double homicide of his wife and son last month, Mr. Murdaugh faced more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 felony</span> counts in what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to defraud his personal-injury clients <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $8.5 million</span>. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He has been jailed since October, weeks after he was charged with insurance fraud in a failed assisted-suicide attempt in a roadside shooting last Labor Day weekend.</span> He has pleaded not guilty to most of the fraud and other counts against him, in addition to the murder charges.

Based on information uncovered in the double-homicide investigation, SLED is looking into two other suspicious deaths: that of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old classmate of Mr. Murdaugh’s older son whose body was found on a country road in 2015; and Gloria Satterfield, the 57-year-old family housekeeper who died after falling down the front steps at the Murdaugh home <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span>

In the days before the killing of his wife and son on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 7,</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Murdaugh was under immense pressure in the boat-crash wrongful-death case. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A judge had scheduled a hearing for <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 10 to</span> consider a motion by Mr. Tinsley to compel Mr. Murdaugh to turn over his financial information, which had been requested eight months earlier and was part of the wrangling over Mr. Murdaugh’s insurance coverage and ability to pay potential damages.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The state’s chief prosecutor last month said the evidence collected while investigating the alleged financial crimes provides “the background and the motive” for the double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said it is surreal to be wrapped up in the Murdaugh morass and offensive to be accused in the death of Mallory Beach. “It’s an incredible tragedy,” he said. “But we’re not responsible.”

Mr. Tinsley said in court filings that Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for the crash because the clerk made an obvious mistake when checking the ID Paul Murdaugh handed her when buying the alcohol. The clerk should have noticed that Paul’s slight build didn’t match up with the height and weight listed on his big brother’s ID, said Mr. Tinsley.

“When you stress the speed of the transaction such that the people don’t even read the information on the ID, it’s apparent what’s going to happen,” Mr. Tinsley said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said Mr. Parker knows that state law and store policy on alcohol sales aren’t rigorously followed at Parker’s Kitchen stores, a claim Mr. Parker denies.

</span>Night of drinking

The fatal boat crash happened in the foggy, early morning hours of Feb.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span>

Paul Murdaugh started the prior evening by buying alcohol at a Parker’s Kitchen in Ridgeland, S.C., according to files released by state investigators. The store is a few miles from his grandfather Randolph Murdaugh III’s fishing cabin, where Paul, his then-girlfriend Morgan Doughty and two other couples planned to spend the night, according to the files.

Video footage shows Paul circling the interior of the store, selecting his purchases and approaching the checkout counter. He <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 19 at</span> the time, but he hands clerk Tajeeha Cohen a driver’s license belonging to his brother, Richard Alexander “Buster” Murdaugh Jr., who was <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 22.</span> Ms. Cohen appears to look at the license and at Paul and uses a scanner to verify the validity of the license before ringing up the sale of beer, hard seltzer, gum and cigarettes <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $49 on</span> his mother’s credit card.

After Paul walks out of the store, he hoists his purchases over his head in a gesture to friends by his truck, according to the footage.

The six young people met at Paul’s grandfather’s Chechessee River house around 6:30 p.m., according to court documents. They took the boat to an oyster roast—a tradition in the South Carolina lowcountry—at another home on the water. They stayed at the party about four hours, and all were drinking while underage, according to depositions and investigative records.

On the ride home, passengers took turns holding a flashlight to maneuver the waterways because the boat didn’t have running lights. Just <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 1 a</span>.m., Paul docked the boat in downtown Beaufort, where he and fellow boat passenger Connor Cook had two rounds of liquor shots.

Several passengers later testified that Paul drove the boat except for when Mr. Cook took the wheel while Paul went to the bow to confront Ms. Doughty. She told police he spit on her and slapped her, “screaming, cussing and saying horrible things,” according to court documents.

At 2:20 a.m., GPS data show the boat accelerated rapidly and slammed into the pilings by the bridge to Parris Island, which was on the route back to the Murdaugh cabin, investigative reports said. Three of the passengers were thrown into the water, including Ms. Beach, who couldn’t be found. Paul, Ms. Doughty and Mr. Cook were taken by ambulances to the hospital.

It took a week to find Ms. Beach’s body, which was facedown in the <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">marsh 5 miles</span> north of the bridge.

Paul’s blood drawn as part of his care at the hospital showed that his blood-alcohol level <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was .286,</span> according to hospital records, three times the legal limit in South Carolina. Paul was criminally charged in <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2019,</span> including boating under the influence causing death, but the charges were dropped after his death last June, leaving the wrongful-death suit the key legal proceeding.

Mr. Tinsley filed suit on behalf of Mallory’s mother, Renee Beach, on <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019.</span></span> The defendants included Alex Murdaugh, who owned the boat; Buster Murdaugh; Randolph Murdaugh III; an elementary school assistant principal and her husband who hosted the oyster roast; the owner of the bar where Paul took shots; and Gregory M. Parker Inc., Mr. Parker’s company.

The hosts of the oyster roast, the bar owner and Randolph Murdaugh III, who died of cancer in<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> and their insurers settled with Ms. Beach within weeks of the suit being filed. Those settlements <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaled $1.7 million</span>, according to court filings.

Alex and Buster Murdaugh remain defendants. They have both denied responsibility in Ms. Beach’s death, and have argued their assets are inadequate to pay any potential damages.

That left the Parker company, as the defendant with assets, as the focus of the lawsuit.

The wrongful-death trial could start as soon as November in the Hampton County Courthouse, where Alex Murdaugh was long a regular presence and where the walls are lined with portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.

Quirk in liability law

Mr. Parker,<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 68,</span> built his company from one gas station in rural Georgia <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1976 to</span> a popular chain that prides itself on hand-breaded chicken fingers, clean restrooms and “Chewy Ice,” which Mr. Parker says is his own invention, born of a love of soft and crunchy ice pellets.

As Mr. Parker talked about Paul Murdaugh’s transaction, he pulled a worn printout from a stack of papers. It was an image of Alex, Maggie, Buster and Paul Murdaugh courtside at a University of South Carolina basketball game, posted on Maggie Murdaugh’s Facebook two weeks before the crash. Both brothers have red hair and fair skin.

Ms. Cohen “takes the driver’s license,” Mr. Parker said. “She looks at it. Well, guess what? They look alike.” Passengers on the boat testified in depositions that Paul frequently used his brother’s ID, including the night of the crash at the bar in Beaufort.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In court filings, Mr. Tinsley said Mr. Parker’s company shares responsibility for Ms. Beach’s death because of a companywide focus on the speed of transactions, which creates room for error in alcohol sales.</span> Mr. Tinsley also said Ms. Cohen lacked training, failed to notice the differences in height and weight between Paul Murdaugh and the ID he used and didn’t follow other company policies.

“They’ve got great written policies,” Mr. Tinsley said. “If they did what they said they were going to do, I don’t think this happens.”

Mr. Parker said he has never reprimanded anyone over the speed they handle transactions and that Ms. Cohen was properly trained.

Ms. Cohen isn’t named as a defendant in the Beach wrongful-death suit, though she is named as a defendant in two personal-injury suits brought by other passengers. Her lawyer declined a request for an interview on her behalf.

Alcohol-enforcement authorities haven’t cited Ms. Cohen or the company in the sale, Mr. Parker said. An agent with SLED testified that she reviewed the video footage and found that Ms. Cohen “did her due diligence,” by asking for the ID and scanning it to verify its validity, according to court records. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">State law doesn’t require checking the height and weight on an ID in alcohol sales.

</span>South Carolina law allows a plaintiff in an alcohol-related case to choose to <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collect 100% of</span> the damages from a bar, store owner or host if a jury finds that entity the slightest amount at fault. The law, known as a joint-and-several liability law, differs from that in most other states, including Georgia, where a defendant pays a share of damages based on a percentage of fault assigned by a jury.

“You say ‘Well, wait a minute. If I’m one-millionth <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1% responsible</span>, I can be <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">held 100% liable</span>?’ ” said Mr. Parker, in a recent interview. “How does that work? That’s not fair.” He is lobbying the state legislature to change the law.

The law was designed to make sure a plaintiff could collect the full amount awarded by a jury, Mr. Tinsley said, adding it originated when bars commonly operated without liquor liability insurance.

In December<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> Mr. Tinsley filed the second suit on behalf of the Beach family against Mr. Parker personally and some of the lawyers and investigators working on his defense team, alleging civil conspiracy and outrage, or the intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Mr. Tinsley alleges in the lawsuit Mr. Parker’s team planted negative information online about Ms. Beach, which Mr. Parker denies.

Mr. Tinsley said in a March court hearing that Mr. Parker’s team also hired private investigator Sara Capelli to follow Paul in the months before his death. He said at the hearing Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for a friend of one of the boat passengers when she was underage in an attempt to get information about Paul. Mr. Tinsley showed the judge a copy of a February photo taken of the young woman and Ms. Capelli at a Super Bowl party in a Columbia, S.C., bar.

Super Bowl party

Rhett Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Ms. Capelli had a contract to follow Paul in <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021 with</span> a law firm representing Mr. Parker. Mr. Klok said as part of her work, Ms. Capelli went to the private Super Bowl party, which was sponsored by Kappa Alpha Order, the college fraternity that has counted several Murdaughs as members, including Alex and Buster.

When asked whether Ms. Capelli bought alcohol for anyone underage, Mr. Klok said, “Not that she knows of.” He added, “They had electronic carding at the door. She assumed everyone was an adult.”

Mr. Parker said he can’t comment on specific allegations because he is a defendant in the case. But he said “we sure as heck wouldn’t have directed anybody to break the law,” including by buying alcohol for someone underage.

Mr. Tinsley said many of the materials sought in Mr. Parker’s investigation wouldn’t be admissible in court because footage or photos of Paul drinking excessively or underage in other settings wasn’t the cause of the boat crash. “There’s only one conclusion,” he said in an interview. Mr. Parker’s side was “collecting it to make [others] look bad in the public arena.”

A lawyer for Mr. Parker in the wrongful-death case said he expects the material to be admissible because it establishes a propensity for excessive drinking.

The suit also alleges that Mr. Parker’s team leaked law-enforcement photos of Ms. Beach’s dead body and a confidential video that was part of shared materials in the lawsuit, meant to be used only in the court proceedings, to a documentary filmmaker.

Mr. Tinsley said he created the video and shared it with Mr. Parker’s lawyers to demonstrate how he might humanize Ms. Beach to a jury. It included home movies, still photographs and interviews with family members.

The suit alleges that six snippets from the confidential video appeared last November in an online trailer for “Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,” a documentary by Vicky Ward, who is also named as a defendant in the outrage suit.

Ms. Ward said in court filings that she came into possession of the video before contacting Mr. Tinsley to request an interview with the Beach family last September. She said in a court filing that Mr. Tinsley told her that “whoever provided the video to her violated the mediation rules” and that Mr. Tinsley gave her permission to use the video.

Mr. Tinsley denies that, and said Ms. Ward didn’t seek the family’s written approval to use their material, which he said was standard practice in documentary production.

In December, she said in a written statement to FITSNews.com, an online outlet covering the Murdaugh saga, that the trailer was for internal use at her production company and was posted in error.

Edward Fenno, Ms. Ward’s media lawyer, declined a request to interview Ms. Ward. In May, a judge denied Ms. Ward’s motion to be dismissed from the case. Mr. Fenno said she looks forward to asserting her journalistic rights to receive and publish information in further filings or at trial.

The completed “Murdaugh Murders” documentary began streaming in June on the Investigation Discovery network, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The documentary didn’t include the snippets from the confidential mediation video; it did include a blurred image of Ms. Beach’s dead body and several Snapchat videos taken by the passengers on the boat that Mr. Tinsley said law enforcement provided to him and to the Parker’s legal team but haven’t made public.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said a large team has been employed on his behalf by his lawyers.</span> The team has included private investigators, investigative journalists, social-media strategists, opposition researchers and crisis managers. At <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 18 lawyers</span> have been listed in court filings as representing Mr. Parker or his company.

“We were trying to find out who and what we were up against,” Mr. Parker said.

Mr. Parker said he didn’t personally know or direct the actions of each person working on his behalf, but he didn’t authorize anyone to leak photos of Ms. Beach’s body or cause distress to the Beaches. He alleged Mr. Tinsley leaked the mediation video, which Mr. Tinsley denies.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Parker said an investigative firm digging into the Murdaughs on Mr. Parker’s behalf hired investigative journalist Gregg Roman and two private investigators, Max Fratoddi and Henry Rosado.

Mr. Roman published <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7,000</span>-word investigation on the Murdaughs on his blog last summer; he also appeared in and co-produced Ms. Ward’s documentary. Mr. Parker’s spokeswoman said Mr. Roman’s contract ended well before the double homicide and no one affiliated with the Parker’s team authorized his blog post or participation in the documentary. Mr. Roman said his written and documentary work were independent of the research he was paid to conduct.

Mr. Fratoddi and Mr. Rosado, who are defendants in the outrage case, said in court filings that they were “engaged to gather information for news purposes” and not part of a conspiracy.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his team pieced together details about Alex Murdaugh’s family financial holdings, including allegations of questionable property exchanges and suspicions related to the deaths of Mr. Smith, the classmate of Buster Murdaugh, and Ms. Satterfield, the housekeeper, before last summer’s double homicide.

</span>Mr. Parker said he hired people he described as investigative journalists because he was shocked at the incestuousness of the South Carolina legal system, including the scope of the Murdaugh family’s influence.

“When I look back on this [investigation], do I think ‘Oh, gosh, I wish I hadn’t have done that?’ ” Mr. Parker said. “Absolutely not. I’m proud of the work we did.”

When asked whether he conducted a stealth investigation and what specifically it entailed, Mr. Parker paused. “Here’s a better question,” he said. “ ‘So what?’ Of course I did. Anybody in my situation would have done exactly the same thing.”

As to whether it was appropriate to surveil Paul Murdaugh, the son of a co-defendant in the wrongful-death case, Mr. Parker said he wanted to get pictures of Paul drinking, “which was pretty easy to do.” He added: “This life of privilege is part of what should be examined here.”

Mr. Parker said the outrage suit is a tactic to pressure him to settle. He recently rejected an offer to settle the wrongful-death case <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $25 million</span>, according to a person familiar with the settlement talks.

The outrage suit is in limbo temporarily as the state supreme court considers a request by Mr. Parker’s team to force Mr. Tinsley to return documents the team says are covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Parker’s lawyers say <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 5,600 documents</span> were provided to Mr. Tinsley prematurely by Wesley Donehue, who runs the Push Digital strategy group, and the Laurens Group, a crisis-communications firm.

Mr. Donehue’s lawyer, Sandy Senn, who is also a state senator, declined an interview request on behalf of her client, who stopped working with Parker’s team in the spring <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span> “Mr. Parker’s lawyers are aggressive, threatening and litigious,” Ms. Senn said in an email. “I hope you understand that what is best for my client is to stay away from this...case.”

Mr. Parker’s lawyers also filed a motion to force Mr. Tinsley to turn over any emails and texts exchanged with Ms. Capelli, the private investigator working for Mr. Parker. The lawyers submitted as <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">evidence 145 text</span> messages between Mr. Tinsley and Ms. Capelli, arguing that Mr. Tinsley violated the rules of professional conduct by engaging with Ms. Capelli.

Mr. Tinsley said he acted appropriately in his communications with members of Mr. Parker’s team, including Ms. Capelli, who he said initiated contact by sending him a Facebook friend request earlier this year. Mr. Klok, Ms. Capelli’s lawyer, said Mr. Tinsley was wrong to engage with Ms. Capelli when he knew she was represented by counsel.

Layers of connections

Some of the players in the Murdaugh morass have intertwined relationships in South Carolina’s close-knit legal community.

Mr. Tinsley,<span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 51,</span> is a partner at Gooding & Gooding, a three-lawyer practice in Allendale County, S.C., which is adjacent to Hampton County. He was co-counsel in <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2018 case</span> that netted <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10.5 million</span> settlement against a methadone clinic, where the lead counsel was Dick Harpootlian, a state senator who is now Alex Murdaugh’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Harpootlian is also a Democratic power broker; his wife, Jamie, is President Biden’s ambassador to Slovenia.

Mr. Tinsley has frequently worked alongside the Murdaugh family firm, which changed its name last January to the Parker Law Group—unrelated to Mr. Parker—including with a lawyer from the firm in a record-<span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">setting $30 million</span> jury award against Ford Motor Co.

Mr. Parker’s team includes some of the state’s best-known lawyers, including Murrell Smith, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, and Deborah Barbier, a former federal prosecutor who briefly co-led former President Donald Trump’s defense team on his second impeachment. She was also a sorority sister of Maggie Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina and classmate of Alex Murdaugh at the University of South Carolina School of Law.

Mr. Parker’s company is also separately being sued by the surviving boat passengers: Ms. Doughty, whose hand was injured; Mr. Cook, whose jaw was broken; Miley Altman, Mr. Cook’s girlfriend; and Anthony Cook, Ms. Beach’s boyfriend and Mr. Cook’s cousin. Each said they suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the crash and the death of Ms. Beach.

In a preview of Mr. Parker’s defense in the wrongful-death suit, his lead trial lawyer, Pankaj “P.K.” Shere of Raleigh, N.C., said he anticipates asking jurors to apply common sense and consider whether a two-minute transaction at Parker’s nine hours before the crash was the fundamental reason for Ms. Beach’s death. He will also ask them to consider whether the six-pack of Michelob Ultra Lime light beer, 15-pack of Natural Light beer and 12-pack of White Claw hard seltzer Paul Murdaugh purchased was sufficient to make him so grossly intoxicated, even if he drank it all himself, which he didn’t, according to depositions.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Parker said his defense will also assert that the young people on the boat could have done more than he or his employees to prevent the crash, including physically blocking Paul Murdaugh from driving.

</span>Mr. Parker said he is particularly galled by Connor Cook’s lawsuit. “He said I’m responsible for the accident? He was buying him glass-fulls of Jägermeister [at the bar] before the incident, and I’m responsible?”

Joe McCulloch, Mr. Cook’s lawyer, said Mr. Cook and the other passengers said in witness statements and depositions that they tried to persuade Paul not to drive. But he said it is unrealistic to say Mr. Cook or any of the passengers should have wrestled the wheel from an erratic Paul Murdaugh, who had stripped down to his boxers and was gesticulating wildly, according to depositions. “Mutiny on the Bounty wouldn’t have ended well for anybody,” Mr. McCulloch said.

South Carolina law has strict liability for the sale of alcohol to someone underage, meaning a person is responsible even if they didn’t know what they did was wrong, Mr. McCulloch said. “Very few defendants in tragedies of this type are willing to accept responsibility,” Mr. McCulloch said. “His willingness to point the finger isn’t surprising.”

Mr. Parker said he has aggressive growth plans to double the number of Parker’s Kitchen stores over the next four years, with much of that growth in South Carolina, which is part of the reason he is lobbying legislators to change the joint-and-several liability law in alcohol-related cases.

19694,"<h3>3-D Printer Makers Get Reality Check</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Toughest Job for ExOne's President: Managing the Hype

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 4,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 8</span>:07 pm ET

IRWIN, Pa.—One of the biggest jobs facing ExOne Co. XONE -0.04%decrease; red down pointing triangle President David Burns and the heady 3-D printing industry is managing expectations, including his own.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last year, Mr. Burns predicted <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 80% increase</span> in sales for ExOne, which makes 3-D printers.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Then in January, ExOne said sales growth, while strong, would be about half that amount due to deferred orders.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">ExOne's stock has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 46% since</span>.

</span>""That was a mistake to have been that aggressive,"" said Mr. Burns, who remains optimistic.

Patience and potential are often at odds in 3-D manufacturing, a potentially transformative process that allows complex and precision manufacturing while bypassing certain production steps.

The process involves taking a digital image of an object and slicing it into thousands of layers. The image is then transferred to a printer, which creates a three-dimensional object by producing each layer in plastic, metal, sand or other materials.

Retailers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sell $1,500 3</span>-D printers that can make toys and jewelry. More advanced printers, selling <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $500,000 each</span>, make metal pump parts for the U.S. Navy, titanium knee joints and plastic ear pieces for hearing aids. Ford Motor Co. engineers use 3-D printers to make some prototype parts.

""Every week, if not every day, somebody walks into my office and says: 'You should be 3-D printing this out of that material,"" said Mr. Burns, a Rochester, N.Y., native, who managed machine shops before helping launch ExOne <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005 here</span> in western Pennsylvania. ""It's easy to get distracted.<span id=""4"" class=""red"">""

Stock prices for some 3-D printing companies more than doubled <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> while world-wide revenue increased a <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">smaller 27% to</span> an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $2.8 billion</span> last year, according to consultancy Wohlers Associates Inc. in Colorado.</span> 3-D stocks though are off to a rough start this year with industry leaders 3D Systems Corp. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">DDD 1.66</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 40% and</span> Stratasys Ltd. SSYS -1.48%decrease; red down pointing triangle off <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 19% since</span> the start <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014.</span>

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Still, some 3-D stocks remain priced <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 50 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70 times</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">projected 2014 earnings</span>, attracting comparisons to the overheated market for Internet stocks during the early 2000s.</span> ExOne shares are <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 42% since</span> going public in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2013,</span> but <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">off 53% from</span> its August high.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">3-D is ""overhyped"" and that's reflected in the stock prices, said Weston Twigg, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities.</span> ""What the technology can do today is interesting. But the printers aren't yet capable of an industrial revolution.""

He and other analysts say the printers need to be faster and cheaper to replace traditional techniques that cut, stamp, grind or cast metal into finished objects.

The biggest current advantage of 3-D printers: flexibility and complexity. ExOne's printers made a pump impeller for the Navy as a single unit, the company said. Before, it was assembled <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 13 parts</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">ExOne is pursuing a risky industrial-only strategy focused on making metal objects—no plastic—in a bet that it will dominate a market for metal printers that is still in its infancy.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">""They've got an attractive position in the [metal printer] market, but the question is will metals be an attractive market to have an attractive position in,"" said Holden Lewis, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets.

</span>Although ExOne does have some big customers, including Caterpillar Inc. and United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky helicopter unit.<span id=""9"" class=""red"">, its sales last year <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were $39.5 million</span>, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 38% increase</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2012.</span></span> Heavy expenses for production and technology development contributed to <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $6.5 million</span> loss last year, an improvement from <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10.2 million</span> loss <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The company'<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $500 million</span> market capitalization is dwarfed by <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5.7 billion</span> market cap for bigger rivals 3-D Systems <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $5.4 billion</span> for Stratasys.

</span>ExOne printers use silica sand for creating molds for metal castings or powdered metal, such as stainless steel or bronze, that are mixed with a glue-type binder to hold the particles together. The printer applies layer after layer during hours of production work. Once printed, the metal object goes into <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2,300</span>-degree furnace where metal particles are melted together.

Ford uses ExOne printers in design centers in North America and Europe to make molds for prototype engine and transmission parts, including the engine block for Ford's popular EcoBoost engine. It takes four days and <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $3,000 to</span> print a 3-D prototype of an engine's air intake manifold, compared to four months <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $500,000 without</span> 3-D printing. Prototyped parts with 3-D printing can be easily enlarged or reduced by fractions of an inch and printed again.

""You're offering engineers a lot more flexibility"" with their component designs, said Harold Sears, additive manufacturing specialist at Ford. Printers can't yet produce finished parts in large enough volumes to install in cars and light trucks.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">3-D is making inroads in the market for hard-to-find replacement parts.</span> Contract manufacturer rp+m in Avon Lake, Ohio, uses an ExOne printer to make replacement parts from powdered tungsten for medical-imaging machines built by General Electric Co., Siemens AG and Philips NV. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">In many cases, the original suppliers have gone out of business and replacements parts must be built from scratch, usually in small quantities.

</span>""Companies order exactly what they need,"" said Matt Hlavin, chief executive of rp+m, which <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 13 3</span>-D printers made by multiple companies.

Some 3-D customers want printed parts but aren't ready to invest in the printers themselves. Hydro Parts Solutions Inc. makes replacement parts for pumps and other equipment at oil refineries and chemical plants. ""The pumps are so old that no one has replacement parts for them,"" said co-owner Jeff Smith.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">His engineers create digital images of the broken or worn part and send it electronically to one of ExOne's seven job shops.</span> There, the printer creates a mold, which has as many <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 11,000 layers</span>, in less <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 24 hours</span>. The mold is used to cast a new metal part. In the past, this process took more than six weeks and the resulting molds weren't as precise and detailed.

""You can control the shape much better with 3-D,"" said Mr. Smith who ran a foundry <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20 years</span> before launching Hydro Parts.

Political risk is deterring some investors from making big bets on eurozone stocks
Politics have been a major risk for European investors over the past several years.</span> The U.K.’s coming vote on whether it should leave the European Union <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">means 2016 will</span> be no different.
Uncertainty over the outcome of the bitterly contested <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 referendum</span> has investors on edge. That unease is showing up in swooning sterling markets, weakness in U.K-focused stocks and a slowdown in companies raising money in capital markets.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The uncertainty also is deterring some investors from making big bets on eurozone stocks, as many remain cautious about the potential impact of a British exit, or “Brexit,” on the rest of the trading bloc.
</span>“When we talk to companies, one of our first questions now is what plans are they making for a Brexit,” said Alan Custis, head of U.K. equities at Lazard Asset Management.
Opinion polls have narrowed in recent weeks but still suggest Britons will vote to remain in the EU. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Investors are bracing for market volatility, which they expect to rise as the vote approaches.</span> Many investors have scaled back bets on small, domestically oriented U.K. companies, which they view as likely to suffer the most in the immediate aftermath of a Brexit.
Lazard, for example, has moved into more internationally diverse U.K. businesses, such as food and tobacco companies, which the firm believes should be comparatively insulated.
London’s FTSE <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">AIM 100 index</span>, composed of small-cap companies, has <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 5.2% this</span> year, while the large-cap <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">FTSE 100 index</span> is <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 1.1%.</span>
A British exit also could boost euroskeptic parties across Europe, possibly encouraging other nations, such as the Netherlands, to leave the EU, according to strategists.
“The impact [of Brexit] on Europe could be more lasting,” said Luca Simoncelli, investment manager at Switzerland-based Unigestion, who has trimmed his exposure to euro-area equities.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The possibility of Brexit has been even more pronounced in currency markets.</span> Investor selling has pushed the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pound 2.5% lower</span> against the U.S. dollar and <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 7% lower</span> against the euro since the start of the year.
Many investors have turned to options markets to guard against a potential sharp fall in the pound following the vote. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The implied volatility of three-month currency options on the pound-dollar exchange rate—which is closely linked to the price of such contracts—is hovering at nearly a six-year high of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 15%,</span> according to Thomson Reuters.</span> That is up from <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 8% in</span> early January.
“The general consensus is that in the very near term a vote to leave would create a fair degree of volatility, and people want to do something to hedge,” said Daniel Loughney, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.
Some believe the euro could be impacted, too. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Brexit-related uncertainty will not only affect the U.K, but the eurozone, said currency strategists at Bank of America Corp. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">BAC 0.30 </span>% , who suggested shorting the euro as a hedge.
</span>U.K. government bonds, usually viewed as a haven asset, haven’t been immune from anticipation of Brexit, either. In January, foreign investors reduced their exposure to U.K. gilts by £6.3 billion ($9 billion), the biggest monthly fall in nearly two years, according to the Bank of England.
Still, yields on 10-year gilts are down by more than half a percentage point this year, as domestic buying has more than offset this outflow so far. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Yields fall as prices rise.

There are signs that the coming vote has cast a chill over capital markets as well. Equity bankers say U.K. initial public offerings, which have been depressed across developed markets, have taken a knock due to the referendum. Year-to-date IPO volume in the U.K. is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $2.1 billion</span>, compared <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $4.9 billion</span> for the same period last year, according to data provider Dealogic.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Brexit could create question marks around economic growth and currencies, and both are relevant to many IPO stories,” said Jasper Tans, co-head of Europe, Middle East and Africa equity capital markets at UBS.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, sales of new sterling-denominated corporate bonds have had their the slowest start to a year <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2003,</span> according to Dealogic.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Sterling corporate bonds also have been underperforming in secondary markets relative to euro-denominated debt, according to Barclays’s bond indexes.
</span>Investors have become particularly wary of U.K. bank bonds, said Nicolas Trindade, a portfolio manager at Axa Investment Managers.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The vote “is definitely one of the reasons why we may have seen the sterling market underperform,” said Mr. Trindade.
</span>To be sure, investors say the vote also is providing moneymaking opportunities. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Betting against the pound was a profitable trade for many in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016.</span></span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The weaker currency has also been a boon for U.K. companies that sell the bulk of their goods abroad, as it makes their products more competitive there.
</span>British American Tobacco BTI -0.50 % PLC, for example, is one company that benefits from a falling pound, said Carl Auffret, a portfolio manager at DNCA Investments.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Currency moves <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">knocked 6.2% off</span> the company’s earnings <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 as</span> the pound on average gained against the currencies of the U.K.’s trading partners.</span> This year, as the pound has fallen, shares in British American Tobacco are <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.8%.</span>
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Companies with a large cost base in pounds and revenues in other currencies will be the winners, said Mr. Auffret.

63507,"<h3>As China Talks Begin, Trump’s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering</h3>WASHINGTON — <span id=""0"" class=""red"">In the middle of his crowded dinner in Buenos Aires with President Xi Jinping of China, President Trump leaned across the table, pointed to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative whose skepticism of China runs deep, and declared, “That’s my negotiator!”
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">He then turned to Peter Navarro, his even more hawkish trade adviser, adding, “And that’s my tough guy!”</span> according to aides with knowledge of the exchange.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Now, with talks between China and the United States set to begin this week in Beijing, Mr. Lighthizer, aided by Mr. Navarro, faces the assignment of a lifetime: redefining the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies by Mr. Trump’s <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2 deadline</span> to reach an agreement.
</span>And he must do it in a way that tilts the balance of power toward the United States. His approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">First, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Despite his declaration that trade wars are “easy to win” and his recent boast that he is a “Tariff Man,” Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.
</span>Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his advisers that Mr. Xi is someone with whom he can cut a big deal, according to people who have spoken with the president. On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi to discuss the status of talks, tweeting afterward that good progress was being made. “Deal is moving along very well,” Mr. Trump said.
The administration has tried to force China to change its ways with stiff tariffs <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $250 billion</span> worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and threats of additional levies on <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $267 billion</span> worth of goods. China has responded with its own tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods. But over a steak dinner during the Group <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 summit</span> meeting in Argentina, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump agreed to a 90-day truce and to work toward an agreement that Mr. Trump said could lead to “one of the largest deals ever made.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“It’s not some subtle shift; Trump has flipped since September,” said Derek Scissors, who studies China’s economy for the American Enterprise Institute.</span> “He went from saying how he was going to slap tariffs on everything to all this talk about making the greatest deal ever.”
Mr. Lighthizer — whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February — has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting “empty promises” like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Lighthizer,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 71,</span> is pushing for substantive changes, such as forcing China to end its practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.</span> But <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 40 years</span> of dealing with China and watching it dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs in order to win true concessions.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">When Mr. Lighthizer senses that anyone — even Mr. Trump — might be going a little soft on China, he opens a paper-clipped manila folder he totes around and brandishes a single-page, easy-reading chart that lists decades of failed trade negotiations with Beijing, according to administration officials.
</span>“Bob’s attitude toward China is very simple. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He wants them to surrender,” said William A. Reinsch, a former federal trade official who met him three decades ago when Mr. Lighthizer was a young aide for former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.</span> “His negotiating strategy is simple too. He basically gives them a list of things he wants them to do and says, ‘Fix it now.’”
Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Lighthizer last month to lead the talks initially spooked markets, which viewed the China skeptic’s appointment as an ominous sign. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It also annoyed Chinese officials, who had been talking with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a more moderate voice on trade and the primary point of contact for Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Mnuchin has urged the president to avoid a protracted trade war, even if that entails reaching an interim agreement that leaves some issues unresolved.
</span>Mr. Mnuchin, who attended the G-20 dinner, helped Mr. Trump craft an upbeat assessment declaring the Buenos Aires meeting “highly successful” in the presidential limousine back to the airport, according to a senior administration official.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The disparate views among Mr. Trump’s top trade advisers have prompted sparring — both publicly and behind the scenes.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">In <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2017,</span> when Mr. Lighthizer grew concerned that Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, were wading too far into China matters, he enlisted Rob Porter, the president’s staff secretary at the time, to persuade Mr. Trump to draft a document designating Mr. Lighthizer the main trade emissary to China, according to a person who has seen the letter.</span> Mr. Lighthizer has never used the document to defend his position, the person said, but he considers it an insurance policy of sorts.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">During an Oval Office meeting with the trade team the fall <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017,</span> Mr. Lighthizer accused Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the former National Economic Council director, of bad-mouthing him to free-trade Republican senators.
</span>The argument grew so heated that the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, quickly pulled the combatants into the nearby Roosevelt Room and away from the president, where the argument raged on for a few more minutes, according to two witnesses.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, disputed the account.
</span>Mr. Lighthizer has since worked to increase his own face time with Mr. Trump. He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president’s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer’s <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own $2.3 million</span> waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.
He used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China’s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing’s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.
“Good luck with that,” Mr. Scissors said.
Those who know Mr. Lighthizer say he will try to force concessions through a combination of pressure tactics, like tariffs, and public condemnation. Mr. Lighthizer — who described his own negotiating style as “knowing where the leverage is” during <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1984 interview</span> — typically presents few specific demands during initial talks while publicly bashing efforts by the other side.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He used that approach during recent talks with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, criticizing foreign counterparts as intransigent and characterizing complaints by American businesses as pure greed.
</span>Mr. Lighthizer’s unsparing view of China comes, in part, from his childhood in Ashtabula, Ohio, an industrial and shipping town on the Great Lakes hit by the offshoring of steel and chemical production. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">For much of his career, Mr. Lighthizer was a lonely protectionist voice in a Republican Party dominated by free traders, alternating between jobs in government and a lucrative private law career representing large American corporations like United States Steel in trade cases against China.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Mr. Lighthizer found his way into Mr. Trump’s orbit through his work in the steel industry, where he gained prominence by filing lawsuits accusing Japan and China of dumping metals into the United States, in violation of trade laws.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> Mr. Lighthizer caught Mr. Trump’s eye with an opinion piece in The Washington Times, in which he defended Mr. Trump’s approach to China as consistent with conservative ideology and compared the future president to Republican icons like Ronald Reagan.
Taciturn in public and self-deprecating in private, Mr. Lighthizer sees himself as a serious player on the world stage: Two recent guests to Mr. Lighthizer’s Georgetown townhouse were greeted by the stern visage of their host staring down at them from an oil portrait on the wall.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">The trade adviser is guarded around Mr. Trump, often waiting until the end of meetings to make his points and quietly nudging the president away from actions he views as counterproductive, current and former officials said.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">That was the case in mid-2017 when he cautioned the president against withdrawing unilaterally from the World Trade Organization, adding for emphasis, “And I hate the W.T.O. as much as anybody.”
</span>He does not always get his way. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">In the wake of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this fall, Mr. Lighthizer urged Mr. Trump to consider easing steel and aluminum tariffs on those countries and replacing them with less burdensome quotas.</span> Mr. Trump rejected his plan, according to negotiators from all three countries.
A poker-faced Mr. Lighthizer broke the news to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts by declaring the proposal was inoperative, one of the officials said.
The president also ignored Mr. Lighthizer’s advice in early December when he announced that he intended to begin the six-month process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta in order to pressure House Democrats into passing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">That threat undermined months of quiet negotiations between Mr. Lighthizer, labor groups and Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to try to win their support for the new trade deal.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump has yet to follow through on his threat, and Mr. Lighthizer continues trying to work with Democrats to get the new trade deal approved.
</span>“Bob is trying to provide stability and focus in a completely chaotic environment,” Mr. Brown said. “I can’t speak for Bob, but I am certain he is frustrated. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">How could you not be frustrated as the U.S. trade representative for a president who knows what his gut thinks but hasn’t put much of his brains into trade?”</span>"

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials, playing a waiting game on the economy, sought to keep their options open at a July policy meeting as they tried to reconcile differences over whether it was time to raise short-term interest rates again.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed’s Wednesday release of minutes from its July 26-27 meeting suggested a rate increase is a possibility as early as September, but that the Fed won’t commit to moving until a stronger consensus can be reached about the outlook for growth, hiring and inflation.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Several officials, still not yet confident that inflation will rise to the Fed’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% objective</span> after running below target for four years, weren’t prepared to consider a rate increase.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Others, believing the U.S. is close to a fully recovered job market, thought a rate increase would soon be warranted, according to the minutes.
</span>“Members judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information,” the minutes said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds interest rate from near zero in December, and began the year expecting to nudge rates up four more times in quarter-percentage-point increments <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span> It hasn’t moved because of recurrent worries about growth, hiring and turbulence overseas.

Stocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar could all be jolted when the Fed does actually push rates up again, since borrowing costs affect so much in the economy—including how much it takes to buy a home or car or finance a big corporate project.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed next meets Sept. 20-21.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since its last meeting, economic data have been mixed.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Jobs data for July were strong—payrolls <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 255,000</span>—but retail sales and inflation indicators for the month were soft, leaving open the possibility of a prolonged Fed divide that could further delay the next rate move.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Despite the mixed economic backdrop, some notable officials this week have sought to remind investors that the time for another rate increase was drawing near.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“I think we’re getting closer to the day where we’re going to have to snug up interest rates a little bit.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And that’s good news,” New York Fed President William Dudley, a close adviser to Chairwoman Janet Yellen, said on the Fox Business Network on Tuesday.</span> Dennis Lockhart, a middle-of-the-road official whose views often reflect the committee consensus, said Tuesday he wouldn’t rule out a September move.
“Most of the fundamentals underpinning growth of consumption are pretty solid,” Mr. Lockhart said. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">“Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound,” he added.</span> “I don’t believe momentum has stalled.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Some of the Fed’s worries have receded in recent weeks, including whether markets would convulse after Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Participants generally agreed that the prompt recovery of financial markets following the Brexit vote and the pickup in job gains in June had alleviated two key uncertainties about the outlook,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year, but several still harbor doubt, especially because inflation has run below the Fed’s target for so long.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in July and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.9% from</span> a year earlier.</span> The previous three months it was <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.1% from</span> a year earlier.
The central bank divided into three camps at its July meeting, the minutes show: those who aren’t ready to move rates up, those who are ready, and those who say the moment is getting closer.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Several officials “preferred to defer another rate increase in the federal-funds rate until they were more confident that inflation was moving closer <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2 percent</span> on a sustained basis,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Others believed the U.S. was “at or close” to full employment, meaning a state where unemployment was low, fully recovered from recession and at a point where if it falls much more it could cause more inflation.</span> These people believed a rate increase “was or would soon be warranted.”
“By far the most significant part of the minutes was the point, repeated at least twice, that (official) forecasts had changed little during the intermeeting period,” Roberto Perli, an analyst with Cornerstone Macro Advisers, said in a note to clients.
Back in June they all expected to raise rates this year. If none of them changed their forecast in a material way, it must mean they still see a rate hike this year as appropriate, he said. “A move by December was and remains a good base case,” he said.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials also worried that a prolonged period of very low rates could cause investors to misallocate investments or misprice risk, possibly leading to a destabilizing financial bubble and bust.

In the world of corporate borrowing, it rarely gets better than this.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Amid soaring investor demand for high-yielding debt, companies have been able to borrow at some of the lowest rates in history and with some of the fewest restrictions.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">In the leveraged-loan market, in which ""junk""-rated companies borrow from groups of banks and other lenders, companies are taking advantage of low yields to cut the interest rates they pay on debt.</span> This year alone, more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 below</span>-investment-grade companies, including Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Weather Channel, have successfully demanded to renegotiate the rates, and sometimes other terms, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $75.3 billion</span> of loans, the fastest pace <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2007,</span> according to S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">""It's literally been an unprecedented repricing wave in the loan market,"" said Trey Parker, portfolio manager <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">overseeing $13 billion</span> of leveraged-loan investments at Highland Capital Management.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Repricing allows borrowers to attempt to quickly take advantage of improving market conditions by reducing the payments lenders receive.</span> Investors can agree to amended terms or be replaced by others willing to accept less-favorable rates.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Repricings are cheaper and faster than the more traditional way for borrowers to lower interest rates on a loan: repaying the original investors and issuing new debt.

</span>Changing the pricing of a loan is well within a borrower's rights, thanks to a quirk of loan agreements. And, with so many lenders and investors willing to hand over their money, borrowers have seen little pushback.

Until now.

In recent days, a few companies have met resistance when trying to change the terms of their loans. Lenders' reluctance to cut rates may be a sign that the tide of repricings is reaching its peak, analysts and investors said.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">DuPont Performance Coatings, which was bought by Carlyle Group LP on Feb.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> this week failed in its efforts to reduce the interest on <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2.3 billion</span> loan.</span> Part of the reason investors balked: They had just agreed to the original loans less than a month ago, said investors who saw the deal. A DuPont spokesman declined to comment.

Vitamin maker NBTY Inc. aborted plans to reprice <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.5 billion</span> loan Monday. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Michael Collins, chief financial officer at NBTY, said the company ""didn't get a rate that was attractive enough to make it make sense.</span>""

Some investors have balked at the more aggressive repricings, telling investment bankers who propose them they won't participate. ""Our No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 issue</span> is trying to stem this repricing wave, and I think [investors have] slowed it down a bit,"" said Jeff Bakalar, who <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $10 billion</span> of leveraged-loan investments at ING Investment Management.

Still, many investors have had little choice, as there has been a deep pool of rivals clamoring to participate in leveraged-loan deals. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">These loans offer attractive returns, especially when compared with other types of debt, including Treasurys and corporate bonds, that are yielding near record lows.</span> Yields on junk bonds recently fell <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 6% for</span> the first time ever.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, leveraged-loan mutual funds and exchange-traded funds had inflows <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.2 billion</span> in the week ended Feb.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span> the biggest ever, according to fund tracker Lipper, whose records go back <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1992.</span>

Issuance from pools of leveraged loans that sell securities backed by the debt, called collateralized loan obligations, is expected to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach $80 billion</span> this year, according to estimates from Royal Bank of Scotland.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Neiman Marcus successfully renegotiated <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $2.56 billion</span> loan on Feb.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">saving $19 million</span> a year, said Eric Artho, a vice president in finance for the retailer in Dallas.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""I think we got in at the sweet spot of the market,"" he said, referring to appetite cooling off this week.

</span>Sage Products LLC, a health-care products manufacturer, expects to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">save $3.8 million</span> a year from <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.75</span>-percentage-point rate cut on <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $380 million</span> loan. In recent weeks, companies have saved on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 1.13 percentage</span> points. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Sage was ""responding to increased investor demand [for loans] that has been prevalent in the debt capital markets over the past few months"" when it repriced its loan on Feb.<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span> said Chief Financial Officer Richard Naponelli.</span> Revlon Inc. and MGM Resorts International both are seeking <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5</span>-percentage-point rate cut. A Revlon representative didn't respond to a request for comment. An MGM spokesman said the casino operator was ""looking to lower pricing on a term loan.<span id=""12"" class=""red"">""

Companies that negotiated lower borrowing costs mostly could point to strong financial performance since they took out the original loan, said Jason Rosiak, head of portfolio management at Pacific Asset Management, an affiliate of</span> Pacific Life Insurance Co. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">oversees $3.2 billion</span> of fixed-income assets.

</span>Mr. Rosiak said it was an encouraging sign for investors that other firms with a less-sound case for repricing are being rebuffed. ""The dealers are finally finding out they are pushing too hard,"" Mr. Rosiak said. ""It's nice to see calmer minds prevailing.""

64400,"<h3>Opinion | Why the age of inequality has made us less happy</h3>As it turns out, people who trumpet that research ignore a major finding in it: People do express more satisfaction with their overall lives the more money they have on hand. They also ignore a more recent survey of millionaires, which found those <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $8 million</span> banked were happier than those with less than that amount.
A fascinating study released last month offers us another angle to consider in the money and happiness conundrum: It’s quite possible that the age of inequality has come for our happiness.
In a paper released last month by the journal Emotion, researchers Jean Twenge and A. Bell Cooper studied responses to questions about happiness from the General Social Survey. Looking at decades of people’s answers to questions such as whether someone was “very happy,” they found that “money and prestige do appear to buy happiness, and more is continuously better.” But there is a kicker: This was not a stable finding.
In the 1970s, people with different amounts of money experienced similar levels of happiness. But over time a gap developed, one that turned into something of a chasm. When Twenge spoke to The Post earlier this month, she speculated that inequality is a major reason.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Income inequality was not much of an issue in the early to mid-1970s, when the <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 1 percent</span> of households earned less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> of total income in the United States.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But the income gap between <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1 percent</span> and the rest is now at the highest level <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 50 years</span>, driven by everything from the decline of union representation among workers — unions not only bargain for better pay, but also for workplace protections — to the offshoring of jobs to increasing CEO pay.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The necessities of life didn’t come down in price to make up for the difference.</span> Instead, they went up. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Adjusted for inflation, the cost of attending college — either public or private — more than doubled.</span> The same is true for buying a home. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The price of health care soared so high that the typical employer-provided family plan now costs more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $20,000,</span> and comes with a four-figure deductible.</span> (The typical family only pays <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $6,000 of</span> it, but you can think of that <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">other $14,000 as</span> something you might otherwise see in your paycheck, if you are lucky enough to still have one.) <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And as two-earner families became the norm, there was a new, backbreaking expense that needed to be accounted for: child care, something that has risen in price such that in a majority of states, it costs more than attending public college.
</span>What we call a “good life” got harder and harder for many to afford, leaving many to borrow more and more money — mortgages, student loans, credit cards, you name it. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But it should surprise no one to discover that struggling with debt is correlated with greater levels of depression.</span> One study, published in Social Science & Medicine <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015,</span> found those with student loans are more likely to experience “poorer psychological functioning.”
It’s not just that, as research shows, using money to buy our way out of tasks we find unpleasant — like housekeeping or cooking — increases our happiness level. It’s also that money buys privilege — the privilege of health (yes, the wealthy are healthier, and, yes, good health increases happiness), or, say, the privilege of working from home during a pandemic.
In the United States, we buy books on happiness, and we download apps that claim they will improve our mood. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Yet all too many of us live in denial of the impacts of income and wealth inequality.</span> When asked, we routinely overestimate the middle and lower classes’ share of the money pie, and we are more likely than those in countries with less inequality to tell pollsters that working hard is key to getting ahead in life.
In a society that is all but obsessed with the idea of happiness, I suspect it’s simply too painful to admit that our chances of achieving it are greater when our literal fortunes are greater, too.

The Fed Chair Is Worried About Getting People Back to Work
Playing down inflation worries, Jerome H. Powell said policymakers needed to focus on restoring maximum employment.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">As some prominent economists fret that the government might overdo its pandemic response and prompt prices to shoot higher, the nation’s top inflation fighter has a countermessage: Policymakers should stay focused on restoring full employment.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the postpandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,” Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said in speech to the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday.</span> “It will require a societywide commitment.”
Mr. Powell called policies that would bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end as soon as possible “paramount” and said both workers and businesses that had been disrupted by the crisis “are likely to need continued support.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Unemployment remains sharply elevated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.3 percent</span>, up <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.5 percent</span> before the pandemic, and jumps to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span> when adjusted for misclassified job statuses and recent dropouts from the work force.
</span>The pain has also been uneven. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Employment has dropped <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 4 percent</span> for workers earning high wages but “a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">staggering 17 percent</span>” for the bottom quartile of earners, Mr. Powell pointed out.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Separately, he noted that “inflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times,” and later added that he did not expect it to accelerate in a sustained way coming out of the pandemic.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Economists have often treated high employment and low inflation as conflicting goals.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Policies that foster strong demand and pull workers back into the labor market can push up wages as businesses compete for talent, prompting them to raise prices both because they need to pass along their rising costs and because eager consumers will accept such increases — at least in theory.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But the arithmetic has shifted in recent decades, as annual inflation remained stuck below the Fed’<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2 percent</span> goal even during long periods of very low joblessness.
</span>President Biden and top Democrats are moving quickly to try to approve <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.9 billion</span> pandemic relief package. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But some economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, have warned that the large package could touch off long-dormant price increases.</span> Many Republican lawmakers have also cited that risk as a reason to oppose the package.
Mr. Powell did not weigh in on the package specifically, but he did seem to rebut many of those concerns. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He and his colleagues have been unusually vocal in pushing for more fiscal support for the economy throughout the coronavirus era, with some saying the bigger risk is doing too little rather than doing too much.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“I’m reluctant to get into what is clearly a very active debate,” Mr. Powell said when asked specifically about fiscal policy.</span> But he added that “it is the essential tool for this situation.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Fed’s own policies are set to stimulate growth.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The central bank cut interest rates to near zero in March and has been buying <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $120 billion</span> in government-backed bonds per month.</span> It aims to keep borrowing cheap and credit flowing to companies and households.
Low rates are likely to stay for a long time. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell and his colleagues said last year that they would worry only about too little employment, not about too much, and would shoot for periods of slightly higher inflation, aiming to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 2 percent</span> over time.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Officials have been clear that they plan to look past a pop in inflation that is expected to occur this year without lifting borrowing costs to cool off the economy.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Inflation is measured by taking the cost of a basket of consumer goods and services and comparing it to the cost of the same products a year earlier.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Prices that dropped sharply in some categories at the start of the pandemic — think plane tickets, hotel stays and work clothes — are returning to more normal levels.</span> That means the measure will spike mechanically in relation to the <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">depressed 2020 months</span>.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Some economists have warned that a rapid bounce-back in consumer demand fueled by big federal relief packages could push prices higher.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Americans have amassed substantial savings as social distancing policies keep them out of restaurants and malls and as government stimulus checks pad their bank accounts.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">They might spend that money once lockdowns lift even as supply remains constrained; for instance, vacation demand might rebound even with airlines still flying fewer daily routes.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Less clear is whether such a surge would amount to a one-time bounce or a sustained increase that causes consumers and businesses to expect ever-rising prices.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials seem to be betting on the former.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">While prices have shot up temporarily in recent decades, inflation has largely been benign and even a little bit too low for comfort across much of the developed world.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“There’s quite a lot of savings on people’s balance sheets, there is monetary policy, there is fiscal policy — you could see strong spending growth, and there could be some upward pressure on prices there,” Mr. Powell said Wednesday.</span> “Again though, my expectation would be that that will be neither large nor sustained.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Fed officials have gone so far as to suggest that if a large fiscal stimulus causes prices to rise sooner rather than later, that would be a welcome development.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Central bankers can lift interest rates to control price increases, but it is less clear that they have the tools to reinvigorate price gains on their own.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">A little bit of inflation acts like grease on the wheels of the economy: It may help employers raise wages and allow businesses to adjust to a changing environment, and it leaves the Fed with more room to cut interest rates in a future recession or slowdown.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said during a speech last week, “It will be critical for monetary policymakers to look through temporary price increases and not even think about thinking about adjusting policy until the economic criteria we have laid out have been realized.”

46188,"<h3>ECB Move Highlights Differences Between Eurozone, U.S. Economies</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Negative rates reflect sluggish growth in Europe

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 3</span>:33 pm ET

The European Central Bank’s decision Thursday to lower its key interest rate further below zero while relaunching an asset-purchase program means monetary policy in Europe is now even more stimulative than in the U.S.

That prompted a strong response from President Trump, who complained in a tweet that the ECB is weakening the euro against the U.S. dollar and thus “hurting U.S. exports,” while the Federal Reserve “sits, and sits, and sits.”

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point in July and is poised to do so again next week, which would lower the rate to a range <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span></span> That would be well above the ECB’s key rate, which will drop to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.5%.</span>

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Behind this divergence: The U.S. economy is stronger than the eurozone’s, which means there is less reason for the Fed to boost growth.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It’s not an enviable situation to be in to have negative interest rates,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Europe has negative rates because the economy is weak.”

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Here are five charts that highlight the differences in the two economies.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Economic Growth

First, overall economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe since mid-2017.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">While growth faltered in the eurozone beginning in the first quarter <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018,</span> it has remained solid in the U.S.

Inflation

A central bank’s main job is to maintain slow and steady inflation to keep the economy humming along.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Fed targets <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2% rate</span> while the ECB seeks a level close to but just under<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span></span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Inflation has been weak in both economies lately but it has come closer to the Fed’s goal.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Manufacturing

The global economic slowdown has had a bigger effect on manufacturing in the eurozone, which is more export-driven.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">That has contributed to Europe’s weakening economy and helped spur the ECB’s latest move.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Borrowing Costs

Faced with the sluggish economy, European investors are seeking safety in European government bonds, pushing up their prices.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That, combined with the large portfolio the ECB has accumulated through its asset purchases, has pulled yields in several eurozone countries into negative territory, well below the yield on U.S. government debt.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Bond yields fall as prices rise.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Currencies

The stronger U.S. economy has attracted investment from overseas.</span> That has pushed up the value of the dollar against other currencies, including the euro.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">President Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more to weaken the dollar, which would benefit American exporters.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">He pressed the Fed in a tweet Wednesday to cut short-term rates to ““ZERO, or less.”

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">But the relatively solid U.S. economy means that could be risky.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">It could cause the economy to overheat and inflate dangerous asset bubbles that might burst and harm the economy.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this month the U.S. economy “is in a good place,” adding that the central bank would “act as appropriate” to keep the expansion going.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">But the U.S. economy’s resilience means the Fed is unlikely to push rates below zero soon.

Some of the world’s largest energy companies are saddled with their highest debt levels ever as they struggle with low crude prices, raising worries about their ability to pay dividends and find new barrels.
</span>Exxon Mobil Corp. <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">XOM 0.34 </span>% , Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A -0.76 % PLC, BP <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">BP 0.41 </span>% PLC and Chevron Corp. <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CVX 0.51 </span>% hold a combined net debt <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $184 billion</span></span>—more than double their debt levels <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> when oil prices began a steep descent that eventually bottomed out <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $27 a</span> barrel earlier this year.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Crude prices have rebounded since, but still hover <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $50 a</span></span> barrel.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The soaring debt levels are a fresh reminder of the toll the two-year price slump has taken on the oil industry.</span> Just a decade ago, these four companies were hauled before Congress to explain “windfall profits” but now can’t cover expenses with normal cash flow.
Executives at BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron have assured investors that they will generate enough cash <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 to</span> pay for new investments and dividends, but some shareholders are skeptical. In the first half <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016</span>,</span></span></span> the companies fell short of that goal <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $40 billion</span></span>, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of their numbers.
“Eventually something will give,” said Michael Hulme, manager of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $550 million</span> Carmignac Commodities Fund, which holds stakes in Shell and Exxon. “These companies won’t be able to maintain the current dividends <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $50 to</span></span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $60 oil</span></span>—it’s unsustainable.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The debt is piling up despite cuts of billions of dollars on new projects and current operations.</span> Repaying the loans could weigh the companies down for years, crimping their ability to make investments elsewhere and keep pumping ever more oil and gas.
The companies spent more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100% of</span> their profits on dividends last year. This year, the problem got worse. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the April-to-June period, Exxon <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $3.1 billion</span> in dividends and had <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $1.7 billion</span> in net income, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Shell <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $1.26 billion</span> in interest in the first half <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016</span>,</span></span></span> compared <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $726 million</span> in the same period a year earlier.
</span>“They are just not spending enough to boost production,” said Jonathan Waghorn, co-portfolio manager in London at Guinness Atkinson Asset Management Inc. who helps oversee more <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $400 million</span> across a range of energy funds, including shares in Exxon, BP, Chevron and Shell.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The oil companies say they have many tools to deploy to help defray debt, including selling assets and offering shareholders more shares instead of a cash dividend, as well as continuing to cut costs.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are helping ease some of the pain.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">They also say the steep levels of debt are temporary as the companies restructure, and the debt will fall when oil prices rise.
</span>‘These companies won’t be able to maintain the current dividends <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $50 to</span></span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $60 oil</span></span>—it’s unsustainable.’
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“We are in a transitional stage <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016</span>,</span>” said Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden during last month’s earnings disclosures.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The company reported a rise in net debt to <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $75 billion</span> at the end of the second quarter, in large part because of its acquisition of BG Group PLC.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">BP has said it expects to be able to pay for its operations, make new investments and meet its dividend at an oil price of <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $50 a</span>nd</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $55 a</span> barrel next year.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">But analysts and investors say the oil slump is making it harder than ever for companies to raise money with asset sales to pay off debt.</span> Handing out more shares to shareholders is only storing up the dividend problem for the future when the companies will need to pay up. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Even the boost many companies got from bumper profits from their refining divisions—which tend to do well when prices are low—looks to be coming to an end as a glut of gasoline erodes fuel prices, say investors and analysts.
</span>Still, some funds see BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron as big enough to weather problems for the next year and a half. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Wilmington Trust has reduced its exposure to energy companies it deems more risky in favor of other corporate debt.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But the firm remains invested in debt issued by BP, Chevron and Shell
“They’re so big, they can diversify, they have more levers to push and pull in terms of shoring up their creditworthiness,” said Wilmer Stith, senior fixed-income portfolio manager at Wilmington Trust, which <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has $73 billion</span> in assets under management.

</span></span></span></span>Only another long period of oil <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $40 a</span> barrel would pose a challenge that could prompt dividend cuts, said Iain Reid, senior oil analyst at Macquarie Capital. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">A Goldman Sachs report this week projected oil prices remaining <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $45 and</span><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $50 a</span> barrel for much of the next year.
</span>“The question is, can they get through this year and next without doing something radical like cutting dividends?” said Iain Reid, senior oil analyst at Macquarie Capital.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">The rise in net debt has helped push these companies’ ratio of net debt to equity to the highest level in years, which influences the ratings given by credit agencies.</span> S&P has already downgraded Shell, Chevron, Exxon and BP, though they all remain highly rated.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Shell’s debt-to-equity ratio is <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 28% and</span> Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said last month it could even reach its targeted maximum <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 30%.</span></span> BP’s gearing is <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 25%,</span> while Chevron’s <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 20% and</span> Exxon’s is <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 18%.</span>
By comparison, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> Shell’s gearing was <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 10%,</span> and Exxon’s <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.2%.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Back <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> when oil prices were climbing steadily, Exxon had no debt, and its profits were so high that its executives and those from other big oil companies were called to testify in front of the U.S. Senate about their so-called windfall profits.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Chevron’s Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said in April that the company’s higher levels of debt were expected.</span> “We could handle that if it’s temporary,” she said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Much of the new debt has been in corporate bonds.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Exxon, for instance, <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">issued $12 billion</span> in debt in February.</span> Two months later, the company was downgraded by S&P Global Ratings, losing the triple-A credit rating that it had held <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1930.</span>
Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson has assured investors that Exxon remains committed to paying its dividend.
The company has increased shareholder payments <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 34 straight</span> years, although those increases have been modest in the past two years. Mr. Tillerson and others have noted that Exxon has the ability to borrow further. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">If anything, the company has signaled a willingness to go further into debt for strategic opportunities, such as buying assets, including InterOil Corp. <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">IOC 0.10 </span>% , a small company focused on gas exports in Papua New Guinea that Exxon agreed to acquire for an <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $2.5 billion</span> in July
“We’re not going to forgo attractive opportunities,” said Jeff Woodbury, Exxon’s vice president of investor relations, on an investor call last month.

62318,"<h3>To Trump Supporters, Here Are 9 Things This Conservative Assumes About You</h3>Dear Trump Supporter,

Let me start by saying that I get it. I get the frustration.

I, too, am tired of all the PC language that has dominated our culture. I'm tired of having to be careful about everything (and I mean everything) I say for fear of accidentally offending someone and dealing with hyped up repercussions.

I, too, am sickened with politics as usual -- with a stagnant, do-nothing government. I'm tired of unmet promises and of wimpy politicians who won't stand up for what is right and what needs to be done.

I, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again.

So I get it.

I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Why wouldn't we want an accomplished businessman to run the ""business"" of the states?</span> Why wouldn't we want a person who could not care less what people think to break through the barriers of our hypersensitive speech? Why wouldn't we root for someone radically different than what we've seen before in Washington, who promises to get stuff done, while at the same time makes us laugh?

But this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.

For the Donald has said and done a number of things that many analysts have stated should have knocked him out of the race. But rather than causing him to lose ground with you, you have stood faithful. In fact, with each successive event, you not only did not let it bother you, you applauded him all the more.

Therefore, I can assume that the things he has said and done are not only acceptable to you, but are the kinds of things you think will make America great.

So while I get the frustration, I just want you to be aware -- if you are a Trump supporter, these are the things I assume about you:<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

1.</span> You think a great America consists of disrespecting our nation's veterans, particularly our POW's.

On <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> Trump said of former Navy pilot and POW John McCain, ""He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" McCain had <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 5.5 years</span> as a prisoner at the famous Hanoi Hilton in North Vietnam, where he was regularly tortured.

Trump later denied saying McCain wasn't a war hero. He went on to claim that he was a better leader on veterans' issues than McCain, stating that he had put on benefits for foundations like Wounded Warriors. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a recent analysis, Forbes magazine reported:

The Donald J. Trump Foundation has <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">donated $5.5 million</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 298 charities</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2009 and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 </span>(the most recent year available), according to the non-profit'<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 990 tax</span> forms from those years.</span> Of that, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $57,000 has</span> been donated to seven organizations that directly benefit military veterans or their families.

In other words, ""leading"" on veterans' issues means dedicating just a little <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 1 percent</span>. Forbes went on to state:

Wounded Warriors was not among the organizations Trump's foundation gave to in that time period. Forbes also found that Trump, who we estimate is <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $4.5 billion</span>, has not made personal contributions to his foundation during the same time period.

After this piece was originally posted, Trump sponsored an event that <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $6 million</span> for Wounded Warriors. The timing is interesting to me that just shortly before the primaries he decided to increase his giving suddenly <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $57,000 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $6,057,000 and</span> for Wounded Warriors which he previously claimed to have given to but as per above he had not -- see point #5 below.

So I can only assume since, after all this, you are still very excited to place Trump as the leader of our nation's military, that respect and support for our military personnel and veterans is not that important to you.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

2.</span> You believe that in a great America it's okay to mock people with physical disabilities.

At a rally in South Carolina last year, Trump mocked Serge Kovaleski, a reporter known to have a condition called arthrogryposis which affects joint movements. Because Kovaleski denied that <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2001 article</span> he'd written supported one of Trump's claims, Trump publicly ""imitated"" Kovaleski, jerking his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the disability's symptoms.

Though Kovaleski had covered Trump extensively during the '80s and early '90s, meeting with him repeatedly and knowing each other on a first name basis, Trump denied he was mocking Kovaleski's appearance, claiming that he didn't even know him.

Not convinced? You decide:

For any other public figure making such disparaging remarks it could be almost career-ending. But since you not only seem to have given him a pass but applauded him along the way, perhaps it even says something about you. Could it be that you thought his mockery was quite funny, too?

3.</span> You think a great America is where a woman's purpose is to be a beautiful piece of a**.

Trump famously said in an interview with Esquire <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1991,</span></span> ""You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of a**."" Granted, that was <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1991,</span></span> but while his views of many different things have frequently changed throughout the years, there's no evidence that his views on women have.

And while he doesn't hesitate to compliment the physical appearance of women, he also just as easily degrades them as well: insulting the face of Carly Fiorina, saying a female columnist had ""the Face of a Dog,"" calling a lawyer ""disgusting"" for needing a break to pump breast milk, and implying debate moderator Megyn Kelly was asking tough questions because of menstruation.

""I get the allure of a charismatic person who speaks his mind, who appears above the fray, and seems to epitomize success.""

This is not to mention disrespecting his own first wife Ivana by having an affair and marrying his mistress who <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 17 years</span> his junior. Ironically, Trump tweeted in April of last year, ""If Hillary can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?""

Any self-respecting man would not stand for allowing another man to say to his spouse or girlfriend some of the things Trump has said to other women. So why do we allow Trump to get away with what he says without recourse?

It is also difficult for me to understand why so many women support what he says. Could it be if you are female and support him you simply think less of yourself, and could it be if you're male and support him you're just less of a man?<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

4.</span> You hope for a great America that strongly dislikes or refuses to accept entire people groups (and there's a word for that).

Last year, Trump made controversial comments that Mexico was sending us drug dealers and rapists as an argument for why we should round up and deport millions of illegals and build a wall. He also proposed that we put a ban on all Muslim immigrants.

Many, as a result, have accused him of being a ""racist."" And it's the continued pattern of activities and statements over a period of time that has many designating the label.

Perhaps it was because he tweeted out a graphic falsely claiming that the majority of white murders are perpetrated by blacks. Perhaps it was because he was his complicit in the beating of a ""Black Lives Matter"" protester at one of his rallies. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Perhaps it's not just his own actions but the fact that his own father was involved in a segregation scandal through his real estate business.

</span>Yes, in our PC world sometime we get a little hypersensitive, but when the verbiage and actions of an individual keep adding up, there's a point in which you simply have to call it what it is.

But if that label of ""racism"" won't stick, there's another word that should. Its definition is:

a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.: a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, that word is ""bigot.""

As Dana Milbank states in his Washington Post article, ""It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump's outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you're not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot.""

As a Trump supporter you have not only failed to hold him accountable for any such statements or actions, you have often openly cheered him. Is it possible that one of these definitions also fits you?<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

5.</span> You look forward to a great America that is politics as usual.

In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.

He previously supported universal health care but now opposes it. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He once proposed a tax increase on the rich but now stands against it.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red""><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2010,</span> he praised President Obama as having done a good job but now describes him as ""incompetent.""</span> <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> he supported Hillary Clinton's campaign and <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2012 he</span> said she was a terrific woman; but now he states that she is ""the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation.""

He once said he was ""very pro-choice"" and now he says he is ""very pro-life."" <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2000,</span> he supported longer waiting periods on gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons but now is against those.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Up <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2011,</span> he had made more financial contributions to Democrats than to Republicans.

</span>""In the last two decades Trump has gone from being a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and back to Republican.<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""

Just on the recent campaign trail itself, he has flip-flopped on issues such as ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, Planned Parenthood, military spending and the flat tax.

</span>Despite the overall impression he has of being a straight-talker, there is no way anyone can know where he truly stands on any issue. Instead of being the outsider, he ultimately ends up saying what people want to hear rather than standing firm on anything.

Many Trump supporters will defend that politicians change their positions all the time. I rest my case.

Trump is politics as usual -- and you support it.<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

6.</span> You fight for a great America where the ends justify the means and things like faith and character do not matter.

In your frustration and desperation for change you have compromised some of the very things that were once important to you.

There was a time where the particular faith of the president was of extreme importance to you. But now you strongly endorse a candidate who is clearly not Christian.

Yes, I said it. I am almost always one who declares you cannot judge another person's heart -- that we will be surprised in the end who will actually make it to heaven. But in this case, aside from his recent misstatement of ""Two Corinthians"" instead of ""Second Corinthians;"" aside from the truth that in spite of his claim that the Bible is his favorite book, he can't name a single favorite verse; aside from the fact that the church he claims to attend has said he is not an ""active member"" (not one of these alone would necessarily disqualify a person from being a ""Christian"") he also has admitted that he never asks God for forgiveness -- a central tenet to the Christian faith.

Add in his questionable moral behaviors, his ""love of money,"" his ultimate lack of humility, and his complete disrespect for others (all indicators that he does not follow Christ nor represent his character) and I'll say it again: Trump is not a Christian.

For many of you that has never been an important qualifier and at least you are being consistent (though I think it should still give pause to the fact he is trying to pass himself off as something he is not). But for others, it has always been important. Why is it not now?

In addition,<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22 writers</span> for National Review, considered the bastion of conservative thought, just came out to declare that Trump is not a true conservative and, in fact, is a ""huckster"" and a ""menace to American conservatism.""

And as much opposition Trump has expressed toward so many leaders at home and abroad, the one person he has expressed admiration for is Russian president (some would say dictator) and communist Vladimir Putin.

In short, in your effort to try to make America great, you have compromised on all that you once believed... or maybe you never really did.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

7.</span> You believe in a great America in which the best way to win is to bully (and maybe you're a bully, too).

We promote anti-bullying campaigns in our nation's schools and put out statistic showing its links to teen suicide. Yet many of you are making a hero out of one of America's most well-known bullies.

It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue. No one who has questioned him is free from his degrading wrath.

HIs decision to publicly give out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number and social media bashing brings to mind the maturity and scheming of a teenage Mean Girl who belittles everyone around her. Only this Mean Girl you want to make into the school Principal.

As writer Olivia Nuzzi puts it:

Bullying, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, ""involves repeated exposure of one person to physical and/or relational aggression where the victim is hurt with teasing, name calling, mockery, threats, harassment, taunting, social exclusion or rumors"" -- or, to put it more concisely, the entire Trump doctrine.

Many mental health professionals have come out to say that Trump meets the classic symptoms of a narcissist. They opened up about this out of great concern for what a Trump presidency could mean, in spite of a professional rule (as stated in this article) that you are not normally supposed to publicly comment on the mental state of an individual without directly examining them.

As clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis says in the article, ""To degrade people is really part of a cluster-B personality disorder [which Narcissism is part of]: it's antisocial and shows a lack of remorse for other people. The way to make it O.K. to attack someone verbally, psychologically, or physically is to lower them. That's what he's doing.""

""It's no secret that when challenged, Trump's modus operandi is to attack a person's character rather than substantively address the issue.""

Narcissists also have a tendency to be dishonest. Licensed clinical social worker Wendy Terrie Behary, states, ""Narcissists are not necessarily liars, but they are notoriously uncomfortable with the truth.<span id=""7"" class=""red"">""

Michaelis adds, ""He's applying for the greatest job in the land, the greatest task of which is to serve, but there's nothing about the man that is service-oriented.</span> He's only serving himself.""

So why support a narcissist and a bully? Is it, again, because the ends justify the means and you're happy for him to do the dirty work? Or is it, like in all the movies, bullies have their sidekicks? If you're a supporter, are you a bully, too?

Of course, bullying works, as long as the bully's on your side. And as shown by his record of flip flopping and dishonesty, there's no guarantee which side he'll be. One day this bully might end up in the highest authoritative office in the land. A lot of what he says may be funny now, but if you ever disagree with him, some day he might be bullying you.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">

8.</span> You dream of a great America with a strong central government that monitors and controls civil liberties...

...such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press (and possibly even the right to bear arms).

Trump has already hinted he would use executive orders to the same degree President Obama did, for which Obama ""led the way.""

He has also said that we should place surveillance on certain houses of worship and has been open to the idea of keeping a database on people in the U.S. who practice a particular faith. For many of you, this idea of the federal government monitoring and tracking these individuals and places doesn't bother you because he was referring to Muslims, and Muslims apparently scare you right now.

But what happens when an extremist who claims your faith does something terrible and the Federal government decides it's time to start monitoring you?

And in terms of speech, Trump has already demonstrated he'll use whatever means necessary (giving out a person's cell phone #, having protesters thrown out, verbally assaulting and social media bullying, and even boycotting debates) in order to silence his opponents.

Furthermore, there was his questionable statement about closing down the internet:

""We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some way... Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.""

In regards to the press, Trump has threatened to sue the Washington Post for reporting on one of his bankruptcies. His own lawyer once warned a newspaper that if they reported about rape allegations against Trump, he was going to mess up the reporters' life. He stated, ""Tread very f--ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f--ing disgusting.""

Now if he's currently willing to use whatever weapons he has available to him to try to quell any opposing views or press reports, what happens when he has the chief lawyer of the land (the Attorney General), Homeland Security, the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the IRS, the ATF, and other Federal offices at his disposal to continue to do the same?

""First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny? Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?""

In terms of gun control, many fear that President Obama's gun control measures are a secret conspiratorial means via which the government will eventually collect all guns and take over dictatorial powers of the states. However, when you think about it, it's not a president who makes enemies of all the gun-owning individuals that has a chance of taking dictatorial control. It's going to be the one who has pretended all along to be your friend (the one who continually changes positions, even on issues like this, in order to say what people want to hear) who ultimately will have you duped.

Recently, Trump claimed he was so much loved, he could stand in the middle of a street and shoot someone and not lose any votes.

First, does he think families of shooting victims really find that funny?

Second, why is he even thinking about shooting anybody?

Third, what does that mean he is saying about you? Does he really think you're that blind of a follower that you just wouldn't care?

Fourth, what are the implications for putting a bully, so sure of himself he feels he has zero accountability, in charge of the highest office in the land?

Will he then feel he is able to order the shooting or removal of anyone he wants and never lose your unwavering support?

Trump's rise in power has been very unpredictable. I honestly did not feel he would get this far; so it is hard for me to predict the final outcome of this year's primaries and election. That said, if you are a Trump supporter I also assume of you are one of the following two possibilities:

9a. You think a great America is one that looks like Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders?).

Early on, many speculated that Clinton hoped for Trump to be the GOP candidate because he is the one she could most easily defeat. Some conspiratorialists have even speculated that Trump is a Clinton ""plant"" designed to wreak havoc in the GOP.

Trump has indeed deeply divided the Republican party with many conservatives coming strongly against him. He has also alienated a large portion of the Hispanic vote. And neither he (nor any GOP candidate) ever really had the African American vote; but because of his bigotry and racism, he's quickly losing many of the white voters who care about them.

As to myself, many would describe me as an Evangelical Conservative (though that label is a lot wider than people think and it would be hard to nail me down on every issue). <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And while I feel that neither party has done a good job of representing my views, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1986 I</span> have always ended up siding with the Republican candidate.</span> Though I have often been unsatisfied with the eventual Republican nominee, I ultimately each time ended up voting for that person (as a lesser of two evils choice) because they more closely represented my concerns.

If the eventual nominees, however, end up being Clinton and Trump, I will not in good conscience be able to vote for either one. The choices to me would be either a slow death (Clinton, by continuing in some of the same policies of her predecessors that are hurting this country) or potential disaster (Trump, because of the reasons outlined above).

My vote, therefore, in good conscience would have to go to an independent or a write-in... and there are many just like me. Translation: the eventual winner would be Clinton; so I assume Trump supporters are comfortable with that.

Or...

9b. You think a great America is one that looks like Donald Trump.

Trump has promised to ""make America great again,"" invoking the idea of making it great like the past. Most discerning people now recognizes that there are things in our past that were good, such as things your ""momma"" or ""daddy"" taught you about honesty, hard work and respect, and there were things in our past that were bad, such as bigotry, misogyny and abuse of power.

So far Trump's demonstration of ""great"" seems to be a return to our past in what was bad, while ignoring the things that were good.

Many conservatives themselves, including ""Tea Party"" leaders, have said that Trump is actually dangerous for America.

And yet, you as a Trump supporter, so far have ignored this, along with all the other warning flags.

Remember, the Donald is playing ""nice"" right now in order to get elected. There's no telling what he'll do once he has the ring.

<span id=""9"" class=""red""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1 Samuel</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 </span>(that's pronounced ""first Samuel eight""), the prophet Samuel warned the people of Israel that their demand for a king would result in the king's abuse of power, but the people would not listen.

</span>While he may not claim to be a prophet, Libertarian author David Boaz heeds a similar warning now for us when he wrote for the National Review:

Not since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign. Trump launched his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and has gone on to rant about mass deportation, bans on Muslim immigration, shutting down mosques, and building a wall around America. America is an exceptional nation in large part because we've aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone. Equally troubling is his idea of the presidency--his promise that he's the guy, the man on a white horse, who can ride into Washington, fire the stupid people, hire the best people, and fix everything. He doesn't talk about policy or working with Congress. He's effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat. It's a vision to make the <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 16 years</span> of executive abuse of power seem modest.

But it's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king? Does this person really represent our values? Does he really represent you?

Now if you are a Trump supporter, perhaps I've made some wrong assumptions. Perhaps you are a very kind and loving individual who has always honored our nation's military and would never degrade a single person. Perhaps you love people from all walks of life and you get along well with even those you disagree. Perhaps you live to serve others rather than pushing to get your own way.

""It's not so much Trump I am concerned about as the people. Are we really now the kind of people who want such a king?""

But when you idly sit by as he says the things he says and his berating of people's lives causes you to raise your hands in further praise I just have to be honest about the assumptions I make of you.

And if I'm wrong, prove me so. Stand up to him now and then... hold him accountable. Tell him you think he has the skills that it takes and he can still make America great, but if he devalues another soul you won't put up with it.

But if not then, well, I've already listed it.

The question to ask is: are the things I've listed what makes America great? If not, when is it great?

America is great when after some kind of trial people from all walks of life come together in prayer and support.

America is great when we see someone in need and groups band together to try and meet it.

America is great when a person in a uniform is eating out and someone pays their tab, thanking them for their service.

America is great when a person in a wheelchair needs to get through a door and a stranger rushes up to hold it open.

America is great when two individuals can disagree but can still have a friendly one on one discussion.

In some sense, America is already great as long as we make a habit and continue to do the things we get right.

But in this day and age when there are still things we get wrong, are you sure the answer is to introduce more vitriol and hate? Is that what will make America more great?

If Trump were to get the nomination and then go on to win the presidential election, that means one thing: that Trump (through his actions and his words) represents what the majority of Americans have become and want more of. That means Trump is America and America is Trump.

If that is the case, then America not only will not be great... I'm not even sure America is or will be even any good.

So the question is... America, are you great or are you Trump?

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2,</span></span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 7</span>:38 pm ET

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Since Longfin’s December initial public offering, which <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $5.7 million</span>, the company’s price first rose 13-fold, then fell <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 80%,</span> all in less than four months.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the run-up to the IPO, the company, which says it operates computer platforms for trading on the Singapore and other stock exchanges, failed to disclose important information and misstated facts as basic as the age of its controlling shareholder, according to a review of securities filings.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">On Monday, the company disclosed the SEC probe while also reporting material weaknesses in financial controls.</span> The company, which said it is cooperating with the probe, said it may not be able to continue as a going concern.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The shares closed Monday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 17% at</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $14.31,</span> above its IPO price <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.</span>

Longfin went public using a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2012,</span> known as Reg A+.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The rules allow companies with less <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 billion</span> in annual sales to bypass some accounting and disclosure requirements imposed on bigger companies, but they do require accurate reporting.

</span>The other nine Reg A+ IPOs that have listed on U.S. exchanges or been issued over the counter have lost more than half their value on average, Dealogic data show.

Concerns about Longfin shine a light on the apparent ease with which IPOs are being approved under the Reg A+ regime, lawyers said. “Everyone understood we were rationalizing the disclosures [required] but nothing as flimsy as what appears to have happened here,” said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University. “We’re going to look back on Reg A+ and think this was an experiment that didn’t get managed very well.”

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The SEC gave Longfin the green light to sell shares based on one month’s audited financial statements, which showed <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 96% of</span> the company’s expenses were paid to a company controlled by Longfin’s owner, Venkat Meenavalli, an Indian entrepreneur.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The company also provided two years of audited statements for a Singaporean subsidiary, which generates most of its revenue.

</span>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.

Mr. Meenavalli, who says he <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">controls 90% of</span> Longfin shares, told The Wall Street Journal he is “based out of Dubai” but intends to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend 15 days</span> a month in the U.S. He said its sole U.S. office space—a small room with three desks and no computers in a shared-office building in downtown Manhattan that was deserted at 9:30 on a recent weekday morning—is temporary. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Longfin plans to open a bigger office in New York and is hiring more U.S. employees, he added.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Meenavalli rejects any suggestion of financial misconduct, saying short sellers, who have borrowed and sold short <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 15% of</span> the shares available to trade, according to FactSet, are motivated by greed.</span> “They enter into their own fire,” he said.

A tiny portion of Longfin shares were sold in the Dec.<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 IPO</span>. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Two days later, Longfin disclosed that its chief financial officer and chief operating officer had resigned just before the offering.</span> But on the same day, the company said it had acquired a crypto company, Ziddu.com, from a company controlled by Mr. Meenavalli.

Longfin shares rose more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200% over</span> the next two sessions to a peak value <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $72.38.</span>

Mr. Meenavalli <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 48 years</span> old, according to records he confirmed in an interview, although in a <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2017 SEC</span> filing he is listed <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 45.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Described in that filing as “a financial wizard,” his biographies for some earlier companies show him having a computer-science degree from Australia’s Suffield University.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">His Longfin biography lists a diploma in international trade finance from Middlesex University in the U.K.

In SEC filings, Longfin reported it <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 20 employees</span> in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2017.</span></span> The number dropped to two the following month, rose <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 in</span> July, fell to three in November and was reported <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 18 on</span> Monday.

Ms. Altahawi said Monday she is not a company officer, “so that was a mistake.”

Her father, Andy Altahawi, said she was a secretary. He was <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">issued 2 million</span> Longfin shares for advising on its IPO, according to filings. He said he “managed the SEC process as a consultant” and didn’t act as a banker or underwriter. Mr. Altahawi was listed on Longfin’s website as a director until September, when the SEC questioned why he wasn’t included in the company’s filings.

“I’m not a director...never was—what was online was untrue,” he said. Mr. Meenavalli said Mr. Altahawi was an officer for two months but then resigned and declined an invitation to join the board.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">At its peak value, Longfin was included for eight trading days in the <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Russell 2000 small</span>-company stock index, which would draw in some of <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $122 billion</span> in funds that follow the index.</span> Short-sellers said Russell made a mistake because <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 1.5% of</span> Longfin’s shares traded, below <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 5% minimum</span>. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Russell said it made the decision based on Longfin’s IPO disclosures, which said more shares would trade.</span> Its reversal, announced <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 26,</span> sent the shares <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 41% the</span> next day.

Mr. Meenavalli told the Journal Friday that the company now has <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7% free</span> float thanks to the unlocking of some IPO shares. Mr. Meenavalli said Russell told him “they are going to include us back.”

A spokesman for Russell said Longfin would be assessed like any other company during the next quarterly index update. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The spokesman also confirmed that the Journal’s calculation, based on available information, that <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 4% of</span> the shares are available for trading “is accurate.”
