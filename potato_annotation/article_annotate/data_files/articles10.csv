30666,"<h3>Driven By Consumers, U.S. Inflation Grows More Persistent</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation is showing signs of entering a more stubborn phase that will likely require drastic action by the Federal Reserve, a shift that has panicked financial markets and heightens the risks of a recession.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Some of the longtime drivers of higher inflation — spiking gas prices, supply chain snarls, soaring used-car prices — are fading.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet underlying measures of inflation are actually worsening.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The ongoing evolution of the forces behind an inflation rate that's near a four-decade high has made it harder for the Fed to wrestle it under control.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Prices are no longer rising because a few categories have skyrocketed in cost.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Instead, inflation has now spread more widely through the economy, fueled by a strong job market that is boosting paychecks, forcing companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs and giving more consumers the wherewithal to spend.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">On Tuesday, the government said inflation ticked <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.1% from</span> July to August <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.3% from</span> a year ago, which was down from June's four-decade high of 9.1%
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">But excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices jumped by an unexpectedly <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sharp 0.6% from</span> July to August, after a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">milder 0.3% rise</span> the previous month.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Fed monitors core prices closely, and the latest figures heightened fears of an even more aggressive Fed and sent stocks plunging, with the Dow Jones collapsing more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 points</span>.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The core price figures solidified worries that inflation has now spread into all corners of the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“One of the most remarkable things is how broad-based the price gains are,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">""The underlying trend in inflation certainly has not shown any progress toward moderating so far.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And that should be a worry to the Fed because the price gains have become increasingly demand-driven, and therefore likely to be more persistent.”
Demand-driven inflation is one way to say that consumers, who account for <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 70% of</span> economic growth, keep spending, even if they resent having to pay more.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">In part, that is because of widespread income gains and in part because many Americans still have more savings than they did before the pandemic, after having postponed spending on vacations, entertainment, and restaurants.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">When inflation is driven mainly by demand, it can require more drastic action from the Fed than when it's driven mainly by supply shocks, such as an oil supply disruption, which can often resolve on their own.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Economists fear that the only way for the Fed to slow robust consumer demand is to raise interest rates so high as to sharply increase unemployment and potentially cause a recession.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Typically, as fear of layoffs rises, not only do the jobless reduce spending.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">So, too, do the many people who fear losing their jobs.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Some economists now think the Fed will have to raise its benchmark short-term rate much higher, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.5% or</span> above, by early next year, more than previous estimates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4%.</span></span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">(The Fed’s key rate is now in a range <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.25% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.5%.</span>)</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Higher rates from the Fed would, in turn, lead to higher costs for mortgages, auto loans and business loans.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point next week for a third consecutive time.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Tuesday's inflation report even led some analysts to speculate that the central bank could announce a full percentage point hike.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">If it did, that would amount to the largest increase since the Fed began using short-term rates in the early 1990s to guide consumer and business borrowing.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even though headline inflation barely rose last month, underlying inflation, which reflects broader economic trends, worsened.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">A measure that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland uses to track median inflation, which essentially ignores categories with the biggest price swings, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.7% in</span> August.</span> That was the biggest monthly increase since records began <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1983.</span>
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Higher prices have yet to cause much of what economists call “demand destruction” — a pullback in spending that could quell inflation.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Though higher gas prices have caused Americans to drive less, there isn't much evidence of significant cutbacks elsewhere.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices, for example, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 0.9% in</span> August and have <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 8% in</span> the past year.</span> But that hasn't noticeably discouraged people from going out. Restaurant traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels on Open Table, an app that tracks reservations, and was still increasing into September.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Overall, consumers have largely kept up their spending, even with rampant inflation, though perhaps through gritted teeth.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">In July, spending <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.2% after</span> adjusting for higher prices.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The spread of inflation into services, such as rental costs and health care, largely reflects the impact of higher wages.</span> Hospitals and doctors' offices have to pay more for nurses and other staff. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">And as more Americans find jobs or get raises, they're able to move out from family homes or split from roommates.</span> Rental costs have <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6.7% in</span> the past year, the most <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1986.</span>
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Wages and salaries <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 6.7% in</span> August from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's wage tracker, the biggest increase in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40 years</span>.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">And Luzzetti noted that the same data shows a record wage premium for people who switch jobs, compared with those who stay put.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">That means employers are still offering big raises to try to fill jobs.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">Economists had hoped that rising services prices would be offset by falling costs for goods such as new and used cars, furniture, and clothing, after those items spiked in the pandemic.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">As supply chain backups improved, a better flow of such goods were expected to bring prices down.
</span>Yet so far, that hasn't happened.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">“We’ve seen shipping costs come down, we’ve seen supply chain congestion ease a little bit, production has improved and inventories have risen,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">“So all of that suggests some supply side improvement.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">And yet companies are still putting through large price increases for those goods, and that’s problematic.”
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">Such trends could renew the debate over how much corporations' ability to raise prices has been fueled by a lack of competition, a phenomenon referred to as “greedflation.”</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">But most economists attribute the ability of companies to still charge more to consumers' willingness to pay.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">“It appears that retailers are now raising prices because they can, not because they have to.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Consumer demand is still too strong,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, an investment bank, in a research note.</span>"

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The monthly cost of buying a typical home has surged by more than a third over the past year by one estimate, yet demand remains robust
The interest rate on America’s most popular mortgage <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit 5% for</span></span> the first time in more than a decade, extending a sharp rise that has yet to significantly slow the red-hot housing market.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Interest on the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 4.72% a</span> week ago to its highest level since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2011,</span> government-mortgage company Freddie Mac said Thursday.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Fifteen months ago, mortgage rates were at all-time lows.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Rates’ fastest three-month increase <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1987 has</span> made the housing market ground zero for the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Home buyers, already facing surging house prices, are now contending with a substantial increase in financing expenses, further lifting monthly payments.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">A year ago, buying the median American home at prevailing rates meant a monthly mortgage bill of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,223 after</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% down</span> payment, according to calculations by George Ratiu, an economist at Realtor.com.</span> At recent rates, such a purchase would require a monthly payment of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $1,700</span>—<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 38% increase</span>, he estimated.
News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Even compared with searing inflation elsewhere in the economy, that counts as extraordinary price growth.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It also strikes at the bedrock of many families’ finances, Mr. Ratiu said.</span> “Most Americans who buy a home are in a sense making the biggest purchase of their lives,” he said.
Some hopeful homeowners are paying more up front to sidestep higher rates.
The home Sam Skinner is having built in Delaware is set to be completed in the middle of the summer. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In late February, he decided to pay <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $6,000 to</span> lock in a rate <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.875% with</span> Wells Fargo to avoid being stuck with what he believed would be a notably higher interest rate in July or August.
</span>“I’m a very risk averse person, so no way was I going to sit here stressing about rates while the house is being built, not knowing how much our payments would be,” Mr. Skinner said.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Though rising rates have made buying more expensive, the housing market has remained tight.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 19.2% in</span> the year that ended in January.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Interest rates are rising elsewhere in the economy too, lifted by the Fed’s plans to raise benchmark overnight-lending costs and draw down its support for bond markets.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">In doing so, the Fed aims to bring demand into balance with supply, chilling upward pressure on prices.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The central bank is responding to inflation that has now reached its highest pace in four decades.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The government said Tuesday that March’s consumer-price index <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.5% year</span> over year, as costs soared for energy, food and airfare.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">With unemployment nearly back to prepandemic levels and close to all-time lows, Fed officials have called fighting inflation their priority.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As the bank’s policy shifts, much of the fallout plays out far from the view of everyday people, such as through higher financing costs for corporations and muted investment incentives for money managers.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Rising mortgage rates, on the other hand, literally hit home.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Financing property was cheap for much of the pandemic.</span> The 30-year rate was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 3% for</span> more than half <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span></span> In January of that year, it had hit an all-time low <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.65%.</span>
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Those rates helped fuel the biggest boom in sales of previously-owned homes <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006.</span></span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Freed by remote work and lured by inexpensive financing, families left apartments in New York, San Francisco and other metropolises for more spacious suburban houses.</span> Growing ranks of millennials—many starting families and entering their prime home-buying years—joined the crowd of bidders too.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Now, bankers and economists say that pricier mortgages are cooling the market.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index tracking the volume of loan applications for home buying was <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 6% this</span> week from a year earlier, the trade group said Wednesday.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Wells Fargo, which issued more mortgages than any other U.S. bank <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> said Thursday that mortgage originations <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 27% from</span> a year ago.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">JPMorgan Chase, another big home lender, reported Wednesday that its mortgage originations <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 37%.</span>
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Refinancings have crashed as higher rates cut the share of homeowners who can save money with a fresh mortgage.</span> The MBA’s index for refinancing volume is <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 62% from</span> a year ago.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Across all mortgage types, the group’s economists project originations will <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fall 36% this</span> year <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $2.58 trillion</span>.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Eugene Richards IV, a loan officer with mortgage brokerage Spruce Mortgage in Burlington, Vt., said people shopping for homes are seeing their budgets upended—especially first-time buyers.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Higher mortgage rates have also practically eliminated refinancing activity among the firm’s clients.
</span>“I’ve definitely had some borrowers see the rate and be like, ‘Whoa! We need to talk,'” Mr. Richards said.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">As rates rise, the local real-estate market is showing signs of cooling off, Mr. Richards added, noting that pricier mortgages are thinning the pool of qualified buyers.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Other rates on money lent to individuals, like credit-card interest, are rising as well this year, but few are climbing as fast as mortgages.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates tend to follow closely the yield on the 10-year Treasury note—a practically risk-free government bond whose price reflects investors’ guesses about economic growth and central-bank policy over the next decade.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Since January, inflation’s persistence has convinced many investors that the Fed will act much more aggressively to rein in demand.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">In response, traders have sold off Treasury bonds this year, lifting yields, which rise when prices fall.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.12 percentage</span> point to close <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.808%,</span> a new high for the past year.</span> That’s up <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1.496% at</span> the end <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span></span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates have ascended in sync.

18401,"<h3>Share of Americans With Health Insurance Declined in 2018</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Fewer Americans are living in poverty, but for the first time in years, more of them lack health insurance.
</span><span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 27.5 million</span> people, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 8.5 percent</span> of the population, lacked health insurance for all <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018,</span> up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.9 percent</span> the year before, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. It was the first increase since the Affordable Care Act passed <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> and experts said it was at least partly the result of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine that law.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The growth in the ranks of the uninsured was particularly striking because the economy was doing well.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The same report showed the share of Americans living in poverty fell <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 11.8 percent</span>, the lowest level <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001,</span> and household incomes edged up to their highest level on record.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The decline in health coverage reverses improvements since the Affordable Care Act established new insurance markets and financial assistance for millions of Americans who had previously struggled to obtain insurance.</span> Before the passage of the law, more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 percent</span> of Americans lacked coverage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It’s very frightening in that if this is happening now with unemployment <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.7 percent</span>, then what’s going to happen when the employer coverage situation gets worse?” said Eliot Fishman, a senior director at the consumer group Families USA and a top Medicaid official in the Obama administration.</span> “There’s a fear we could see really dramatic increases in the uninsured rate if that happens.”
Surveys consistently show that health care is one of the top concerns for voters heading into <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span>. And candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, several of whom have promised to extend health insurance to all Americans, are sure to use Tuesday’s figures as evidence that the current system is not working.
Several of them, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., blamed President Trump’s health care policies for the higher uninsured rate on Tuesday.
The Census Bureau report also had good news for the White House. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Poorer households experienced the strongest income gains, a significant reversal after decades of rising inequality and a sign that the recovery is at last delivering income gains to middle-class and low-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The report is the latest evidence that the strong job market is creating opportunities for a wide array of workers, said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“You’re seeing improvements in employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">You’re seeing improvements in employment outcomes for the formerly incarcerated,” Mr. Strain said.</span> “These workers who are potentially more vulnerable, you’re seeing the recovery reach them.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Democrats, however, are likely to highlight evidence that income gains have slowed since President Barack Obama’s final years in office.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Median income <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 5.1 percent</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.1 percent</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> compared with less <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 percent</span> last year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while Tuesday’s report showed the benefits of what now ranks as the longest economic expansion on record, it also highlighted the limitations of that growth.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Median household income is only modestly higher now than when the recession began in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2007 and</span> is essentially unchanged since the dot-com bubble burst <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">David Howell, a professor of economics and public policy at the New School in New York, said economic growth in recent years had helped families recover from recession, but had done little to reverse the longer-run stagnation in middle-class incomes.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Democrats and Republicans alike, he said, have tapped into the sense among many voters that the economy is not working for them.
</span>“If you look at the long-run trajectory <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1979,</span> it’s pretty disastrous,” Mr. Howell said.
Health insurance
The drop in insurance coverage <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 is</span> relatively small compared with the long-term trend, but it suggests that policy changes under the Trump administration, which has been hostile to the health law, have made a difference.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The administration cut back on advertising and enrollment assistance, programs that helped low-income people learn about the new insurance programs, among other changes that may have depressed the number of people signing up for health plans.</span> The government also announced that it might begin counting Medicaid enrollment as a strike against immigrants who are seeking green cards or citizenship — a policy that became final this year. Insurance coverage for Americans of Hispanic origin fell last year, according to the report.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The administration’s decision <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 to</span> eliminate a subsidy program contributed to large price increases for health insurance in the Obamacare marketplaces in many parts of the country the next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Research from the Department of Health and Human Services shows that more than a million Americans who were previously buying their own insurance left the market <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span>
</span>But the Census Bureau figures show that the main change in the uninsured rate came from declines in Medicaid coverage. Urged by the administration, which expressed concerns about the program’s integrity, several states started asking families to prove their eligibility for Medicaid more often <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span> The number of Americans covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program fell by more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1.6 million</span> last year, according to administrative data.
“If you increase red tape you are going to lose people, many of whom are actually eligible for the coverage,” said Joan Alker, a research professor at Georgetown University. She said she was particularly disheartened to see declines in the number of children with health insurance.
But Brian Blase, a former special assistant to Mr. Trump for health care policy, pointed to a recent study suggesting that some Americans who had enrolled in Medicaid in the early years of Obamacare were not eligible for it.
“My sense is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 states</span> probably started tightening eligibility,” said Mr. Blase, who is now president of the consulting and research firm Blase Policy Strategies.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">As part of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 tax</span> law, Congress abolished Obamacare’s so-called individual mandate, which required most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a fine.</span> Technically, the change did not kick in until this year. But analysts believe publicity about the provision may have led fewer people to seek coverage.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Historically, health coverage has tended to increase when the economy grows, since most Americans get insurance through employers.</span> Indeed, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 2018,</span> the uninsured rate had not risen in any year <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Income and poverty
Income gains have slowed substantially as the economic expansion has matured.</span> But the tepid progress in top-line numbers hides positive trends under the surface.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“You continue to see some progress for households <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span> especially in the bottom of the income distribution as they benefited from a tighter economy,” said Jason Furman, who was chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“But the pace of that progress seems to have slowed relative to past years.”
Median household income, the level at which half of households make more money and half make less, rose to <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $63,200 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 from</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $62,600 the</span> year before.</span> The change was so small that it was not statistically important. The Census Bureau made major tweaks to its methodology <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> making comparisons to earlier years difficult; by some estimates, household incomes remain below <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 1999 peak</span>.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some of the pullback in income gains was to be expected.</span> Increases earlier in the recovery were driven by people returning to work; for example, households where only one person worked outside the home might have become two-earner homes.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Now, with the unemployment rate near a five-decade low, household income gains must rely more heavily on raises for existing employees, said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI.
</span>At an individual level, pay did climb by some measures. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Among full-time, year-round workers, inflation-adjusted earnings rose more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 percent</span> for both men and women.
</span>And as some workers take home fatter paychecks, it is helping to even out inequality, if only slightly. Incomes grew more for poorer households last year, adjusted for household size. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Poverty fell for households with children headed by women, and the black poverty rate was the lowest ever reported — though it is still more than double the white poverty rate.
</span>There has been a “theme of the recovery finally seeping down to the most marginal workers and families in America,” and “you see that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span>” Mr. Tedeschi said.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The report’s income statistics are pretax, so they do not directly reflect Mr. Trump’s tax cut package, which took effect last year.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Tax Foundation has estimated that richer households probably saw the greatest decrease in taxes because of the changes.
</span>A separate report this week, from the Government Accountability Office, found that wealthy Americans were far more likely to live to old age than their poorer neighbors. Other recent research has found that gap has been growing.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Altogether,<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38 million</span> people were living in poverty.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The poverty rate has fallen relatively steadily <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> when it <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 15 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Among children, the poverty rate <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 16.2 percent</span>, also down <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2017.</span></span>
</span>The Trump administration applauded that progress.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">Pro-worker policies are “unleashing the private sector and achieving historical gains for the most disadvantaged Americans,” Tomas J. Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">But a broader measure that is often preferred by economists tells a less positive story.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">The headline poverty figures count the number of people living in households that earn below a certain threshold: <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20,000 for</span> a family of three <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">A supplementary poverty rate, which takes into account regional differences in the cost of living and government benefits such as housing assistance and the earned-income tax credit, <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 13.1 percent</span> <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span> little changed <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2017.</span></span></span> More seniors and fewer children are poor under that measure.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Government programs, particularly Social Security, the earned-income tax credit and the nutrition-assistance program formerly known as food stamps, kept tens of millions of people out of poverty, the report noted.</span>"
68135,"<h3>Guatemala elects right-wing president amid dismal turnout</h3>GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemalans on Sunday elected Alejandro Giammattei as their next president. When he takes office Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span> he will inherit a nation plagued by years of political scandal, where a recent surge in migration has laid bare the monumenta l challenges ahead.
Giammattei, the right-wing Vamos party candidate who is a former prisons director, beat out former first lady Sandra Torres for the next four-year term. The presidential runoff election came at a crucial moment — as Guatemala prepares for the possible implementation of a “safe third country” agreement with the United States, a plan touted by the Trump administration but with potentially grave consequences for a country whose own citizens are fleeing in droves.
Guatemala is the leading country of origin of migrants and asylum seekers apprehended at the U.S. southern border.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">During his campaign, Giammattei outlined his plan to keep people from wanting to leave, pledging to build an “economic wall” through job creation.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The country’s significant inequality and the abject poverty in rural areas have gone mostly unaddressed since Guatemala’s civil war, which ended <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996.</span></span> The current exodus reflects the loss of hope for many of Guatemala’s poorest.
“We will focus on the construction of a different Guatemala,” Giammattei said when he proclaimed himself president-elect while results were still coming in.
With more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 99 percent</span> of votes counted, he held nearly a 16-point lead. Turnout was dismal. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 42 percent</span> of the country’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.15 million</span> registered voters participated, far less than <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 56 percent</span> in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 presidential</span> runoff election.
In the lead-up to this year’s general election, two of the top three contenders were barred from running mid-campaign, and another candidate was arrested in the United States on drug trafficking and weapons charges. Legal battles to bar candidates, especially former attorney general and anti-corruption crusader Thelma Aldana, were widely considered politically motivated.
No candidate in a field <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 19 obtained</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50 percent</span> of the vote in June, prompting the runoff between centrist National Unity of Hope party candidate Torres, who had come in first, and Giammattei, who had placed second.
The subsequent campaign was uninspiring, according to José Carlos Sanabria, a political analyst at the Association for Research and Social Studies.
“Broadly speaking, in many regards, the campaign was characterized by its weakness. It was a campaign without much depth in terms of proposals or an in-depth discussion of plans for government,” Sanabria said.
“The apathy, disinterest and disenchantment of many citizens toward the candidates and parties is quite high,” he said.
Outgoing President Jimmy Morales came into office in the wake of mass protests against corruption and the resignation and arrest of his predecessor, Otto Pérez Molina. But hopes generated by his anti-corruption platform would lead to disappointment. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">After a United Nations-backed commission began investigating Morales for illegal campaign financing, he moved to shut down the commission, whose mandate expires next month.
</span>Concerns about impunity within the next administration linger. Giammattei was prosecuted for extrajudicial executions after police killed seven inmates when he was director of Guatemala’s prison system. The case continues to cast a long shadow despite his acquittal.
Torres and her party have been accused of corruption and mismanagement. She has denied those accusations, but is likely to face prosecution as soon as the election process is formally over and she loses her immunity from prosecution as a candidate.
Misrael Cardenas,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> said he did not vote. He sells rat poison, used shoes and assorted knickknacks on a street corner in Guatemala City.
“We have to work,” he said. “If we don’t work, we don’t eat.”
Cardenas said he hopes the next president will set the country straight. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Unemployment, poverty and violence are huge problems, he said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Poverty and violence are the main reasons Guatemalans identify as reasons for fleeing the country.
</span>Instead of helping to address the root causes of the exodus, the U.S. government is pushing its policies of crackdowns and restrictions on asylum seekers onto Mexico, Guatemala and beyond, said Mike Allison, a political science professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania.
“U.S. policy toward Guatemala is shortsighted,” he said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The current administration is looking for immediate gratification at no financial cost.”
</span>Last month, Morales’s government signed an immigration deal with the Department of Homeland Security that would force Hondurans, Salvadorans and others transiting Guatemala to seek asylum there instead of in the United States.
The agreement was met with protests and widespread condemnation in Guatemala, as well as criticism from U.S. Democrats and migrant rights groups.
Giammattei criticized the circumstances of the negotiations by an outgoing government, and Torres rejected the notion that Guatemala is a safe country. Once in office, the next president would have the power to overturn the agreement, but neither candidate has promised to do so.
The deal remains in limbo. Guatemala’s highest court issued a provisional injunction against its implementation, determining that it requires congressional approval. Court proceedings are ongoing.

70785,"<h3>The Fed and Rates: It’s the Pause that Refreshes</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Fed stayed on hold Wednesday, but remaining easy now could increase the central bank’s ability to tighten policy later

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 16,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 5</span>:14 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The latest fire in financial markets has only just gone out, and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday showed it has no interest in lighting another match.</span> Paradoxically, this may have made it easier, not harder, for it to tighten policy later this year.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed’s decision on Wednesday to leave rates on hold wasn’t that much of a surprise.</span> Markets had already surmised that recent turmoil would cause it to stand pat. So confirmation of this was a balm to stocks.

And the central bank gave a dovish message on where policy is heading. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">While acknowledging that the economy continues to chug along, the central bank pointed out that economic weakness overseas and shaky financial markets “continue to pose risks.”

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">But investors should consider this as part of the push and pull the Fed will have to undertake as it figures out how to move further away from the zero-interest-rate policy that held sway since the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While this doesn’t mean the Fed has lost its appetite for more rate increases, it shows that the path will be winding and strewed with pauses.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Underscoring the more hesitant approach, projections indicated that Fed policy makers now expect to vote through just two quarter-point increases to their target range on overnight rates <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Following the Fed’s December interest-rate increase—its first in nearly a decade—policy makers had been forecasting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 2016 could</span> see four rate rises.

</span>That prospect had contributed to the unease in global markets early in the year, building on concerns about China and plummeting commodities values. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It had also caused the dollar to continue strengthening, which itself raised fears about emerging-market debt and the effect on U.S. exporters.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">With the Fed moderating its stance, investors moved their focus for further action to the year’s second half.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Whereas just prior to the Fed’s announcement futures markets had implied <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 66% chance</span> of the Fed tightening by its June meeting, those odds slipped <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 38% afterward</span>.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while stocks rose, U.S. Treasurys gained ground, pushing yields lower.</span> The dollar slipped as well as foreign exchange players factored in a smaller divergence between U.S. rates and overseas ones.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">So financial conditions got easier and the Fed’s big worry—that markets suddenly fall out of bed again—became a little less likely.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That, in turn, should make it easier for the Fed to get back to business later in the year.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the pause will likely help keep the U.S. economy, if not exactly humming, from downshifting.</span> And signs on that front are promising.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The U.S. job market keeps getting stronger, with Fed policy makers projecting the unemployment rate is on track to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 4.7% in</span> the fourth quarter.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">And inflation is picking up.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Labor Department on Wednesday said that its index of core consumer prices, which excludes food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, was <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 2.3% from</span> a year earlier for its strongest gain <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2012.</span></span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Core services prices, which are less affected by global developments, were <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.1% for</span> their strongest gain <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The upshot is that the Fed’s confidence in financial markets’ ability to stomach another rate increase—and in the economy’s ability to withstand another round of volatility if markets can’t hack it—has to be on the rise.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Investors may have thought the Fed took a June rate increase off the table on Wednesday, but in the process they may have raised the odds of it happening.

52545,"<h3>Qatar to withdraw from OPEC over feud with Saudi Arabia</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Qatar announced Monday that it will withdraw from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in January, as the Persian Gulf state faces a prolonged regional clash with rival Saudi Arabia.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Qatar framed the surprise decision, which ended nearly six decades of membership in OPEC, as a move to focus the country’s resources on exports of liquefied natural gas.</span> The decision also comes amid a more than year-long feud between Qatar and its neighbors. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Led by Saudi Arabia, a coalition of Arab Gulf states broke off relations with Qatar and imposed an economic and travel blockade in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017 after</span> accusing Qatar’s government of sponsoring terrorism.
</span>Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said in a news conference Monday that the decision was not related to the political clash and that Qatar was leaving the oil cartel to work on plans to boost its natural gas production by more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 percent</span> in the coming years.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“I think it’s inefficient to focus on something that is not your core business and something that is not going to benefit you long term,” he said.</span> “For me to put effort and resources and time in an organization where I am a very small player, and don’t have real say in what happens in that organization, practically does not work.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Though Qatar’s oil exports <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 600,000 barrels</span> a day are tiny compared to that of Saudi Arabia, which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produces 11 million</span> barrels per day, Qatar’s exit from OPEC — the first by a Middle Eastern country — underscored the far-reaching consequences of the Persian Gulf feud.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Qatar is already the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.</span> Qatar Petroleum, the state-owned oil and gas company, said in a series of Twitter posts on Monday quoting Kaabi that it plans to develop and increase natural gas output <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 77 million</span> tons per year <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 110 million</span>.
“Achieving our ambitious growth strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts, commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar’s position as the leading natural gas producer,” Kaabi said.
Qatar also said that the government wants to increase its oil production, the Associated Press reported.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The regional boycott of Qatar has drawn in the Trump administration, which has close economic and military ties to all the countries embroiled in the feud.</span> But President Trump has issued conflicting statements about Qatar. He first endorsed the allegations that the country is a “sponsor of terrorism” last year but later called Qatari Emir Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani a “great friend” when the emir visited Washington in April. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged Persian Gulf leaders to resolve the conflict, emphasizing their shared aim of battling Sunni extremists in the region and in confronting Iran, a primary foreign policy goal for the Trump administration.
Senior U.S. officials, including Trump and Pompeo, offered a spirited defense of the Saudi government after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October by Saudi agents, in statements that have helped ease the kingdom’s international isolation and fueled speculation that the Trump administration would have added leverage with its Saudi allies to end the Persian Gulf conflict. But Qatar’s exit from OPEC on Monday — along with recent signs it is bolstering its military capacity, to counter its Gulf rivals — has made the prospects of a speedy end to the dispute appear dim.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In recent months, American drivers have felt the effect of rising gas prices, with Trump attacking OPEC throughout the year for limiting production.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He has long pressured OPEC to lower oil prices and has used Twitter to criticize the organization.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">After peaking in October <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $86 per</span> barrel, Benchmark Brent crude is trading at more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $61 per</span> barrel.</span> OPEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group’s members are scheduled to meet this week to discuss potential cuts in production.
Five countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq and Venezuela — founded OPEC <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1960,</span> but the organization has grown <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 member</span> nations. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The group coordinates policies to keep oil prices stable and to ensure a regular global supply.</span> But it also works with non-OPEC oil producers, including Russia, to set levels of production.

42538,"<h3>In Early February, the Coronavirus Was Moving Through New York</h3>A new study offers the first physical evidence that the coronavirus was circulating at low levels in New York City as early as the first week of February.
The city confirmed its first infection on <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 1.</span> Mathematical models have predicted that the virus was making its way through the city weeks before then, but the new report is the first to back the conjecture with testing data.
The study found that some New Yorkers had antibodies to the virus as early as the week ending Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23.</span> Given the time needed to produce antibodies, those people were most likely infected with the virus about two weeks earlier.
“You’re probably talking about very early in February,” said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who led the study. “It looks like there was at least low-level circulation.”
The findings were posted online Tuesday and have not yet been vetted by other scientists in a formal review, but several experts said the work was rigorous and credible, if not entirely surprising.
Genetic analyses have suggested that the virus entered the city several times early in the year, but most of those introductions died out and did not initiate the city’s epidemic.
“If I had to put a single date on it, based on current models, we had it as Feb.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19 as</span> the arrival that fueled things,” said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Dr. Krammer’s date is only slightly earlier, he noted.
The study also confirms estimates by epidemiologists working for New York State that roughly one in five New Yorkers had been exposed to the virus by late April, a figure broadly consistent with data released on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“I think it’s cool that we all have similar numbers,” Dr. Krammer said.
The similarity is even more striking, experts said, because the three studies all arrived at their estimates differently.
Dr. Krammer and his colleagues analyzed plasma samples from <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 5,500 patients</span> who went to Mount Sinai for routine medical appointments, were seen in its emergency department or were hospitalized from the week ending Feb.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9 through</span> the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>
The C.D.C. looked at blood samples from people who went in for routine medical exams, but only the week ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 1 for</span> New York City. The New York State study recruited people at supermarkets from <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19 to</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 28.</span>
“When we have three sources all giving you consistent results, that lends strength to all the findings,” said Eli Rosenberg, an epidemiologist at the State University of New York at Albany and lead author of the state study.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
The numbers from all three studies also agree on a crucial point: The vast majority of infections in New York City and elsewhere in the country went undiagnosed. Even in places with large outbreaks, the number of people exposed to the virus is still far from what is needed for herd immunity.
The Mount Sinai researchers grouped their samples in different ways and analyzed them using a lab-based antibody test that is highly accurate and specific to the new coronavirus.
Among people admitted to the emergency room or the hospital during the study period, the prevalence of antibodies rose to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 60 percent</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.2 percent</span>, the researchers found. These numbers are high because they include people who were severely ill with the coronavirus.
But among people who gave blood for routine appointments, or were admitted to the hospitals for reasons unrelated to the coronavirus — a group that represents the general population — fewer <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> of people had antibodies until the week ending <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29.</span> The rate rose exponentially after that, ending <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 19.3 percent</span> among patients seen in the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>
The team broke this latter group down further by the reason for their appointment, and found the increase in prevalence was mostly driven by pregnant women. Nearly one <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 pregnant</span> women had antibodies to the virus by the week of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span> and the number rose steadily to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 27 percent</span> by the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>

What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 14 days</span>.

Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask?
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.” Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.

I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work?
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.

What is pandemic paid leave?
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gives 12 weeks</span> of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
-
Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
</span>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 44 percent</span> of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” but she later walked back that statement.

What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.

How can I protect myself while flying?
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)

What should I do if I feel sick?
If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
By comparison, people who came in for appointments related to surgery, cancer or cardiology plateaued at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 9 percent</span>.
Subgroup analyses tend not to be reliable because of the smaller sample sizes, but this is a large study and the trends are intriguing, said Taia Wang, an immunologist at Stanford University.
“It does suggest the possibility that different groups of patients might have different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,” she said.
Experts were also struck by the relatively flat prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in blood samples from the first few weeks.
“I would expect during this time period, where people are not modifying their behavior, you’d get much closer to exponential growth,” Dr. Bedford said.
Other cities, like San Francisco, have similarly shown periods when the virus seemed to percolate until something — perhaps a superspreader event — triggered an exponential rise in infections.
“We’ve seen this elsewhere repeatedly, and it’s still strange to me,” Dr. Bedford said.
Dr. Krammer is continuing to track antibodies in blood samples and plans to do so for at least a year. But he said he would not expect the prevalence to rise much <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20 percent</span> in May or June, because infections in New York City had tapered off by then."
56377,"<h3>Thai Leader Yingluck Shinawatra Says Instability May Drag On</h3>Prime Minister Is Under Pressure as Demonstrators Plan Fresh Rallies

Updated Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 8</span>:09 am ET

BANGKOK—Yingluck Shinawatra still looks the part of Thailand's prime minister. Perched on a chair at the Venetian-Gothic government headquarters in Bangkok, she counts off her successes since thousands of opposition protesters last month launched a campaign to unseat her—chief of which is that she is still prime minister.

But in an interview with a group of visiting reporters Saturday, she conceded that Thailand's sometimes-violent political stalemate could rumble on for some time yet. ""This might not be finished soon,"" she said.

After a temporary truce to mark King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 86th birthday, antigovernment demonstrations are set to resume on Monday. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban is urging the people of Bangkok to take to the streets at the auspicious hour <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.39 a</span>.m.—the word for ""nine"" in Thai sounds like the term for ""step forward""—in another push to force Ms. Yingluck from office and, by extension, further trim the influence of her fugitive brother, former leader Thaksin Shinawatra.

Ms. Yingluck said that she is ready to dissolve parliament to pave the way for new elections which analysts say her party would likely win. But she stressed that the protesters' demands go beyond what's legally permissible in Thailand. In particular, their proposal for an unelected people's assembly would badly damage this Southeast Asian nation's already fragile democracy, and potentially hurt its ally the U.S.'s efforts to reassert its own influence in the region. ""We don't know how we can follow their offer. This isn't within the democratic process or in the constitution,"" she said.

On Sunday, she went further. In a televised address to the nation, she proposed a national referendum to determine her political future, and promised to step down if Thai voters wished her to do so.

Ms. Yingluck,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46 years</span> old, has faced down crises before. As soon as she was sworn into office after winning elections <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> she had to deal with some of the worst flooding the country has seen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Broad swaths of Thailand's industrial regions were submerged, underscoring the importance of this up-and-coming economy to the rest of the world by disrupting global supply chains for everything from computer components to automobile electrical systems.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Diplomats and foreign business groups credited Ms. Yingluck with helping to revive investor confidence.

</span>She also managed to reach a behind-the-scenes rapprochement with the armed forces which ousted her brother, Mr. Thaksin, from power <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In return for maintaining the military's share of the national budget and keeping out of its annual reshuffles, the armed forces so far have largely steered clear of politics under Ms. Yingluck's term.

</span>But Ms. Yingluck has never quite been able to shake off the perception that her wealthy telecoms-mogul brother is pulling the strings of her government from overseas, where he has exiled himself to evade imprisonment on a corruption conviction he says was trumped-up to end his political career.

Those suspicions erupted with force in early November when the ruling Pheu Thai, or For Thais, Party pushed through an amnesty bill that would have enabled Mr. Thaksin to come back to Thailand without serving any prison time. Thousands of people took to streets in protest at what many called an attempt to whitewash Mr. Thaksin's alleged crimes.

Ms. Yingluck's government quickly backed down, but the demonstrators, led by Mr. Suthep, morphed into a broader campaign to root out any signs of Mr. Thaksin's influence in Thailand—and, especially, to remove the government of his sister.

This is partly the Shinawatras' own fault, analysts such as Pavin Chachavalpongpun at Kyoto University suggest. Before <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 election</span> campaign, Ms. Yingluck had no political experience. She worked as the chief executive at one of Mr. Thaksin's property companies. When Mr. Thaksin unveiled Ms. Yingluck as his election candidate, he described her as his clone, and their Pheu Thai Party campaigned on a telling slogan: ""Thaksin Thinks, Yingluck Does.""

In essence, it was a promise to return Thailand to the populist, pro-poor policies that rattled the country's traditional ruling hierarchies during Mr. Thaksin's term as prime minister, and which helped precipitate the coup that removed him <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span>

In some ways, the Yingluck administration's populism eclipses that of the original Thaksin brand.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">She introduced tax rebates for first-time buyers of homes and cars, and launched a multibillion-dollar rice-subsidy program that bought rice from farmers at up to double the market price.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Thailand incurs a loss of up <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 200 billion</span> baht ($6.22 billion) a year to run the program, but Ms. Yingluck's government is sticking with it despite criticism from the International Monetary Fund and others because it fulfills a campaign pledge to put more money into the hands of farmers.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">""People say we've spent a lot of money, but the objective is to help the poor people"" and reduce the gap between low and high-income groups in the country, Ms. Yingluck said in Saturday's interview.

</span>Her insistence on continuing with these free-spending policies infuriates many of her critics. Mr. Suthep, a former lawmaker and deputy prime minister with the opposition Democrat Party who resigned his seat to lead the current round of protests, describes them as a form of policy corruption. ""This is like buying votes. They are offering all this money, all of these promises, like capitalists making an investment in return for staying in power,"" Mr. Suthep said in recent interview at his base at a government administrative complex his supporters are occupying in the city's northern suburbs.

Ms. Yingluck, though, insists that neither she nor her family are interested in power for power's sake, and reckons the latest round of the crisis stems from continuing ripple effects from <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2006 coup</span> rather than last month's amnesty proposals.

""I think I can say that our family doesn't want to be part of any problem in Thailand,"" Ms. Yingluck said. ""The only thing we want to see is fairness for everyone, and a way to work together to find a long-term situation for Thailand.""

It will likely be difficult to get all the players in Thailand's political drama to read from the same script, however. Besides Mr. Suthep's black-clad, flag-waving protesters, there are Thailand's influential army and courts to consider.

Ms. Yingluck said she was confident the armed forces would continue to play a role in helping to mediate the conflict and refrain from intervening directly, as it is has done many times in Thailand's history; army commander-in-chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha has already helped organize one meeting between Ms. Yingluck and the silver-haired, 64-year-old Mr. Suthep.

Thailand's judiciary, though, might be less predictable. The courts <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008 removed</span> one pro-Thaksin prime minister from office for illegally hosting a television cooking show and ordered the dissolution of a pro-Thaksin government for alleged vote-buying.

This time, Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission is considering a petition from Ms. Yingluck's opponents to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">investigate 312 pro</span>-government lawmakers for backing proposed changes to the constitution. Thailand's Constitutional Court ruled on Nov.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 that</span> the proposed amendments were illegal, opening the way for the anticorruption agency to suspend the politicians involved, and force the collapse of the government.

Ms. Yingluck said she was optimistic that wouldn't happen, though. ""I hope that they will be fair with everybody and stick with the rules, and stick with the principles"" of democracy, she said.

78491,"<h3>Pimco Appoints Man Group’s Manny Roman as Chief Executive</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Former Goldman Sachs banker to take helm in Pimco recovery effort

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 22,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:15 pm ET

Pacific Investment Management Co. surprised the investment world by replacing its chief executive after two years on the job, a sign of the pressure the California money manager faces as it grapples with sweeping changes to its industry.

</span>Pimco said Wednesday that Manny Roman, a 52-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who has led a turnaround of London hedge-fund firm Man Group PLC in recent years, will take over on Nov.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> The current chief executive, Douglas Hodge, will become managing director and senior adviser, the company said.

The change is the latest upheaval atop one of the world’s biggest asset managers, which gains its third chief executive in less than three years. Investors pulled billions following the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">abrupt 2014 departures</span> of former CEO Mohamed El-Erian and co-founder Bill Gross, once known as the bond king for his long record of returns.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The new CEO, Mr. Roman, arrives as the firm tries to stem outflows from Pimco’s flagship bond fund and establish a mix of businesses that can withstand growing investor preference for lower-cost products.</span> Assets in the firm’s flagship bond fund have more than halved from where they stood when Mr. Gross departed.

“Manny gives us an additional resource to react to the changing environment,” said Daniel Ivascyn, Pimco’s chief investment officer.

Pimco, a unit of German insurer Allianz SE, has contemplated a leadership change for some time because of concerns about larger industry shifts, said people familiar with the matter.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Late last year, a small group of senior executives led by Mr. Ivascyn began searching for a senior money-management executive to help shape its business moving forward, according to people familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">That became a quest for a leader who could guide the bond manager through an era of record-low interest rates and a customer shift to low-cost index funds, which together are eroding profit margins.

</span>By Memorial Day weekend, when Mr. Roman visited Laguna Beach, Calif., for a series of meetings with Pimco executives, the group had determined that they would seek to bring in Mr. Roman as a CEO. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Roman took over the reins at Man Group, then a struggling company, in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2013 and</span> executed a series of acquisitions that diversified the business.</span> The firm’s shares are <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 30% this</span> year amid a challenging year for the hedge-fund industry.

Mr. Hodge, a longtime Pimco executive thrust into the CEO role following Mr. El-Erian’s surprise <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014 departure</span>, was viewed internally and by clients as a steady hand who could manage the firm’s operations as Mr. Ivascyn moved to strengthen its investment teams and improve returns.

His low profile contrasted with Messrs. El-Erian and Gross. Senior Pimco executives concluded the firm would be better off enlisting an outside manager, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Hodge, who had advised the search group and was kept abreast of their thinking, agreed.

“I was completely on board with this,” Mr. Hodge said in an interview. “We’re in a very different place than we <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 12,</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22 months</span> ago. And so this was the moment for this.”

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“If there’s an incoming CEO who has experience outside the traditional asset classes, that’s probably a positive in today’s environment,” said Brett Cornwell, head of fixed-income research at Callan, an investment consultant.

Redemptions at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.51 trillion</span> money manager have slowed since Mr. Gross’s departure, but the firm’s flagship Total Return Fund has continued to suffer monthly outflows of hundreds of millions of dollars.

</span>Investors pulled a <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">net $800 million</span> from the fund in June, according to the firm, leaving assets <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $86.4 billion</span> at the end of the second quarter. The fund was <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.9% after</span> fees year to date through June, underperforming its benchmark, which was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.31% during</span> the same period.

Across the entire firm Pimco earlier this year posted its first quarterly increase in assets under management in two years, due to inflows and improved performance.

The amount withdrawn by investors hasn’t topped the predictions of executives at the time Mr. Gross quit, according to two people close to the matter, and the redemptions weren’t the key reason Pimco made the CEO move.

Over the past year, as the firm steadied after Mr. Gross’s departure, executives hired outside consulting firms including McKinsey & Co. to examine the firm’s strategic direction.

One executive placement firm was retained by Pimco for six months to conduct a search for a new CEO, according to people familiar with the situation.

The firm cast a wide net of potential candidates, including executives at asset managers as well as banks, the people said.

At the start of the process, it was unclear the search would result in a new chief executive, though the likelihood of such a change became more clear in recent weeks as the firm’s discussions with Mr. Roman progressed, Mr. Ivascyn said.

Mr. Hodge was among a small group of executives that notified top Pimco executives about the new CEO at Pimco’s headquarters early Wednesday morning. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The group held a town hall-style meeting with employees later in the day.

</span>Mr. Hodge is expected to remain at the firm at least <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2017,</span> a person familiar with the situation said.

Some Pimco clients and their consultants said the CEO switch wouldn’t prompt any immediate moves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension, will internally assess its <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $1 billion</span> Pimco investment but “won’t make any knee-jerk reactions,” according to a fund spokesman.

Corrections & Amplifications: Only one executive placement firm was retained by Pacific Investment Management Co. for six months to conduct a search for a new CEO.</span> An earlier version of this story said at least two firms conducted a search for six months. (July 22)

96420,"<h3>Lebanon gets new government amid deepening crisis</h3>Lebanon gets new government amid deepening crisis
- Published
A new government has been announced in Lebanon over a year after the previous administration quit following the devastating Beirut port explosion.
Najib Mikati - Lebanon's richest man - becomes prime minister, a position he has held twice before.
His appointment, along with the naming of a new cabinet, ends months of political paralysis.
It comes as Lebanon grapples with some of the severest domestic crises it has faced in its history.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The value of the currency has collapsed, unemployment and inflation have soared, electricity, fuel and medicines are in short supply, and the country has been rocked by nearly two years of protests calling for wholesale political reforms.
</span>Lebanon had been without a proper functioning government since then-Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned days after a massive blast <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 4 August</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020 destroyed</span> Beirut port and the surrounding area.
The explosion, caused by improperly stored ammonium nitrate, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 203 people</span>, injured at <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 6,000 others</span> and left billions of dollars of damage.
The disaster - coming in the midst of the pandemic - triggered a wave of outrage against the government and Lebanon's political system. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Protesters blamed the blast on corruption, incompetence and a system of patronage where jobs are given in return for political support.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The event compounded growing anger which had been building since the start of the financial crisis in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2019.</span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the last few months alone the Lebanese currency has <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 90% of</span> its value, while three quarters of the population are now living below the poverty line.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Speaking to the BBC after announcing the new cabinet, Mr Mikati said one of his first priorities would be to restart talks with the International Monetary Fund to secure a financial rescue package.
</span>""You know what a critical situation we are in,"" he said, noting the growing strain on the education and healthcare sectors, as well as the increasing numbers of people leaving the country.
He added that despite his own wealth, he was able to understand the impact of the current crisis on people's lives: ""I have three childrenâ¦ outside Lebanon. So I feel with people. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">I feel the kind of poverty, the kind of hunger they are in, the fear they have of the future.</span> So this is not just a matter of money or not [having] money.""
Lebanon's delicate sectarian power-sharing system had stymied repeated attempts to form a government in the wake of Hassan Diab's resignation.
Since the end of the 1975-89 civil war, political power has been delicately balanced between its many sects, with the president a Christian, prime minister a Sunni Muslim and Speaker a Shia Muslim. An inability to come to an agreement on the nomination of ministers to the satisfaction of various factions and blocs held up the process."
9712,"<h3>Brexit Highlights From a Momentous Day: Parliament Rejects New Election</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Here’s what you need to know:
- Johnson Loses Another Vote; He Has Yet to Win One as Prime Minister
- John Bercow plans to step down by the Brexit deadline.
- Lawmakers voted to force government to release private no-deal correspondence
- Extension question sets stage for a battle over elections.
- <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Parliament will be suspended after Monday’s business.
</span></span>Johnson Loses Another Vote; He Has Yet to Win One as Prime Minister
As the last hours of the parliamentary session ticked down on Monday night, Mr. Johnson had still yet to win a vote as prime minister.
His latest defeat came on a motion brought by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that reaffirmed the obligation of government ministers to uphold the rule of law. Mr. Johnson allowed the motion to pass without opposition.
Mr. Corbyn introduced the motion in light of reports in recent days that Mr. Johnson was planning to flout the law that blocks a no-deal Brexit by refusing to ask Brussels to delay the current deadline of Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.</span> Mr. Corbyn called that an “assault on the rule of law.”
Ministers later denied that the prime minister would break the law, but still suggested the government was looking for loopholes to avoid Mr. Johnson having to ask Brussels for an extension.
John Bercow plans to step down by the Brexit deadline.
John Bercow, the animated speaker of the House of Commons, said on Monday that he would step down by Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""142"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> the day Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union. He said he would not run should a general election be called before then.
“This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest honor and privilege of my life, for which I will be eternally grateful,” he said, becoming emotional as he thanked his wife and children for their support.
He also warned lawmakers to respect the process of the parliamentary system, noting, “We degrade this Parliament at our peril.”
The role of speaker has traditionally been an impartial, background figure, but Mr. Bercow brought new aggression to the role throughout the fraught Brexit debates that have dominated discussions in Parliament for years.
His actions — particularly his criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament, and his decision to bar a third vote on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement and effectively halt the government’s agenda — have made him some enemies in the Conservative Party.
Mr. Bercow’s plan to step down upends a Conservative Party plan to break with longtime convention and field a candidate to challenge him in the next general election. The party had said that Mr. Bercow broke the rules by allowing Parliament to take control of the Brexit process and hobble the government’s position.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Writing in the The Mail on Sunday, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, accused Mr. Bercow of “a flagrant abuse of this process” and of “giving power to the opposition.”
</span>“Bring back an impartial speaker,” she declared.
Last year, when Ms. Leadsom was leader of the House of Commons, Mr. Bercow was accused of calling her a “stupid woman” and “useless.” He admitted to muttering the words during a disagreement but denied insulting her personally.
Lawmakers voted to force government to release private no-deal correspondence
At the center of the controversy around Mr. Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament has been the question of why he really did it. Was it, as his office contended, an ordinary procedural move that had nothing to do with Brexit? Or was it expressly designed to keep lawmakers from intervening in the government’s hard-line Brexit plans?
To answer that question, lawmakers on Monday night voted by a narrow margin —<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 311 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 302 </span>— to force the government to publish private correspondence that would show its thinking.
The same vote will also force the government to publish a classified document known as Operation Yellowhammer, which outlines the government’s assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Many analysts fear that leaving without a formal agreement would lead to food and medicine shortages, among other calamities.
Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative lawmaker who was exiled by Mr. Johnson last week, said before the vote that public officials had told him the government’s handling of the suspension of Parliament “smacked of scandal.”
The government objected, with Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, questioning what legal right the government had to force workers to open up their private email accounts and messages.
Extension question sets stage for a battle over elections.
Legislation that would require Britain to seek another Brexit extension from the European Union if there is no withdrawal agreement by Oct.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19 became</span> law on Monday, a move that Prime Minister Boris Johnson bitterly opposed.
The opposition Labour Party and others have insisted that they will not consider Mr. Johnson’s request to hold a general election until after a no-deal Brexit was ruled out.
That sets the stage for another battle: whether, and when, to hold a general election. The vote on the snap general election is expected to take place <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 9 p</span>.m. and the early hours of Tuesday morning.
The success of the no-deal legislation is due in no small part to the decision last week <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 21 members</span> of Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party to defy him on the question of whether to leave without a deal. They were expelled from the party for their defiance.
The Tory revolt against Mr. Johnson, and his ruthless purging of the rebels, have reverberated through British politics, threatening his hold on power.
The prime minister and many of his allies say that Britain must preserve the possibility of leaving without a deal in order to maintain leverage in negotiations with Brussels. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Opponents of a no-deal withdrawal say it simply cannot be considered because of the potentially catastrophic consequences for the British economy.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Parliament will be suspended after Monday’s business.
</span>After just one week’s work following the summer vacation, British lawmakers will be sent away again Monday night when Parliament is “prorogued,” or suspended, until Oct.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span> the prime minister’s office said.
Lawmakers will first vote on whether to hold a snap election with the expectation that, as they did last week, they will refuse to give Prime Minister Boris Johnson the two-thirds majority he needs to call a vote next month.
Then Parliament will be suspended after formal announcements in both chambers and a ceremony that includes a cry in Norman French.
The suspension means that, if Mr. Johnson loses on Monday, he would not be able to attempt votes later this week to try to secure the snap election before the Oct.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 Brexit</span> deadline.
Boris Johnson Will Prorogue Parliament

lawmakers had about five weeks in session to debate a Brexit deal.

The prime minister, who just had a humbling week in Parliament, will be spared any further appearances there for five weeks. But the absence of lawmakers at a moment of looming national crisis is likely to fuel criticism of Mr. Johnson’s hardball tactics and his determination to leave the European Union next month, without an agreement if necessary.
Lawmakers have passed a bill designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and the legislation received its final approval — a procedure known as royal assent — on Monday.
Mr. Johnson’s spokesman said that the prime minister would not break that law, but insisted that he would not request an extension to the Brexit deadline as the new legislation requires if he cannot reach a deal with the European Union or get Parliament’s approval for a no-deal exit.
How Mr. Johnson plans to achieve that was not explained.
Brussels is distracted by a looming Brexit deadline.
Ordinarily, this would be a week of unadulterated excitement in Brussels. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, who is set to become European Commission president on Nov.<span id=""139"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> is to present her college — or group — of commissioners who will lead different policy areas of the European Union bureaucracy for the next five years.
But Brexit is threatening to put a dampener on this twice-a-decade exercise, as questions of a possible extension to Britain’s withdrawal deadline raise concerns about how the country can remain a member of the bloc without having a commissioner.
The commission, which typically has one representative from each European Union country, has so far refused to be drawn into speculation about a potential delay. Mina Andreeva, the commission spokeswoman, said on Monday that the bloc was working under the assumption that Britain would leave by the Oct.<span id=""140"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""143"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 deadline</span></span>.
Other European Union members signaled that they were running out of patience. France, leading a group of nations skeptical of another extension, reiterated its position that any extension would have to come with a detailed plan of what Britain intends to do with the extra time.
“We are not going to do this every three months,” Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister said, speaking with the <span id=""141"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 1 radio</span> program on Sunday.
The British Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is to return to Brussels on Wednesday to continue “technical discussions” with his European counterparts. These twice-weekly meetings in Brussels were heralded as a breakthrough by the British government, but they have so far yielded nothing in terms of an alternative to the Irish border backstop — a major sticking point in current talks.
Boris Johnson is likely to revive his election push.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to try again on Monday to call a general election, a move that is expected to suffer the same fate as a first effort that fell short last week.
Mr. Johnson’s working majority has quickly evaporated, and new elections would give him a chance to re-establish a stable power base. But mistrust among his opponents is so high that they would not support a new vote until the legislation blocking a no-deal exit was locked in.
That has created an unusual situation in which his opponents, who would normally jump at a chance to vote him out of office, are fighting an attempt to hold a new election, which can happen only after a two-thirds majority in Parliament supports it.
“It’s the most sensational paradox,” Mr. Johnson, who came to power less than two months ago, said on Friday. “Never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and has turned it down.”
Many lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party want to wait at least until November to hold an election. They fear that a strong victory in October would allow Mr. Johnson to reverse any no-deal legislation.
Will the prime minister defy the law?
The battle over an extension has raised the specter of whether Mr. Johnson would risk jail to get his way.
Mr. Johnson has made clear that he wants to complete Brexit by the end of October, declaring that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask the European Union for another delay. But legal experts have warned that he could face jail time if he refused to abide by the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which was approved on Friday and is set to become law on Monday.
On Saturday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said, “We’re in quite extraordinary territory when the prime minister says he is above the law.”
A former top prosecutor, Lord MacDonald, told Sky News that if Mr. Johnson refused to request an extension, “that would amount to contempt of court, which could find that person in prison.”
The government appears willing to “test to the limit” the new law, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab telling reporters that the government would abide by the law, but that it would also “look very carefully” at its “interpretation” of the “bad” legislation.
Boris Johnson meets with the Irish leader in Dublin.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson began the week in a different European capital, Dublin. But the message was the same as it was last week in London: His vow to leave the European Union without a deal was a non-starter.
“There’s no such thing as a clean break — or just getting it done,” the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said to Mr. Johnson, throwing his own words back at him.
On a chilly, gray day, with the Irish and British flags flapping behind them, Mr. Varadkar and Mr. Johnson both spoke of the need to find solutions. But the gulf between them seemed wide.
The Irish border remains the biggest barrier to a Brexit deal. All sides want to avoid the imposition of significant checks between Ireland, a member of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. A hard border could renew sectarian tensions that raged for decades.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Johnson has rejected the so-called backstop agreement reached by his predecessor, Theresa May, which would all but keep Northern Ireland inside the single European market for a few years, so that Ireland would not have to inspect goods flowing in from the north.
</span>Mr. Johnson quashed any expectations that he had brought new proposals. He simply restated the case that he made last week to British lawmakers.
“We must get Brexit done because the U.K. must come out on Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""142"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> or else I fear permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the U.K,” Mr. Johnson said in Dublin on Monday. “I know that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for.”
While both men emphasized the need for a deal, neither seemed to have high expectations for the visit. Mr. Varadkar noted it would be a “herculean task” for Mr. Johnson to negotiate a new deal before the Oct.<span id=""140"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""143"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 deadline</span></span>.
Brexit rebels sling insults at Boris Johnson and his supporters.
There are fights, and then there are family fights, just as there are insults, and family insults.
From the moment last week when Prime Minister Boris Johnson <span id=""144"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expelled 21 Conservative</span> rebel lawmakers who defied him in a critical vote, the Tories have been in full family fight mode, and the insults have been colorful, to say the least.
A barrage of insults came from Nicholas Soames, one of the lawmakers who was expelled from the party. Mr. Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, took pointed issue with Mr. Johnson — “Boris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill” — but especially with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the House of Commons leader who was widely lampooned after he reclined on the front bench of Parliament during the Brexit debate last week.
“He is in serious danger of believing his own shtick,” Mr. Soames told the Times of London on Saturday. “He is an absolute fraud, he is a living example of what a moderately cut double-breasted suit and a decent tie can do with an ultraposh voice.”
Mr. Soames then offered some earthier anatomical imagery before describing Mr. Rees-Mogg’s speech during the Brexit debate as “the lowest form of student union hackery, insolence and bad manners.”
And to think they were once on the same team.

As Affordable Housing Crisis Grows, HUD Sits on the Sidelines
WASHINGTON —</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The country is in the grips of an escalating housing affordability crisis.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Millions of low-income Americans are <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 70 percent</span> or more of their incomes for shelter, while rents continue to rise and construction of affordable rental apartments lags far behind the need.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Trump administration’s main policy response, unveiled this spring by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development: a plan to triple rents for <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 712,000 of</span> the poorest tenants receiving federal housing aid and to loosen the cap on rents <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 4.5 million</span> households enrolled in federal voucher and public housing programs nationwide, with the goal of moving longtime tenants out of the system to make way for new ones.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">As city and state officials and members of both parties clamor for the federal government to help, Mr. Carson has privately told aides that he views the shortage of affordable housing as regrettable, but as essentially a local problem.
</span>A former presidential candidate who said last year that he did not want to give recipients of federal aid “a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say, ‘I’ll just stay here; they will take care of me,’” he has made it a priority to reduce, rather than expand, assistance to the poor, to break what he sees as a cycle of dependency.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">And when congressional Democrats and Republicans scrambled to save his department’s budget and rescue an endangered tax credit that accounts for nine out <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 affordable</span> housing developments built in the country, Mr. Carson sat on the sidelines, according to legislators and congressional staff members.
</span>Local officials seem resigned to the fact that they will receive little or no help from the Trump administration.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“To be brutally honest, I think that we aren’t really getting any help right now out of Washington, and the situation has gotten really bad over the last two years,” said Chad Williams, executive director of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, which oversees public housing developments and voucher programs that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">serve 16,000 people</span> in the Las Vegas area.
Nevada, ground zero in the housing crisis a decade ago, is now the epicenter of the affordability crunch, with low-income residents squeezed out of once-affordable apartments by working-class refugees fleeing from California’s own rental crisis.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I think Carson’s ideas, that public housing shouldn’t be multigenerational, are noble,” Mr. Williams said.</span> “But right now these programs are a stable, Band-Aid fix, and we really need them.”
Underlying the conflict between Mr. Carson and officials like Mr. Williams are fundamental disagreements over the role the federal government should play.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Carson believes federal aid should be regarded only as a temporary crutch for families moving from dependency to work and sees the rent increases as a way to expand his agency’s budget.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Low-income renters and many local officials who run housing programs see the federal assistance as a semi-permanent hedge against evictions and homelessness that needs to be expanded in times of crisis.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">This year, the White House proposed to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slash $8.8 billion</span> from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s most important housing programs.</span> While aides say Mr. Carson privately pushed for a restoration in programs for seniors and disabled people, he publicly supported the gutting of his own department, reiterating to lawmakers last month that he felt as much responsibility toward taxpayers as tenants.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“I continue to advocate for fiscal responsibility as well as compassion,” Mr. Carson told a House committee in June.</span> He declined to comment for this article.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Carson’s most significant policy proposal as secretary, so-called maximum rents paid by the poorest households in public housing would rise <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $150 a</span> month <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $50.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">His proposal has received little support from local housing operators.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Over the past month, Mr. Carson has huddled with Representative Dennis A. Ross, Republican of Florida, who is drafting less stringent legislation that would allow, but not mandate, local housing authorities to raise rents and carry out reforms to streamline the process of verifying the poverty of applicants, aides said.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Still, both proposals represent a paradigm shift in federal housing policy, ending the requirement that low-income tenants spend no more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 percent</span> of their net income on rent.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Tying rents to incomes has been a central part of the system <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981,</span> especially for the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 housing</span> voucher program, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">enabling 2.1 million</span> low-income families to rent private apartments they could not otherwise afford.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Mr. Carson’s proposal would peg rents <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 35 percent</span> of gross income for all tenants.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Ross bill excludes voucher recipients, at the request of local housing authority officials.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“We need sensible reforms to make the system more efficient for agencies and residents,” said Adrianne Todman, chief executive of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.</span> “But now is not the time for arbitrary federal rent hikes.”
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">“This isn’t about dependence,” said Diane Yentel, president of the nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group that has released several recent reports documenting the affordability crunch.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Today’s housing crisis is squarely rooted in the widening gap between incomes and housing costs.”
</span>And the crisis didn’t begin under Mr. Trump’s presidency.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Median national rents rose <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 32 percent</span> in constant dollars <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2001 to</span></span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> while wages remained flat, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The pace has picked up over the last few years, buoyed by an improving economy.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The rent increases are hitting poor and elderly people, African-Americans and low-income wage earners the hardest.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">A survey by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a worker earning the state minimum wage could afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 22 of</span> the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 3,000 counties</span>.
</span>The Obama administration initially proposed steep increases for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 and</span></span> other programs, but pulled back after the Republicans won control of the House <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span>
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">During <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 campaign</span>, Mr. Obama promised to fund an affordable housing trust fund for the construction of new units.</span> But the $200-million-a-year program, funded by the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was blocked by Republican lawmakers <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2014.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> it was on track to finance the construction of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,000 units</span> of affordable housing <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 32 states</span>, according to federal data.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Its sister program, the Capital Magnet Fund, which has leveraged private investment to <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">create 17,000 new</span> units, is in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who tried to cut it <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $141.7 million</span> this year as part of his unsuccessful budget recession effort this summer.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Trump, funding for public housing, vouchers and new construction has risen slightly — against the president’s wishes.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">In March, Republican and Democratic negotiators rejected Mr. Trump’s budget, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adding $1.25 billion</span> to HUD’s rental assistance programs and injecting an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $425 million</span> to the HOME program, which funds state, local, nonprofit and private partnerships to build affordable housing.
</span>Those moves, while significant, are likely to have a limited impact on the larger problem of the increasing number of families who cannot afford a place to live.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">While prices are cooling at the high end of the market in many big cities, the low- and middle-income housing markets in Nevada, Texas, California, Florida and Colorado are so hot, local officials say, that landlords routinely reject subsidized tenants because they can charge more to other renters.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Rental construction has focused on attracting high-income tenants.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2001 to</span></span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013,</span> the number of rental apartments for high-wage earners increased <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 36 percent</span>, while units for poor people shrank by <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 10 percent</span>, according to federal housing statistics.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">With affordable stock scarce, prices are spiking.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">An <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 12 million</span> Americans, most of them poor, now spend more than half of their earnings on housing, according to HUD statistics.
</span>One of them is Judith Toro Fortyz,<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 75,</span> who <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">receives $848 a</span> month in Social Security and <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pays $594.88 of</span> it to remain in the small two-bedroom apartment on Staten Island that she once shared with her mother.
Mrs. Toro Fortyz has been turned down for federal vouchers, reflecting a shortage in assistance that has shut out three of every four eligible applicants for <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Even with an additional housing stipend from the city, she is <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending 70 percent</span> of her income on rent.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">That has forced her to make wrenching decisions, like forgoing her favorite fruit, oranges, after a price spike at her local supermarket.
</span>“I stay home a lot. I’d rather not go out because going out means you have to spend money,” said Mrs. Toro Fortyz, a retired data storage worker. “I have a friend who gets <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 and</span></span>, oh my God, they <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $200 a</span> month. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">I can’t even imagine having that much money to live on.”
Mr. Carson’s proposal alarmed many low-income tenants, especially older ones, who could face significant rent increases under the plan.</span> “We basically wouldn’t be able to get by,” said Patrick Greene,<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 69,</span> a retired truck driver who lives in a small HUD-subsidized apartment with his wife in Montgomery, Ala.
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">A more immediate threat to affordable housing, critics say, is the huge tax bill passed by Congress last year, which imperils one of the most important sources of long-term funding, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.
Novogradac & Company, a firm that provides analytics for the construction and finance industries, estimated that demand for the $9-billion-a-year credit could dry up as investors realize savings through the tax cuts.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">The firm estimates that <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 235,000 fewer</span> apartments could be built over the next decade as a result of the tax code rewrite.
</span>A bipartisan coalition, led by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, was able to expand the credit by an <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $400 million</span>. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">But that is not likely to offset the damage done by the tax measure.
</span>The administration is observing these efforts from the sidelines. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump, scion of a New York real estate family that made its fortune in the 1950s and 1960s building affordable housing for white working-class neighborhoods, has shown little interest in tackling the problem.
</span>He made only passing mention of the issue during <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span> and has pressed Mr. Carson to move more aggressively to impose work requirements on federal aid recipients.
For his part, Mr. Carson publicly acknowledges the crisis in most of his speeches. “Alarmingly high numbers of Americans continue to pay more than half of their incomes toward rent,” he told a House panel in October. <span id=""43"" class=""red"">“Many millions remain mired in poverty, rather than being guided on a path out of it.”
</span>But he is focused less on federal solutions than on prodding local governments to ease barriers to construction. <span id=""44"" class=""red"">He has ordered his policy staff to come up with proposals to push local governments to reduce zoning restrictions on new projects, especially low-cost manufactured housing.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">HUD will also begin working with landlords around the country to come up with ways to make housing vouchers more attractive and more inclusive, aides said.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">“Subsidies are a piece of the puzzle,” said Raffi Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Carson, “but we must also address the regulatory barriers relative to zoning and land use in higher-cost markets that are preventing the construction of new affordable housing.</span> This is not just a federal problem — it’s everybody’s problem.”

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 5</span>:30 am ET

BRASÍLIA—Twenty years before Michel Temer became president of Brazil, he did something millions of his compatriots do, at great cost to the country’s coffers:</span> He retired at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 55 and</span> started collecting a generous pension.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Delaying that moment until <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 65 is</span> at the center of Mr. Temer’s proposed economic overhaul.</span> But the president’s ability to push it through has been sapped after a third of his cabinet and scores of senators in his party were named in the same wide-ranging corruption investigation that helped bring him to power last year.

Brazil’s constitution must be amended to allow its pension system to be restructured, and making that happen is seen as a make-or-break test of whether the government can get its arms around mounting economic problems like rising debt, low investment and a stubborn recession now entering its third year.

</span>New pension rules are considered central to fixing an insolvent system in a country where some retirees receive pensions before <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 50 and</span> surviving spouses can receive full pensions of the deceased while still drawing their own.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Passing the reform would bring confidence in Brazil’s solvency, improve risk perception, lower borrowing costs, attract capital and even help tame inflation by beefing up the currency—a whole positive cycle,” said Patricia Krause, Latin America economist at French credit-insurance firm Coface in São Paulo.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“If it doesn’t pass, there will be less confidence, less capital, higher interest.”

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The budget gap will keep growing,” she added, “and you can’t afford that.”

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Those who oppose the pension overhaul argue the government should keep financing the deficit by cutting tax benefits to corporations and raising taxes for the rich instead of targeting working people.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">“This reform is unfair,” said Jânio Bosco Gandra, who leads <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 171,000</span>-member labor group for police officers.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Temer has already been forced to make a series of major compromises, including exempting state and local government employees from the overhaul.</span> But the future of his initiative became even more uncertain Thursday, after the Supreme Court made allegations public that Mr. Temer took part in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2010 meeting</span> where the payment of a $40-million bribe from construction giant Odebrecht SA to his party was discussed, according to the testimony of a former Odebrecht executive present at the meeting. Mr. Temer energetically denied the allegations.

They came days after the Supreme Court ordered investigations of eight of Mr. Temer’s ministers, including some of those working on the pension overhaul, along with more <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 members</span> of congress.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Markets were initially upbeat about the bill’s chances, pushing up Brazil’s stock market and currency over the past six months.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But the economic outlook has dimmed lately as Mr. Temer’s political plight has worsened, making it harder for him to wrangle the necessary support for the bill.

</span>The timetable for a vote on the amendment has been pushed back repeatedly, and legislators have sought to further water down Mr. Temer’s proposals, by for instance maintaining the lower retirement ages for women and dragging out the transition from the old social-security regime to the new one.

Lawmakers face general elections next year and are wary of angering voters. A running tally of pension-reform vote intentions in the lower house by Estado de S. Paulo newspaper showed on Thursday that <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 101 of</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 513 legislators</span> said they would approve the reform, <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 275 would</span> vote against it. The president <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needs 308 votes</span> in the lower house to amend the constitution.

“I think it will be hard to pass pension reform without changes that would defeat its purpose,” said Rep. Alfredo Kaefer of the right-wing Social Liberal Party, which supports the administration.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The generosity of Brazil’s pension system is legendary—and, economists say, troubling as the country’s fertility rate plummets and life expectancy climbs.

</span>João Mansur, a long-time state legislator in Paraná state, served as interim governor there <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 39 days</span> <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> a stint that qualified him to retire with <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $8,000 monthly</span> pension. He died <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 at</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 88,</span> but his widow, 89-year-old Madalena Mansur, continues to get the checks. She declined to comment.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Temer, who <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 76,</span> retired from his job as a state prosecutor more than two decades ago and <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collects $8,596 a</span> month, though he deducts those payments from his presidential salary.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Other former public workers who retire not only reap nearly the same income they got while on the job, but also see their checks get bumped up whenever those still working in the same job category get raises.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Economists say Brazil doesn’t have the luxury of waiting to change the system much longer.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Retirement outlays will eat <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 43% of</span> the $422-billion national budget this year.

</span>Demographics are playing against a generous system created in great part to bridge Brazil’s infamous social gap. Official statistics say there <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 11 retirees</span> for <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 100 working</span>-age Brazilians; that will rise <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 44 per</span><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 by</span><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2060.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The treasury will <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $58.1 billion</span> this year to cover a social-security deficit that was <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $900 million</span> <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span>

</span>Even current retirees are worried.

“The system will go belly up,” said Mario Luiz Pegoraro,<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 73,</span> a former executive at state power group Eletronorte who retired <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 54.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">He is afraid the government will soon run out of funds to pay <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $1,059 monthly</span> pension and says he wishes he had stayed longer in the job.

</span>“We need to think about the future generations,” he said, echoing the government’s argument that today’s workers risk getting no pensions at all if people keep retiring so young. “Working doesn’t kill you.”

California ordered it<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 40 Million</span></span> residents to stay at home except for essential activities beginning Thursday night in the largest such lockdown in the U.S., as the nation’s total coronavirus cases rose to more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 14,000 and</span> an intensifying outbreak in Europe pushed State Department officials to advise citizens not to travel abroad.
In a letter to President Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 56% of</span> the state’s population, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 25.5 million</span> people, would be infected over an eight-week period.
Mr. Newsom sent the letter—asking that a naval hospital ship be deployed to Los Angeles to increase health-care capacity—before the lockdown order. In calling for people to stay home, Mr. Newsom asked the state’s residents to “bend the curve together.” Nearly half of residents in America’s most populous state had already been given stay-at-home orders from local cities and counties, including Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.
As the center of the virus continues to shift to the West, the death toll in Italy surpassed that of China, where the outbreak originated in December. Fatalities in Italy <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 3,405 Thursday</span>, compared <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3,251 in</span> mainland China, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. China reported no new domestic coronavirus infections for the first time since the outbreak surfaced.
In the U.S., confirmed cases jumped <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 14,250.</span> Officials warned the number would continue to rise as testing capabilities increase and advised Americans to prepare for a prolonged period of uncertainty. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 200 Americans</span> have died as a result of the illness.

- Nations put in place additional travel restrictions to limit the virus’s spread
- American hospitals face a shortage of masks, gowns and other equipment
More than half of the U.S. cases come from three states: New York, Washington and California, according to Johns Hopkins data.</span> The number of infections in New York nearly doubled <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4,152 Thursday</span> as the state <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">conducted 8,000 tests</span> overnight, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In Washington, Senate Republicans unveiled a stimulus package that includes direct cash payments to Americans and help for businesses and health-care professionals.</span> The proposal, days after a Trump administration plan valued <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1 trillion</span>, would need support from congressional Democrats.
President Trump said he is directing the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate red tape to more quickly develop therapies to help patients diagnosed with the coronavirus.
As part of an escalating U.S. response to contain the virus’s spread, the State Department raised its travel advisory, warning Americans against all international travel, and urged those abroad to return over fears the pandemic could put a halt to international commercial travel. The U.S. is also closing its border with Canada, and has discussed plans for a similar measure at the southern border.
The White House said Thursday that the Group of Seven Leaders Summit that the U.S. was set to host at Camp David in June will now be done by video-teleconference, because of the pandemic. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Spokesman Judd Deere said that the decision was made at Mr. Trump’s direction and that National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has notified his counterparts in the other countries.</span> Mr. Trump also plans to convene meetings with the leaders of G-7 countries by video teleconference in April and May.
There were more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 244,000 confirmed</span> coronavirus cases world-wide Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins. More <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10,000 people</span> have died, while more <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 86,000 have</span> since recovered, most of whom reside in China. The rapid increase in reported cases reflects how people in many countries were unwittingly transmitting the virus before governments grasped the scale of the problem.
State and local governments taking on the task of testing for the coronavirus have been quickly overwhelmed. Slowed by equipment shortages and struggling to keep pace, some states and counties are pulling back, using their limited resources to test only the most vulnerable. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Leaders are scrambling to cover coronavirus-related costs, pulling from their reserves and preparing for steep tax revenue declines as restaurants close and tourism wanes.
</span>Health officials and researchers in the U.S. say they expect to see more coronavirus cases in elder-care facilities, despite aggressive steps by the industry and federal nursing-home regulators to limit visitors and isolate residents to avoid transmission. Cases have emerged in facilities from Illinois to Oregon and Wyoming, following a deadly outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home.
Meanwhile, manufacturers were rushing this week to produce medical ventilators used to help critically ill coronavirus patients.
“Every state is shopping for ventilators,” said Mr. Cuomo, whose state has the most infections of any in the U.S. “We’re shopping for ventilators.” The governor said the state is focused on increasing hospital capacity and finding new hospital beds.
Governors across the country expressed concerns over their health-care systems, industries and first responders in a call with the president and vice president Thursday. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he worried the virus would exceed the capacity of his state’s health system in as soon as seven days, and asked Mr. Trump for help dealing with a possible surge.

WASHINGTON—<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first six months on the job were smooth sailing.</span> The past six have been the opposite.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">He has learned that the economic outlook can change suddenly, that communicating with jittery markets is harder than it looks and that President Trump isn’t likely to make his job any easier.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Looking ahead, Mr. Powell will have to apply what he’s learning to a question that could define his term—whether to cut interest rates at coming meetings to keep the economy growing.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Fed chairman is navigating three discrete challenges: setting a policy to extend what is already a 10-year-old expansion, explaining clearly why the Fed does what it does, and ignoring the loudest public Fed badgering from a president in recent memory.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The Fed is always a lightning rod,” said Julia Coronado, founder of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.</span> “Right now, there’s a lot more lightning.”

Mr. Trump called in to a CNBC news program on Monday morning and complained about policy under Mr. Powell, who goes by Jay. “They made a big mistake. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They raised interest rates far too fast,” Mr. Trump said.</span> “It’s more than just Jay Powell. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">We have people on the Fed that really weren’t—you know, they’re not my people.”

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s hectoring of the Fed—over and over through the past year, in tweets, interviews and extemporaneous remarks—has persuaded some investors that the Fed’s decision to shelve plans to raise rates this year came in response to the White House.</span> Investors also haven’t understood what Mr. Powell is saying at times, fueling more confusion.

Mr. Powell’s game plan is to tune out the president. The more he does, the more demanding Mr. Trump gets. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">After the Fed signaled early this year its pivot away from raising rates, Mr. Trump started calling for rate cuts.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Such a stance could boost the economy and help the president as he runs for re-election.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The recent escalation of trade tensions has also fueled worries about a sharper growth slowdown that could force the Fed to act by cutting rates.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">A weak jobs report on Friday added to the concerns.

</span>Shortly after Mr. Powell unveiled the policy shift in January, administration officials arranged an awkward dinner between him and the president at the White House residence. It happened to fall on Mr. Powell’s 66th birthday.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">A few weeks later, Mr. Trump surprised his advisers and Mr. Powell by calling the Fed leader on his cellphone to discuss a disappointing jobs report.</span> “I guess I’m stuck with you,” the president told Mr. Powell, according to the president’s later recounting of the call to supporters.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s advisers are generally uneasy about public attacks on the Fed, according to people who have spoken with them.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">A few believe the Fed is already thinking of lowering rates no matter what the president wants.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow has rejected the idea that Mr. Trump’s comments harm the Fed’s credibility.</span> “We have our views. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">You can have your views without breaking the independence of the Fed,” he told reporters in April.</span> Asked about Mr. Powell’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s criticism, Mr. Kudlow said, “I think he handled it pretty well.”

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">A look at how the Fed made decisions over the past six months—based on interviews with current and former Fed officials, White House advisers and market participants—shows the challenge facing Mr. Powell and the Fed now, at a time when so much about the economy is riding on how trade disputes with China and other countries work out.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">When Mr. Powell became Fed chairman in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> the central bank’s models suggested inflation was likely to quicken given declining unemployment, tax cuts and a federal spending increase.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell isn’t trained as an economist and has a more plain-spoken approach than his predecessors.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He initially thought this would be a strength, and it has been useful in speaking with lawmakers and the wider public or when the economy produced fewer surprises.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">His first year in office showed this breezy style can also be a liability, because an unforgiving audience—asset investors—parses a Fed boss’s every word.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">During an on-stage interview in October, Mr. Powell spooked some listeners with an off-hand comment describing interest rates as a “long way” from a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth.</span> Investors took the remark to mean he thought rates needed to rise more than they were expecting.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell had an even rougher time in December, when the Fed pushed through its fourth increase of the year in short-term interest rates to get them closer to normal and control future inflation pressures.

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials, in September, had penciled in one more increase by the year’s end.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Through the fall, however, they knew the case for higher rates was weakening, owing to a slowdown in Europe and escalating trade tensions with China.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">They began strategizing how they might slow their pace of quarterly rate increases—yet weren’t convinced they should stop, either, since the U.S. economy still looked healthy.

</span>Mr. Powell thought they could strike the right balance by pairing a December increase with a milder projected path of future increases. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials believe it’s the cumulative thrust of policy, not any one rate decision, that ultimately matters for the economy.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Fed’s rate-setting meetings are mapped out weeks ahead of time.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell speaks with the other four Fed board members and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 12 Fed</span> bank presidents in advance.</span> The board’s staff circulates a proposed version of their policy statement together with two alternatives, outlining either a tighter or an easier stance.

The choreography typically helps smooth consensus-building among what can be an unwieldy crowd of policy makers. <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Some officials said it hurt the Fed in this instance because it made them less agile.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Financial markets tumbled in the days leading up to the December rate decision, and Mr. Trump repeatedly called on the Fed to stand pat hours before the meeting.

</span>Priming markets to expect a rate increase “really put us in a box in this kind of situation. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">If you try to make changes on the fly, that’s always very difficult,” said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.

</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">Mr. Bullard and the presidents of Fed banks in Philadelphia and Minneapolis didn’t favor raising rates in December.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Others, such as Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, were comfortable going ahead with a December increase but wanted to more directly signal a pause immediately thereafter.

</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">Inside the Fed’s paneled conference room, Mr. Bullard reminded colleagues that in past periods of such volatility, including under longtime Fed leader Alan Greenspan, they would have delayed such an increase until the next meeting, scheduled for the end of January.

</span>“That is a typical Greenspanian move,” he said. “I don’t think this committee is used to behaving that way.”

At Mr. Powell’s post-meeting press conference, his attempt to calm queasy markets failed. When he underscored that rates would rise less than anticipated previously, markets heard him say they would keep climbing.

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Investors were also spooked after he said the Fed’s plan to shrink its balance sheet was “on autopilot.”</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">The comment didn’t reveal new information but added to fears the Fed was on a predetermined path to tighten credit policy.</span> Mr. Powell knew they hadn’t struck the right tone as soon as the press conference ended.

<span id=""38"" class=""red"">Over the following two weeks, credit and stock markets worsened.</span> Mr. Trump fumed to his advisers about potentially replacing Mr. Powell, though administration officials later said the White House lacked the power to do so.

<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Presidents nominate Fed chairmen to a four-year term, subject to Senate confirmation.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">The law says Fed governors, who include the chairman, can be dismissed only “for cause,” which courts have interpreted to mean malfeasance or abuse of office.

</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">When Mr. Powell returned from a family vacation in Florida after the holidays, he huddled with Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and by phone with New York Fed President John Williams to discuss where policy needed to land by the time of their Jan. 29-30 meeting, and how to get there.

</span>Mr. Powell used a previously scheduled on-stage interview on Friday, Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> alongside his two predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, to unfurl the pivot to suspending further rate increases.

To avoid any miscues, Mr. Powell, who is at ease speaking off-the-cuff, responded to the opening question by reading from a piece of paper. Markets rallied.

Mr. Powell unveiled the shift without consulting with all of the reserve bank presidents. They supported him.

<span id=""42"" class=""red"">“Everybody realized pretty quickly that the communications needed adjusting” after the December financial-market swoon, said Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.</span> “I give him high props for making that leadership choice to pivot.”

<span id=""43"" class=""red"">By March, most Fed officials were projecting no interest-rate increases <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019.</span>

</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">And officials said that in six months, they would end the credit-tightening practice of allowing Fed-owned bonds to expire unreplaced.

</span>Both of these were moves Mr. Trump had wanted a few months earlier.

The shift soothed markets, but not Mr. Trump. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">He said the Fed should cut short-term rates, and announced plans to name outspoken loyalists—and central bank critics—to the Fed’s board.

</span>Mr. Trump called Mr. Powell on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 11 to</span> talk about the need for lower rates. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">He reached the Fed leader <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 9 p</span>.m., just after Mr. Powell delivered remarks at the House Democrats’ annual retreat that defended the central bank’s independence.

</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Investors in futures markets began to place higher odds on a rate cut in the lead-up to the Fed’s most recent meeting, April 30-<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 1.</span>

Mr. Powell, in his press conference after the May meeting, pushed back against those expectations, when he described a recent inflation slowdown as temporary.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">That confounded some investors because Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, have also signaled more alarm over why inflation isn’t rising more.

</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">“There is a good deal of confusion about what the Fed is doing and why they’re doing it, and the Fed is responsible for some of that,” said Robert Brusca, who runs an economic consulting firm in New York.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Since Fed officials last met, the economic outlook has turned bleaker with the worsening of trade tensions with China.</span> Bond markets turned more anxious after Mr. Trump’s unexpected decision to threaten tariffs on Mexico to secure tighter migration curbs.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">Rising worry about a pullback in business sentiment and investment from a sustained conflict is giving the Fed new reason to consider rate cuts.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Generally speaking, the Fed will want to move more quickly than it has in previous cycles to shore up growth at the first hint of any economic contraction because with its short-term benchmark at a historically low range of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2.25% and</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.5%,</span> it doesn’t have as much room to cut rates as in previous downturns.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The upshot is if the administration’s trade uncertainty harms the economy, the Fed may have little choice but to respond by cutting rates.</span> “They can’t play political brinksmanship with the president,” said Ms. Coronado of MacroPolicy Perspectives.

<span id=""54"" class=""red"">On a recent trip through Asia, Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, said he was struck by questions from clients who assumed that the Fed had shifted its footing this year because of Mr. Trump’s pressure.

</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">“People who know the Fed understand that’s not what’s going on, but the further you go from the U.S., the more you hear this,” said Mr. Hooper, a former Fed economist.

</span><span id=""56"" class=""red"">Even if some investors thought the Fed was acting politically by scrapping rate increases, there’s little evidence they believe this was a policy error.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">If they did, this should be reflected in bets on faster inflation, such as rising break-even rates derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities.

</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“That’s when you see people putting money where their mouth is,” said Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed.

</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell has told colleagues they could deal with presidential pestering by giving Mr. Trump what he wants—at tremendous cost to the institution’s hard-won credibility—or by reflexively doing the opposite, burnishing their independence in a foolhardy way that risks recession.</span> The right course, he has said, is to make decisions based on their objective analysis of data—realizing that some calls may look like a concession to the president and others may look like a rebuke.

To tune out politics, Mr. Powell tells associates they must focus on “controlling the controllable,” borrowing a favorite phrase from George Sherman, the former Danaher Corp. chief executive. The two men worked together during Mr. Powell’s past career in private equity.

<span id=""60"" class=""red"">Presidents have long tried to influence the Fed.</span> <span id=""61"" class=""red"">President Nixon pushed his longtime adviser, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns, to stimulate the economy ahead of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1972 election</span>.</span> <span id=""62"" class=""red"">Inflation later accelerated.

</span><span id=""63"" class=""red"">President George H.W. Bush and his advisers frequently said the Fed kept too tight a grip on the money supply because of its preoccupation with inflation.</span> Then-Chairman Greenspan wasn’t swayed.

Over lunch last fall, Mr. Greenspan discussed with Mr. Powell the advice he offers anyone when asked about dealing with the White House: Wear earmuffs.

<span id=""64"" class=""red"">Since the 1990s, the Fed and central banks in other democracies have operated with greater political independence.</span> Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz carries around a fortune from a cookie at a Chinese-Thai restaurant in Ottawa that reads, “You are independent politically.” He keeps it in a plastic sleeve in his wallet.

Such institutional autonomy annoys Mr. Trump. <span id=""65"" class=""red"">He told advisers he is more concerned about the Fed’s rate increases hurting the economy than about any disruption from higher tariffs.</span> In complaining that Mr. Powell lacks a “feel” for the markets, he likened him to a golfer who can’t putt.

Though Mr. Powell almost never refers to Mr. Trump by name, he has indicated to lawmakers and colleagues that he recognizes an important part of his four-year term will be to shield the institution from any political pressure.

“We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work,” Mr. Powell said at a January news conference. “We’re human. We make mistakes. <span id=""66"" class=""red"">But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity.”

Mr. Powell, who began his career as a lawyer, has made clear to associates there aren’t any circumstances under which he would leave his job voluntarily, meaning a court battle would likely ensue should Mr. Trump try to remove him before his term expires <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span>

</span><span id=""67"" class=""red"">People who suspect Mr. Powell will cave to Mr. Trump don’t know the man, said former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher.

</span>He cited, among other things, Mr. Powell’s wealth and his respected stature in Washington. <span id=""68"" class=""red"">Financial disclosures <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 showed</span> Mr. Powell owned assets worth <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $20 million</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $55 million</span>.

</span>“He’s very comfortable in his own skin,” said Mr. Fisher. <span id=""69"" class=""red"">“You or I would probably be a little bit comfortable in our own skin if we had that.”

16694,"<h3>Emails Show The Oil Lobby Mobilized Democratic Governors' Opposition To Biden Energy Order</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Fossil fuel trade groups in Louisiana and New Mexico rallied Democratic governors in opposition to President Joe Biden’s executive order pausing new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and in offshore waters, newly released emails show.
</span>The Biden administration paused new leases on Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27 and</span> launched a major review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. Interior Department officials have said the program currently is “not serving the American public well.”
The behind-the-scenes lobbying included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA) introducing top energy officials in Louisiana and New Mexico to each other. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">LMOGA also provided the Louisiana official with industry talking points about how restricting oil and gas development would hurt the state’s economy, and it helped ghostwrite a letter that Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) sent to Biden arguing, among other things, that confronting climate effects depends on continued offshore fossil fuel development.
</span>The communications highlight the growing role regional industry associations play in fighting climate action as pressure mounts on big-name companies and highly visible national groups to put a softer face on regulatory obstruction.
Edwards and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) have both spoken out against the Biden administration’s leasing freeze, publicly and in letters to the president. Louisiana joined more than a dozen other states in suing the administration over the executive order, and Lujan Grisham requested New Mexico be exempt from the pause because of its climate change initiatives and greenhouse gas emission reductions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Both states are major oil and gas producers and rely heavily on revenue from fossil fuel development.
</span>“These documents show that the Lujan Grisham and Bel Edwards administrations are valuable assets in the oil industry’s fight against President Biden’s public lands policies,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior investigator with the watchdog group Documented.
Documented and the Energy and Policy Institute, another watchdog organization, obtained the communications via state public records requests and shared them exclusively with HuffPost.
The day before Biden was expected to sign his order, Lori LeBlanc, vice president of LMOGA, emailed an Edwards staffer to request a meeting to “discuss the federal executive orders around the leasing and drilling permit bans on federal lands and offshore,” falsely characterizing the upcoming order as an all-out ban. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Documents show she and other representatives of the oil trade group had a Zoom meeting Jan.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27 with</span> Edwards’ staff, including Thomas Harris, secretary of Louisiana’s Department of Natural Resources, and Chip Kline, executive assistant to the governor for coastal activities and the chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Board.
</span>The following day, LMOGA President Tyler Gray copied Harris in an email to Ryan Flynn, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA).
“Perhaps there’s a way that NMOGA and LMOGA can work with the governors of New Mexico and Louisiana to approach the Administration in a collaborative way to give consideration for the critical importance of the natural gas and oil industry in our respective states,” Gray wrote.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Harris promptly responded, thanking Gray for connecting him with the New Mexico trade group.</span> “I appreciate the introduction and look forward to working with NMOGA and Governor Grisham’s staff,” he wrote. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We certainly share a common interest.”
</span>Things progressed quickly from there. Flynn connected Harris with Harris’s counterpart in New Mexico, Sarah Propst, secretary of the state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, as well as Adriene Sandoval, director of the department’s Oil Conservation Division. Propst and Harris agreed to meet the following week, on Feb.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I believe that New Mexico and Louisiana have many shared interest [sic] and that we can work together cooperatively on this and on future issues,” Harris wrote to Propst.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The heads of both industry trade groups were copied on emails throughout the exchange.
</span>On Feb.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> LMOGA connected Harris to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 joined</span> a lawsuit aimed at allowing the government to greenlight oil and gas development on federal lands without considering the effects on the climate. That same day, Harris spoke at a webinar that LMOGA hosted. During the event, he outlined Edwards’s efforts to push back against the leasing freeze and convince the Biden administration that “cutting domestic production is NOT the path forward,” according to prepared talking points obtained through records requests. That effort, he told the industry group, included “listening to the concerns of CEOs and industry representatives,” as well as reaching out to governors, members of Congress and the Biden administration.
Instead of making “public, inflammatory comments that would impair his effectiveness in getting a seat at the table and having our legitimate concerns heard,” Edwards “is trying [to] have actual influence on Federal Energy Policy moving forward,” Harris’s prepared remarks read. “Toward that goal, we would certainly welcome any information, data or talking points that your companies believe might help in that cause. Gov. Edwards is planning to speak to Biden’s [Department of Energy] secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm next week and it is not too late to update his talking points.”
The document goes on to note that during a meeting with LMOGA’s president and other industry leaders the day before, Edwards “instructed” Harris to “work with Tyler [Gray] in drafting a letter for [Edwards’s] signature,” in which the governor would ask the administration to continue issuing permits on existing leases. “We are working with LMOGA staff to craft language for that letter,” Harris’s document says.
Shauna Sanford, a spokesperson for Edwards, told HuffPost the governor’s team regularly seeks input from stakeholders, including industry leaders and community groups, as it works to understand and assess potential effects of federal policy decisions.
“The Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources has expertise in many aspects of the exploration and production but does not regulate or directly interact with [outer continental shelf] energy activity,” she said in an email. “Therefore, Secretary Tom Harris and his staff did vet and make use of information provided by LMOGA that appeared to be verifiable and relevant in creating a draft letter for the Governor’s review. LMOGA was one source of several used by the state in drafting letters written on the subject.”
Sanford confirmed that LMOGA assisted with the letter Edwards sent to Biden on Feb.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> in which the governor swung back against the leasing pause and touted the state’s efforts to address climate change and reduce emissions.
“I urge you to keep in mind that our ability to address Louisiana’s climate related challenges, improve our structural resilience to catastrophic weather events, combat coastal land loss, and reduce our carbon footprint relies heavily on sustainable and predictable oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico,” Edwards wrote. The pause, he added, “creates uncertainty in our coastal planning process.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Of course, business-as-usual fossil fuel production could lock in potentially catastrophic economic and environmental damage not only in Louisiana but also across the globe.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In New Mexico, Lujan Grisham’s staff communicated “frequently with large operators and the trade associations,” including NMOGA and the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, Caroline Buerkle, one of the governor's top staffers, wrote in a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 12 email</span> response to a county official who reached out about Biden’s executive orders.
</span>Though it was LMOGA and NMOGA that connected the New Mexico administration to Louisiana officials, the documents HuffPost reviewed do not show industry associations directly shaping New Mexico’s response in the way that they did Louisiana’s.
“NMOGA and other industry groups have not been involved at all in New Mexico’s response to the Biden administration’s policies and directives,” Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan Grisham, said in an email response. “State officials frequently and productively communicate and collaborate with other states, nonprofits, local government officials as well as industry groups as we not only develop and execute innovative clean-energy policies but ensure federal regulations do not overly or unnecessarily burden New Mexico’s budgetary outlook.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">In addition to a letter Lujan Grisham sent to Biden on <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 15,</span> Propst wrote to top Interior Department officials in February informing them that the leasing pause had resulted in “on-the-ground uncertainties that undermine our ability to safeguard New Mexico’s economy and environment.”
</span>Around the same time that NMOGA was communicating with Lujan Grisham’s office about Biden’s order, the industry association was celebrating its success in lobbying for changes to a proposed state rule regulating methane pollution, as The Guardian reported last week. During a Feb.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 presentation</span> to its board, NMOGA said the state had <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">accepted 72 of</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 173 suggested</span> changes to the rule.
The “process has been fruitful,” the group wrote in its presentation, adding that there had been “significant changes in favor of industry.”

This week, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., one of the front-runners in the race for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, revealed her radical vision for American health care – outlawing private health insurance and putting the government in charge of the system.
Harris, along <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 15 of</span> her Democratic colleagues, supports Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., vision of ""Medicare-for-all."" Sanders'<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>bill</span>, S.1804, was explicit about outlawing private health insurance. At a town hall in Iowa last Monday, Harris confirmed she was on board with that idea. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">In other words, Harris is running for president on a platform of taking away the private insurance coverage of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 million</span> people, and dumping everyone into a one-size-fits-all government-run health plan that would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars.</span> And if the experiences of other countries with single-payer health care are any indication, it would result in long waits for poor care.
I'M <span id=""1"" class=""red"">A DEMOCRAT BUT MEDICARE FOR ALL IS NOT THE ANSWER -- HERE ARE FOUR SUGGESTIONS
Support for single-payer appears to be the price of admission to the Democratic presidential race.</span> Harris's fellow presidential aspirants, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Cory Booker, D.-N.J., were among the co-sponsors of Sanders'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>“Medicare-for-all” legislation. And it's only a matter of time before Sanders himself, the pied piper of the ""Medicare-for-all” movement, joins the race.
""Medicare-for-all’s"" advocates promise a health care system that's free at the point of service – no co-pays, no deductibles, no coinsurance.
They tend to be less upfront about how they'd pay for it. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Independent estimates from both the right and the left peg ""Medicare-for-all’s” cost at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $32 trillion</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10 years</span>.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Doubling what the federal government takes in individual and corporate income tax revenue wouldn't be enough to cover that tab.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">That's assuming “Medicare-for-all” is able to implement its financing strategy.</span> The bill proposes reimbursing doctors and hospitals at Medicare's current rates, which <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 40 percent</span> below what private insurance pays.
Health care providers are unlikely to just absorb those cuts. Those with narrow margins – say, in rural areas – may be forced to close, unable to cover their costs. Some doctors may respond to lower payments by seeing fewer patients, retiring early, or leaving the practice of medicine altogether. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Bright young people may decide not to pursue careers in medicine, given that “Medicare for all” will limit their earning power.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Regardless, ratcheting down the price of care by force is going to cause health care providers to supply less of it.</span> And that will lead to longer waits for patients.
American patients will not stand for the higher taxes and lower-quality care that “Medicare-for-all” would bring.
Long waits plague patients in other countries with government-run health care. Take Canada, which outlaws private health insurance for anything considered medically necessary, just as “Medicare for all” would. The median wait for treatment from a specialist following referral by a general practitioner <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 19.8 weeks</span>, according to the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank. <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1993,</span> the median wait was less than half as much –<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9.3 weeks</span>.
Waits are far longer for some specialties. For orthopedic surgery, the median wait for specialist treatment <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 39 weeks</span>.
Many Canadians are uninterested in waiting multiple months for treatment, particularly if they're in pain or fear they may have a serious illness. So they pay out of pocket for care abroad. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 63,000 Canadians</span> went to another country to receive medical treatment.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the United Kingdom's government-run, 70-year old National Health Service, is proving similarly incapable of providing quality care. The system is currently <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">short 100,000 health</span> professionals – doctors, nurses and other workers.
It's no <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wonder 14 percent</span> of operations are canceled right before they are supposed to happen, usually due to a shortage of staff or beds. Last July,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.3 million</span> patients were waiting for an operation – the highest figure in a decade.
During the winter, the system goes into crisis mode. Between December<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 163,000 patients</span> waited in corridors and ambulances for <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 30 minutes</span> before being admitted to the emergency room. To deal with the crunch, officials ordered hospitals to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cancel 50,000 operations</span>.
American patients will not stand for the higher taxes and lower-quality care that “Medicare-for-all” would bring. A majority of people,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55 percent</span>, erroneously believe that they'd be able to keep their private insurance under such a system. Once they learn it would eliminate private health insurance, support for the idea plummets, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 56 percent</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 37 percent</span>. The same happens after they learn it would require higher taxes.

Seven <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> say they'd oppose “Medicare-for-all” if it led to delays in getting some treatments and tests. Such delays are not hypothetical – they're endemic to single-payer.
Harris and her fellow Democrats may think “Medicare-for-all” is their ticket to the White House. But voters are not interested in their plan to eliminate private health insurance."

ARE DEMS</span> FINALLY READY TO TOSS PELOSI?
House Democrats and House Republicans have inverse problems.
The Republican rank and file is always full of grumbles about their leader, but nobody seems to want to step up and take him on.
Democrats, on the other hand, have plenty of eager usurpers ready to lead the mutiny, but the crew doesn’t seem interested. That may be changing.
In the wake of a mortifying performance before a CNN studio audience including a cringe-inducing response to a rape victim, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is having another bad day.
Rep. Linda Sanchez D-Calif., has joined the ranks of a growing number of Democratic members who say it’s time for 77-year-old Pelosi to hang it up.
In an appearance on C-SPAN, Sanchez said, “I do think we have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus and I do think it’s time to pass a torch to a new generation of leaders and I want to be a part of that transition.”
But like Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio and Rep. Seth Moulton D-Mass., it’s that last part – “I want to be a part of that transition” – that causes problems. Republicans depose first and pick new leaders later.
In the period of time that Pelosi has been the Democratic leader, Republicans have cycled through a basketball teams worth of House leaders. And if you’ve seen John Boehner lately you know why. The reason he’s smiling is because House leadership is a grueling ordeal for Republicans whose own members are beyond insubordinate. They’re just plain mean.
Democrats, on the other hand, are quite congenial with their leaders, so much so that they keep essentially the same team in power after loss, after loss, after loss, after loss.
If you think Paul Ryan would survive as party leader if Republicans lose the House next year you’ve been drinking too many Leinenkugels. But somehow, Pelosi has survived not only losing the majority, but also failing to retake it in three successive cycles.
Pelosi is no small part of why Democrats are in the House minority, to boot. She ran her caucus off a cliff when she was speaker, forcing votes on brutal issues like global warming regulations just to prove a point to the then Democratic president and Senate.
With little to offer and a demonstrable political reliability for Democrats <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> how does she manage to stay on?
Part of it is certainly her abilities to keep the right mix of contentment and fear within her leadership team. Her prodigious fundraising abilities don’t hurt either.
But what it comes down to is that Democrats keep trying to do their rebellions backwards.
Even on the occasions when Republicans had a plan of succession following the ouster or departure of a leader it didn’t work out.
There is a reason Kevin McCarthy hands out Chick-fil-A sandwiches instead of committee chairmanships.
You can blame some of the problems Republicans have had in majority on this defiant spirit, but there might not be any majority at all if it weren’t for it. The placidity of Pelosi’s reign is proof of that.
But if Democrats are beginning to care more about the revolution than who will lead it, she may at last be in for some real trouble.
THE RULEBOOK: GOTTA READ IT TO BELIEVE IT
“There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compose it; and to imply a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility, would be a still more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned, than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21
TIME</span> OUT: THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY
Smithsonian: “This morning, the Nobel Prize Committee announced British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro had become the 114th recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Ishiguro is the author of eight books, including 1989’s The Remains of the Day… Known to friends as ‘Ish,’ Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But the writer left Japan at the age of five when his father, an oceanographer, was offered a job in the United Kingdom.</span> [While] the setting and genres of Ishiguro’s work vary, the themes of memory, time and self-delusion have always been a constant. … ‘If you mix Jane Austen and Franz Kafka then you have Kazuo Ishiguro in a nutshell, but you have to add a little bit of Marcel Proust into the mix,’ Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said during the prize announcement. ‘Then you stir, but not too much, then you have his writings.’”

RUSSIAN HACKERS HIT NSA
The Hill: “Russian state hackers stole a collection of National Security Agency hacking tools and other documents from the personal computer of an agency contractor who had taken the classified documents home from work, reports The Wall Street Journal. The reported breach took place <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 but</span> wasn't discovered until spring of last year. The Journal reports that the hackers identified the documents through Kaspersky Lab antivirus software. The Department of Homeland Security recently barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky products due to security concerns but has been tight-lipped about what intelligence linked the popular, Moscow-based computer security firm to specific intelligence operations. White House cyber czar Rob Joyce has, however, repeatedly said that the Kaspersky Lab software's ability to access files on systems could be a potential way to compromise a system. Kaspersky has denied any involvement with covert government intelligence gathering, although it does work with police to aid in criminal investigations.”

A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller declined comment. The FBI also declined comment.

RYAN OPEN TO BANNING ‘BUMP STOCKS’ FOR RIFLES
Reuters: “U.S. lawmakers need to examine ‘bump stock’ gun accessories, devices that enable some guns to be turned into rapid-fire weapons, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryansaid on Thursday, opening the door to possible debate on gun control by the Republican-controlled Congress.</span> ‘Clearly that’s something we need to look into,’ Ryan told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, adding that many lawmakers had not been aware until now that such devices existed. An excerpt from the interview aired on MSNBC. … ‘I didn’t even know what they were until this week,’ Ryan said, referring to bump stocks. ‘I think we’re quickly coming up to speed with what this is.’ His remarks followed a call on Wednesday by the U.S. Senate’s No.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 Republican</span>, John Cornyn, for lawmakers to investigate bump stocks, as Democrats pushed for a ban on the devices.”
GOP senators consider legislation to ban gun devices - Politico: “Top Senate Republicans said Wednesday they are open to considering legislation banning devices that were reportedly used to gun down scores of people in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Bump stocks — also known as ‘slide fire’ devices, which work by rapidly ‘bumping’ the trigger of a semi-automatic weapon to boost the rate of fire — were reportedly used by Stephen Paddock to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">kill 58 people</span> and wound more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 in</span> Sunday’s Las Vegas massacre. No Republican has yet joined Democrats in endorsing a bill targeting bump stocks, but their comments suggest a potential shift in the party’s typically hard-line opposition to gun control measures. Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, has dispatched his staff to research the use of bump stocks and said it would be ‘worthwhile’ to have a hearing on the topic.”
Trump admin was already rolling back gun regulations - WaPo: “But, with less public attention, the Trump administration has eased some gun regulations in recent months. Among them: The Army Corps of Engineers has filed notice in a court case that it is reconsidering a ban on carrying firearms on its land; the Justice Department narrowed its definition of fugitives barred from purchasing weapons; and the Interior Department lifted a federal ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks. A White House official denied any deliberate effort to play down the change to the background-checks policy and declined to comment on that change or others related to guns.”
The Judge’s Ruling: How far is too far - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano battles the question of whether the government can keep us safe or not: “This is not a novel or arcane observation but rather a rational conclusion from knowing history and everyday life. … In America, killers use guns and only stop when they are killed by law-abiding civilians or by the police. The answer to government failure is a candid recognition that in a free society -- one in which we are all free to come and go as we see fit without government inquiry or interference -- we must be prepared for these tragedies.” More here.

FROM THE BLEACHERS
“I have long thought that, perhaps, the only real security solution in a free society is no security solution. That’s not to say that ordinary (and in some cases even extraordinary) security measures shouldn’t be taken to interdict the types of attacks we have seen since 9/11. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But at what cost – both monetary and psychic?</span> Nature has a way to deal with mass attacks in the ocean. It’s the school of fish approach. So, government should be watchful and we, the public, should be cautious; however the current reality is that every now and then the terrorist shark will be successful at gobbling up a few of us. And, like a school of fish, the vast majority will survive with our freedoms intact. I hope I’m not being too crass.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas
[Ed. note: I appreciate the fact that you are wrestling with this balance between freedom and order, as well as the fate of your fellow fish. It is essential for each of us to care deeply and love deeply our fellow human beings as individuals. The hard choices come in, however, when we think about human beings in large numbers. Either deliberately or as a result of unintended consequences, the choices about governments and the actions of those governments once constituted will be bad for some individuals. As we have often discussed, the purpose of a righteous government is to seek to create the proper balance between freedom and order so that human beings are able to realize their greatest potential. If there is too much order, the spirit of the people and their hopes will be crushed. If there is too much freedom, chaos will reign and people will be tyrannized by their neighbors. Fitting firearms into that equation is challenging, but not necessarily more challenging than issues like free speech, free assembly and free commerce. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Each of those things come at a cost to some people, sometimes unto death.</span> It’s not wrong to accept that there are consequences to some individuals as a result of freedom. But I would encourage you to keep a great heart for those little fish lost to our school. We should never be mathematically indifferent to human suffering.]
“The reason I read your halftime report every day is that I can trust you to speak the unvarnished truth. Your reply to Greg Cary [in Wednesday’s Halftime Report] cut through all the smoke. One of the proofs of the cowardice of our politicians is that none of them on either side will come out and say what, I believe, they mean i.e. that either they support the rights of American citizens to own guns to guard against the tyranny of the government (not for hunting, sport or self-defense against a criminal), or that they want to abolish the second amendment in order to disarm the public to promote that tyranny. I no longer own even a shotgun, but I hope enough of my fellow citizens own the most powerful weapons they can still get their hands on legally, to at least give the government pause before further infringing on our God given rights. I hope and pray that armed resistance to the government will never be necessary, but the safest way to assure that it won’t is for there to at least be some doubt what would happen if the government tried.” – Clark R. Acton, Anderson, Ind.
[Ed. note: If we have achieved the status of smoke cutters, then I will consider our work successful indeed. Thanks for reading and taking the time to write.]
“As you rightly pointed out, the Second Amendment, as defined by Mr. Madison, was to prevent such tyranny from arising here, in our newly founded republic. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Yes, the Civil War came about because virtually every man was armed (though weapons manufacturing had to increase as the supply of rifles and ammunition declined through use and wearing out).</span> However, after the war (and the Reconstruction) the rights of southern citizens be armed was returned to them. In the Old West (whatever that really was) a criminal, after surging a sentence (except for hanging sentences) had their weapons returned to them as they left either the risen or country jail or from prison. It wasn’t until the rise of the modern ‘organized criminal gang’ came into existence that ‘guns laws’ became an issue.” – John William Gibson, Coos Bay, Ore.
[Ed. note: Thank you for the history lesson, Mr. Gibson! We often discuss the way gun technology has changed since the founding, but we seldom talk about the way cultural changes have affected the way we see, use and regulate guns.]

ICED NOT ISIS
Fox News: “A 29-year-old man in Switzerland recently received an anonymous letter from his ‘worried’ neighbors after he hung a Jack Daniel’s flag in front of his apartment. Their problem? They mistook the whiskey brand’s logo for the black and white logo of ISIS, and feared the young man may be a supporter of the Islamic State. … According to the paper, the young man — who remained anonymous — had moved to Zurich with his girlfriend a few months back, and decided to hang the Italian flag and a Jack Daniel’s flag in front of his home because he thought it would be ‘funny.’ Now, however, he fears the neighbors have the wrong impression of him. … And as for his Jack Daniel’s flag? The man says he’s not taking it down. It wouldn’t be ‘right’ to give in, he said.”

High court overturns pre-internet precedent that limited tax collection
The Supreme Court handed states broad authority Thursday to require online retailers to collect sales taxes, overturning a pre-Internet court precedent that had effectively exempted many merchants from collection duties.
</span>The court, in a 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, ruled that states can require internet merchants to collect the taxes even if the merchant has no physical presence in the state.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The court cited studies suggesting that the current rule costs states up <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $33.9 billion</span> a year in uncollected sales taxes.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Justice Kennedy said the old rule “limited states’ ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.”
</span>The ruling likely will spell the end of an era in which consumers could save on taxes by purchasing goods online instead of from local merchants.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The justices’ decision overturned <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 high</span> court ruling involving mail-order businesses that said states can only require tax collection by merchants who are physically located in the state’s borders.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The ruling is a victory for states that argued tax-free internet sales were costing them billions of dollars in revenue.</span> It is also a big win for brick-and-mortar stores, which have to compete against online rivals that don’t have to collect the taxes on internet purchases.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 6</span>:54 pm ET

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said the Australian dollar's skid is far from over and recommended investors bet against the currency.

</span>The prediction, and pitch, were one of a slew Wednesday at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, where some of the world's best-known hedge-fund managers get <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 minutes</span> to make their best case for an investment idea or two. The annual conference, made famous by some presentations including David Einhorn'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2008 takedown</span> of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before it filed for bankruptcy protection, is a benefit that raises money for the treatment of pediatric cancer and other childhood illnesses.

Among the other pitches Wednesday: Steve Eisman touted U.S. home-building stocks, James Chanos made a bearish case against Seagate Technology PLC, STX -0.36%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Kyle Bass praised a yellow-pages company formed out of a merger of two recently bankrupt peers. Mr. Bass, who has profited from betting against the Japanese yen, also predicted the yen could decline to the ¥120-range against the dollar. Late Wednesday in New York, the dollar bought ¥99.02, compared with ¥99 late Tuesday.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Druckenmiller said he expects the Australian central bank will lower interest rates further, which will weigh on the value of the country's currency.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His prediction comes the day after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a record low and warned that the strong Australian dollar was hampering growth.

</span>""We think the Australian dollar...will come down and will come down hard,"" Mr. Druckenmiller said, while adding investors should avoid commodity currencies like Brazil and Canada. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Australian dollar, known as the Aussie, is trading near a two-month low and has dropped more <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% in</span> the past month.</span> Late Wednesday, the Aussie was <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.0171,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.0185 late</span> Tuesday.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">At a competing event, the SALT hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas, participants generally were upbeat about the U.S. economy and stock market, with a number comparing the environment to the late 1990s, when the country pulled ahead of other nations in economic growth.</span> However, some pointed to Japan as an area of profit for many hedge funds lately.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, in New York, Mr. Eisman, who made a fortune betting against the U.S. housing market in the past decade, has turned positive on U.S. housing but made a case that Canada is now replicating U.S. mistakes.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said he has stakes in Lennar Corp., Standard Pacific Corp. and PulteGroup Inc., saying that while home-building stocks are no longer cheap, some have yet to price in improved fundamentals.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He also called mortgage-finance company Ocwen Financial Corp. one of the best ways to bet on the U.S. market.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">As for Canada, Mr. Eisman painted a picture of misaligned government policy and support that has created a bubble in the country's housing market.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">While he didn't specify if he was betting against any stock, Mr. Eisman singled out for criticism mortgage originator Home Capital Group Inc., which trades in Toronto.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""If housing rolls over, this company is going to have problems,"" he said.</span> A representative for Home Capital Group couldn't be reached for comment.

On Seagate, Mr. Chanos didn't disclose if he had an actual wager against the company. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Among other things behind his thinking, he said, the business challenges facing personal computers were even more pronounced for hard-disk drives, a main Seagate product.</span> A representative for the company couldn't be reached.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Bass, fan of yellow-pages company Dex Media Inc., said that, while the directories business has had its problems, he sees this company as potentially benefiting from ""not printing as many books.""</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said he expects the company, with a market capitalization of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $234 million</span> (a figure that rose on his remarks), to expand its digital business and reduce its debt.

74724,"<h3>Maduro’s muscle: Politically backed motorcycle gangs known as 'colectivos' are the enforcers for Venezuela’s authoritarian leader</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">CARACAS, Venezuela — The neighbors were fed up.</span> For days, they’d had no electricity or running water because of a massive national blackout. So one morning this week, they piled logs and garbage into a makeshift barricade in their middle-class Caracas neighborhood and started yelling slogans against the government.
Then came the motorcycles.
There were at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 of</span> them, their motors buzzing, driven by men with scarves over their faces, according to interviews <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 10 witnesses</span>. The demonstrators scattered. But as people in surrounding buildings started hurling bottles at the bikers, the men raised their weapons — pistols and rifles — and opened fire.
No one was injured. But the neighbors were terrified.
“Now we can’t even protest, because they’ll shoot at us,” said Delia Arellano,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72,</span> one of the demonstrators.
The attack on Sunday was a chilling sign of how President Nicolás Maduro is increasingly relying on paramilitary groups as he clings to power. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This week, he publicly urged the motorcycle-riding “colectivos” to intensify their efforts, as the country teetered on the edge of economic collapse and a U.S.-backed opposition movement pressed for his ouster.
</span>“I call on the colectivos; the hour of resistance has arrived, active resistance in the community,” Maduro declared in the speech on Monday.
The colectivos aren’t nearly as big as Venezuela’s armed forces — they number <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perhaps 5,000 to</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,500 members</span> nationwide, most of them in cities, according to Alejandro Velasco, a history professor at New York University who has studied the phenomenon. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But they help explain how Maduro has remained in power even as the country’s economy and poorly maintained power grid have broken down.</span> The paramilitary forces are nimble and committed — and they have an extraordinary ability to sow terror.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">[Goodbye Venezuela: When U.S. Embassy staffers leave, they destroy documents and remove the flag]
Ingrid Maldonado witnessed Sunday’s clash between the neighbors and colectivos in Chacao, a business district of apartment buildings, offices and hotels in eastern Caracas.
</span>“Before, government repression just meant tear gas,” said Maldonado,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49.</span> “Now there are bullets. It’s different. You think twice about going out.”
The colectivos have their roots in the Cuban-inspired guerrilla forces that battled Venezuela’s staunchly anti-communist governments in the 1960s. After that conflict, some former rebels returned to poor neighborhoods determined to spread socialism through community activities — offering classes, showing movies, giving out free bread — and to protect residents from corrupt police.
Under the “Bolivarian revolution” of Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s predecessor, the number of these small armed groups grew. Some were permitted to control neighborhoods and run criminal rackets such as drug trafficking and extortion, analysts say. In return, they rounded up votes and provided other political support.
But Chávez, who ruled <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1999 until</span> his death <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> was popular. He wasn’t as dependent on the colectivos.
“He didn’t need to use violence,” said Rafael Uzcátegui, coordinator of the human rights group Provea. “Chávez could maintain political control of the country.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Maduro, in contrast, is widely reviled for the economic mismanagement that has brought hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine to this oil-rich nation.
</span>“That’s why resorting to violence and intimidation has been so important,” Uzcátegui said.
Venezuela’s Ministry of Communications did not respond to a request for comment.
[How Nicolás Maduro has been able to cling to power]
Over the past several years, a new kind of colectivo has emerged, composed of current or former police personnel or government bodyguards.
“Their primary allegiance is not to ‘chavismo’ or an ideological project or a radical leftist vision of change, but basically to stay in power,” Velasco said.
And “power,” for colectivos, often means access to government funds or goods. While it is difficult to pin down the groups’ exact ties to the state, some have been put in charge of the distribution of government food packages in poor areas — giving them control over hungry neighborhoods. Some might be paid by individuals in the government, analysts say.
The colectivos vary widely in their activities and organization. One group of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 black</span>-helmeted riders in dark clothing roars regularly through the colonial center of Caracas, near the Miraflores presidential palace, waving the giant red flags of the ruling Socialist party. They are an intimidating sight — even if they don’t flash their weapons.
Others don’t hesitate to threaten violence. Recently, a community activist in the poor Caracas neighborhood of La Vega was leaving a meeting about organizing a teachers strike. Armed men on motorcycles roared up and demanded to know what he was doing, said the activist, José Gregorio Velásquez. They warned him against closing off streets for protests. “We know where you live,” the men said, according to Velásquez.
That sort of grass-roots control could discourage poor Venezuelans from joining the protests that have swept the country in recent weeks in support of Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized by the United States and dozens of other countries as the legitimate president.
While middle-class Venezuelans turn out, Velasco said, “it’s difficult for Guaidó to have the barrios rise up. They are bearing the brunt of the oppression.”
[Has the Venezuelan opposition lost its momentum?]
The paramilitary groups are effective in part because they enjoy impunity. While the traditional colectivos were embedded in their communities, many of the newer ones aren’t, and it’s difficult for citizens to identify their members. They mask their faces, and their motorcycles often lack license plates. As political instability grows, even bands of car thieves or other criminals are calling themselves ‘colectivos,’ said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University.
“They fulfill the classic work of paramilitaries, doing violent security tasks that security agents in uniform would be held accountable for,” he said.
Perhaps the colectivos’ most important weapon, though, is their ability to sow fear.
Roberto Patiño, an opposition activist, helped lead demonstrations on Feb.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 in</span> the Venezuelan border city of Ureña aimed at pressuring security forces to allow humanitarian aid to cross from Colombia. When the Venezuelan National Guard launched tear gas, he said, the crowd persisted.
But then the colectivos turned up, firing their weapons.
“Most people fled to save themselves,” Patiño said. “There was a high risk of being killed.”
The colectivos have become particularly important as the government appears hesitant to use the army to put down demonstrations. While the military leadership has been loyal to Maduro, many rank-and-file soldiers are suffering the same hunger as other Venezuelans — and could defy orders.
The government has also turned to a relatively new branch of the national police, the Special Actions Force (known by its Spanish initials, FAES) to intimidate and kill young protesters in poor neighborhoods, according to human rights groups. Some activists say the new branch works closely with colectivos. The FAES says it is only going after criminals.
The clash in Chacao on Sunday was unusual in that it took place in wealthier East Caracas. Two bakery workers watched as neighbors threw up the barricade across Guaicaipuro Street at the intersection with a major avenue, Francisco de Miranda. At one point, a black government pickup truck tried to pass, the workers said, but the neighbors wouldn’t allow it.
About a half-hour later, the colectivo roared up and the protesters scattered. As residents of apartments yelled and tossed bottles at the motorcyclists, the workers said, the leader of the colectivo issued an order: “Let them have it.”
The motorcyclists opened fire, witnesses said, and eventually dismantled the barricade.
“I don’t think the neighbors of Chacao will go out again to protest,” said 18-year-old Ricardo Linares, one of the bakery workers.
“I’m not afraid to protest,” insisted Junaiker Martínez, a 19-year-old co-worker. “It’s the only power we have. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But I’m not going to go out there alone.”

71170,"<h3>Most REITs Have Dodged the Retail Storm So Far, Report Says</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Despite struggles at many U.S. malls, most of the retail REITs continue to maintain high occupancy rates

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 1,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:54 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The balance sheets of many of the largest U.S. mall owners have managed to dodge much of the carnage in the retail world caused by failing retailers, according to a new report by Moody’s Investors Service.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Struggling retailers like Sears Holdings Corp. and Toys R Us Inc. account for <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 3.9% of</span> the total leasable space in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 22 retail</span> real-estate investment trusts that Moody’s tracks.</span> Only two REITs tracked by Moody’s—CBL & Associates and Washington Prime—face an exposure of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10%,</span> a level the ratings company deems to be “significant.”

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">What’s more, most of the retail REITs continue to maintain high occupancy rates and rent space for average rents that are above the rents in expiring leases, Moody’s said.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Failing retailers have limited impact on rated retail REITs’ operating performance, with the effects concentrated in weak malls,” the report said.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Retail property has been the pariah of the real-estate industry in recent years as online competition has siphoned away business.</span> Mall and shopping center landlords have suffered overall as many of the biggest retailers have failed or contracted.

But the Moody’s report illustrates that some landlords are being hurt more than others. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The average occupancy rate for the retail REITs rated by the firm <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeded 96% at</span> the end <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017,</span> the report said.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We’re not saying we’re bullish on retail.</span> By no means,” said Philip Kibel, a Moody’s associate managing director. “We’re saying from a credit perspective, we’re not as concerned with these [REITs].”

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">That is largely because many of their properties are in strong locations that still enjoy high demand from retailers.</span> Through smart management, landlords can use their top properties to fuel leasing at more vulnerable properties, the report points out.

“REITs can help their weaker tenants by strategically relocating stores to shopping centers with greater traffic,” the report said. This tactic gives REITs the ability “to negotiate with tenants to keep stores open in less robust locations and reduce vacancies.”

Also some expanding retailers are making up for those that are struggling traditional big box and anchor stores. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Replacement tenants include movie theaters and other “experience-oriented” tenants and off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less, Moody’s said.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Of course, not all is cheery even among the stronger retail REITs.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">For one thing, stock investors have tended to paint the entire sector with a broad brush.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">As of Tuesday, mall and strip center REITs were trading <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 21.6% and</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.5% discounts</span> to the value of their assets, according to Green Street Advisors.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The overall REIT market was at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 8.5% discount</span>, the firm said.

</span>At the same time, some of the rental growth among the Moody’s rated malls has slowed. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> the so-called “leasing spread”—the difference between the average rent in new leases versus expiring leases—<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 9.6%.</span> That was down from <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 11.1% those</span> REITs chalked up <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

Moody’s downgraded its credit rating of CBL in February and changed its rating outlook of Washington Prime to negative from stable in <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017.</span> “There’s a big difference between them and Simon [Properties],” Mr. Kibel said.

But Moody’s pointed out that many REITs have shored up their balance sheets by reducing leverage. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That, coupled with positive cash flow, “will provide the REITs with financial flexibility to develop and redevelop their portfolios to attract tenants,” the report said.

36334,"<h3>Imran Khan Declares Victory In Disputed Pakistan Election</h3>ISLAMABAD, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26 </span>(Reuters) - Pakistani cricket legend Imran Khan declared victory on Thursday in a divisive general election, and said he was ready to lead the nuclear-armed nation despite a long delay in ballot counting and allegations of vote-rigging from his main opponents.

His success in Wednesday’s election is a stunning rise for an anti-corruption crusader who has spent much of his political career on the fringes of Pakistan politics, but now stands on the brink of becoming the country’s prime minister.

“God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology which I <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">started 22 years</span> ago,” Khan,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 65,</span> said in a televised speech from his house near the capital Islamabad.

Supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who accuse Khan of colluding with the still powerful army, said the vote count was rigged in what it termed an assault on democracy in a country with a history of military rule.

Oxford-educated Khan, in the past a fierce critic of U.S. policy in the region, called for “mutually beneficial” ties with Pakistan’s on-off ally the United States, and offered an olive branch to arch-foe India, saying the two nations should resolve their long-simmering dispute over Kashmir.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">In a speech peppered with populist pledges, Khan promised to create jobs for the poor and said he would turn the palatial prime minister’s official residence in the capital into an education facility instead of living in it.

</span>With about half the votes counted, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice, had a wide lead in the Muslim-majority nation, the country’s election commission said.

Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and rival Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) both said their party monitors at many voting centers were either kicked out during counting or had not received the official notifications of the precinct’s results, instead being given handwritten tallies they could not verify.

“It is a sheer rigging. The way the people’s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,” Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N president and Nawaz’s brother, told a news conference.

Khan has staunchly denied allegations by PML-N that he is getting help from the military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its history and still sets key security and foreign policy.

The army, which dismisses allegations of meddling, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">deployed 371,000 soldiers</span> at polling stations across the country, nearly five times the number as in last election <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013.</span>

Khan offered to investigate all the allegations of rigging and said he wants to “unite” the country under his leadership.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Pakistan faces a mounting economic crisis that is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the likely conditions of which could complicate Khan’s spending pledges.</span> PTI has also not ruled out seeking succor from China, Islamabad’s closest ally which has in recent years been investing heavily in infrastructure in the country.

Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) secretary Babar Yaqoob told reporters early on Thursday that counting had been delayed by technical failures in an electronic reporting system and the tallying was now being conducted manually. The results had been due by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2 a</span>.m. (2100 GMT on Wednesday).

By early Thursday evening, a full day after polls closed, he told <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reporters 82 percent</span> of results had been received and rejected the allegations of tampering in the vote count.

“The complaints we have been receiving, they could be of procedural level, but not any kind of rigging,” Yaqoob said.

<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">With 48 percent</span> of the total vote counted, Khan’s PTI was listed by the ECP in its provisional results as leading <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 113 of</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 272 contested</span> National Assembly constituencies.

Sharif’s PML-N was ahead <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 64 constituencies</span>, and the PPP, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, led <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 42 constituencies</span>.

Although Khan still appeared likely to fall short of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 137 seats</span> needed for a majority in the National Assembly, he should have no problems finding coalition partners from smaller parties and independents.

Pakistan’s election monitoring body and the European Union’s were scheduled to deliver their assessments of the conduct of the election on Friday.

An icon of Pakistani cricket and a one-time London playboy who has since transformed himself into a pious, firebrand nationalist, Khan’s campaign speeches were littered with anti-America rhetoric and baiting of India.

But in his victory speech, Khan pledged to improve ties with Washington and Pakistan’s neighbors at a time the country is becoming increasingly isolated over its alleged links with Islamist militants in Afghanistan.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">He called for a “balanced relationship” with the United States, which has taken a firmer line on Pakistan under President Donald Trump, suspending aid and even convincing Western allies to putPakistan on a terror financing watchlist earlier this year.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Quipping that Indian media had recently portrayed him like a “villain in a Bollywood movie,” Khan’s overtures to New Delhi included calls for better trade ties and to sit down and discuss Kashmir, a disputed region that was the cause of two of the three wars between the neighbors.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Khan also said he wants deepen ties with old ally Beijing and emulate China’s success in reducing poverty.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Investors welcomed Khan’s election success, with Pakistan’s benchmark 100-share index surging as much <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1.9 percent</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 42,136 points</span> in early trade, before <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closing 1.8 percent</span> up.</span> Analysts said there was relief Khan was unlikely to have to rely on major opposition parties in a messy coalition.

Khan has promised an “Islamic welfare state” and cast his campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished nation <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 208 million</span>, where the illiteracy rate hovers <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 40 percent</span>.

“Accountability will start with me, then my ministers, and then we will work our way down,” Khan said. “I want all of Pakistan to be united in this moment.”
