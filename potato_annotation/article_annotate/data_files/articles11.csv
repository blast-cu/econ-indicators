26571,"<h3>Coronavirus: Trump stands by China lab origin theory for virus</h3>Coronavirus: Trump stands by China lab origin theory for virus
US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.
Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began.
But the office said it had determined Covid-19 ""was not manmade or genetically modified"".
China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19.
Since emerging in China last year, the virus has <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 230,000 people</span> worldwide <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 63,000 in</span> the US.
The pandemic has seen at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 3.2 million</span> people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan.
What did Trump say?
At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: ""Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?""
""Yes, I have. Yes, I have,"" said the president, without specifying. ""And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.""
Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.""
He also told reporters: ""Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose?
""I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.""
The New York Times reported on Thursday that senior White House officials had asked the US intelligence community to investigate whether the virus came from a Wuhan research laboratory.
Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News.
What did the intelligence service say?
In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins.
- <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea?
- China and the US trade coronavirus conspiracy theories
""The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.</span>""
It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon.
What is the Wuhan lab?
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Level 4 lab</span>oratory</span>.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats.
Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports.
It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Level 4 lab</span> with links to similar labs around the world.
What are Trump's accusations against China?
Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing.
On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November.
He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading.
He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body.
China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis.
A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations.
</span>How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before?
In January, he called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea.
His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign.
He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens.
The right moment for this fight?
President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead.
Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight.
China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game.
</span>Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.

It’s a close call, but most private economists polled think the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates pinned near zero next week.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 46% of</span> business and academic economists surveyed over the past week by The Wall Street Journal predicted the Fed’s first rate increase would come at the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting.</span> While a plurality picked September, a majority predicted liftoff would arrive at some later meeting. <span id=""2"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 9.5% said</span> the Fed would lift off in October, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 35% said</span> the first rate increase would come in December <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 9.5% said</span> the central bank would wait <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2016.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Expectations for an imminent Fed rate increase have fallen sharply in the past few weeks.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In early August,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 82% of</span> economists thought the Fed would raise rates in September.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Just 3% saw</span> the first move coming in October,<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13% predicted</span> a December liftoff, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2% saw</span> officials waiting until next year.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“What’s keeping the Fed from lifting rates is not the U.S. economy, which is actually doing quite well,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group LLC.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He predicted a September liftoff in last month’s survey but now thinks the Fed will wait until December.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It’s the worry that a sharp slowdown in China will devastate emerging countries enough to drag down global economic growth, and that may ultimately impact the U.S. too.”

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">There remains a decent chance the Fed could still act next week, economists said.</span> On average, forecasters estimated the probability of a September rate increase <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 42%.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">By comparison, futures markets—where traders make bets on the Fed policy outlook—signal only <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 24% chance</span> of the Fed raising rates this month, CME Group said Thursday.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., said he thinks the Fed will start raising rates in October, but still gave <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 45% chance</span> of a move in September.</span> “It’s a close call, but I do think they haven’t really definitively set markets up for this,” he said. “By a narrow margin, we’re likely to see no change—but a policy statement that’s very focused on a near-term rate rise, if everything goes according to plan.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">A third of economists said the likelihood of a Fed rate increase next week was <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 50%.</span></span> Even among forecasters who said September was the most likely month for liftoff, the probability of a move averaged <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 53%.</span>

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">”For a lot of people like me, September has been the least unlikely time to start for quite a while,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.</span> But he only attached <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 45% probability</span> to liftoff next week. “It would be difficult to have confidence in either direction,” he said.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The Journal <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">polled 64 private</span> forecasters Friday through Wednesday, though not every economist answered every question.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">At the beginning <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span> most economists thought the Fed would raise rates by midyear.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">After an economic slowdown in the first quarter, predictions for the first rate increase coalesced around September.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But turbulence in financial markets and worries about China’s economic slowdown raised doubts in recent weeks about whether the Fed is ready to begin raising its benchmark federal-funds rate, which has been pinned near zero since <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2008.</span>

</span>“All of the data that we have had up until now has been, I think, encouraging. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">It...has been about as good, or better, than I was expecting, in terms of the U.S. economy,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said in an interview with the Journal.</span> “But there are some pretty significant—and I would say have now grown larger—headwinds that have developed.”

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">There was little sign that Fed officials were near agreement on raising rates ahead of the policy meeting that will begin Wednesday and conclude on Thursday.

</span>Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley in August said a September rate increase “seems less compelling to me than it did several weeks ago.”

But other policy makers, like Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker, have appeared eager to start. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“I’m not arguing that this economy is perfect by any means, but nor is it on the ropes, requiring the stimulus of low monetary policy interest rates to get it back into the ring,” Mr. Lacker said last week.

37311,"<h3>Miner Freeport Pressured by Water Costs as Copper Prices Slide</h3>Companies Spend Billions on Water as They Probe Remote, Dry Areas for Increasingly Scarce Minerals

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 20,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 10</span>:32 pm ET

MORENCI, Ariz.—Two years ago, Freeport-McMoRan Inc., FCX -2.55%decrease; red down pointing triangle one of the world's top copper miners, paid 69-year-old cowboy Richard <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kaler $1.3 million</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 280 acres</span> of rocky ranchland in the eastern Arizona desert.

Freeport isn't interested in his minerals. Instead, it wants his rights to fresh water, which it needs to expand production at North America's biggest copper mine, spread <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 65,000 acres</span> nearby. Freeport aims to unearth almost one billion pounds of copper a year—37% of current U.S. annual output—at the Morenci, Ariz., mine <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2016.</span>

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The success of the Phoenix-based miner, which had profit <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.7 billion</span> on revenue <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $20.9 billion</span> last year, hinges on its ability to secure and maintain water supplies in arid areas where copper is found.</span> It requires heavy spending and delicate negotiations to minimize potential conflicts with local farmers and others who also need water.

It's not alone. As mining companies probe remote areas for increasingly scarce minerals, they are investing billions of dollars for water. Moody's Investors Service estimates that mining companies <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $12 billion</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> three times as much <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 2009,</span> on water management, including treatment facilities and pipelines.

The issue is especially crucial for copper. Around half the world's copper comes from a belt running from Utah to Chile under mountainous, dry areas, and costs for water are expanding. The Chilean parliament is considering forcing mining companies to build desalinization plants, which remove salt from ocean water, rather than use fresh ground and surface water for their operations. BHP Billiton Ltd., another top copper producer, and its partners agreed to build <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3.43 billion</span> desalinization plant for its massive copper mine in Chile's Atacama desert. Freeport in Chile recently completed <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $315 million</span> desalinization plant and pipeline. And in Peru, it is building <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $340 million</span> sewage treatment plant.

""Water is a critical issue in places like Northern Chile and Southern Peru, and here in New Mexico and Arizona,"" Freeport Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Water management costs are adding to pressure on copper miners amid a slide in prices—<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 32% since</span> highs reached in 2011—deflated by weaker demand, especially in China.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 a</span> pound, prices are still higher than Freeport's extraction costs in North America <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.87 a</span> pound, and up from prices that hovered <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $1.50 a</span> pound in the 1990s.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Analysts say copper prices are relatively resilient, because quality deposits are limited and the metal is essential to a wide variety of goods, from water pipes to iPhones.</span> Analysts say Freeport isn't at risk of having to close mines for lack of water, but having to increase spending on water could drive up miners' costs.

China, the world's second-largest copper producer <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1.65 million</span> tons a year <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> has tripled production <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2003.</span> The country doesn't have water problems in its copper-mining areas. No.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 producer</span> Chile, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5.7 million</span> tons a year, has increased <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">output 17% in</span> that time.

Production growth in the U.S., the world's fourth-largest copper producer <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 1.22 million</span> tons <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> has been flat in the past decade. Two-thirds of that annual output is pulled from Arizona.

Freeport's Morenci mine and its other four mines in Arizona <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produce 30% of</span> the company's copper output, and all are at risk of losing currently available water supplies. If they do, Freeport would be forced ""to curtail operations, preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs,"" the company said in a February SEC filing.

In the U.S., mineral extraction consumes around four billion gallons of water a day. For comparison, industry <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">uses 18.2 billion</span> gallons, all domestic households <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">use 29.4 billion</span> and agriculture <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">uses 128 billion</span> gallons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's most recent survey published <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span></span>

Context is important, though. ""It's not that mining companies use a lot of water, but they tend to mine in rocky places without a lot of water,"" said Mike Lacey, the director of water resources for Arizona.

Water is needed to control dust kicked up during open-pit mining and to extract minerals from rock using various flotation methods in which minerals float or sink.

As most available minerals are taken, what is left tends to be of lower grade, meaning that more rocks must be extracted and more water used to process them. ""If you <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extract 100,000 tons</span> of raw copper <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 0.2% instead</span> <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2% grade</span> copper, you <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">need 10 times</span> as much rock <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 10 times</span> as much water,"" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein. ""Water is one of the biggest things mining companies have to worry about, and it's going to get worse.""

Water's scarcity in Arizona has drawn mining companies into conflict with other big consumers of water, mainly farms. In Saharuita, near Tucson, Green Valley Pecan Co., one of the world's largest pecan farms and one of the state's biggest water consumers, has filed legal motions to try to block Canada's Augusta Resource Corp. from building a planned mine. ""It would be adding new, unlimited use of water,"" said Nan Walden, vice president of Green Valley Pecan. ""We're all going to have to pay more for water,"" but a new copper mine added to the two others nearby, including one owned by Freeport, would exhaust supplies, she said.

Augusta Resource says it is minimizing water impact with a new tailings method, planting grass and grazing cattle, and by building <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $22 million</span> water pipeline into the mine <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9 miles</span> away. ""We want zero net impact on the local aquifer,"" said spokesman Dan Ryan.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mines' voracious appetite for water drives up prices and occasionally pollutes local water supplies, said Roger Featherstone, director of the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, an environmental and mining watchdog group.</span> ""But mining companies always have a way of getting the water they need,"" he adds.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Freeport's Mr. Adkerson said managing water sustainably for the surrounding community and preventing pollution ""are just as important as the technical aspects of our business.</span>""

Morenci, a dusty mining outpost <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4,000 set</span> among cactuses and mesquite, receives an average <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 inches</span> of rainfall a year, compared <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 40 inches</span> for New York. Residents say all but one piece of property—a small bar—in the little community is owned and controlled by Freeport. Everything else, from the RadioShack and the motel to the Chinese restaurant and the pizza parlor, is on Freeport land. There is no mayor.

Two of Freeport's principal strategies in Arizona, it says, are buying private farmland, and cutting water-rights deals with local Native American tribes.

""It's a question of finding ways we can make an arrangement for [Native Americans] to give us access to some of their unused water rights,"" said Mr. Adkerson. In January, Freeport hired the state's former water director to help secure rights.

For decades, Freeport and its predecessor company, Phelps Dodge, have had agreements to buy water rights from the San Carlos Apache tribe, which is centered in the town of San Carlos about two hours from the mine. <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 15,000</span>-member tribe <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">occupies 1.8 million</span> acres in southeastern Arizona and is one of the poorest communities in the nation with median household income <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $27,000 a</span> year.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">In <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2013,</span> as part of its latest pact, Freeport agreed to pay the tribe <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $43 million</span> to help Freeport ""increase its water supply <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 75,000 acre</span>-feet"" in total, according to documents the tribe shared with The Wall Street Journal.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The deal means Freeport has the right to use that amount of water, which is enough to <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cover 75,000 acres</span> of land with a foot of water and can supply a normal-size copper mine for three years, according to mining engineers.</span> Freeport declined to comment on the deal, citing a confidentiality agreement. Tribal chairman Terry Rambler declined to add further details about the deal.

Freeport also committed to <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">training 16 Apaches</span> every month for three years for its Morenci, Safford and Miami mines, and helped convert a local school into a training center—the football field is now stacked with bales of hay that are used to train people to use Caterpillar forklifts.

The training plan would amount to <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 550 people</span>, but few San Carlos Apaches end up among <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2,900 who</span> work at the Morenci mine. The two-hour drive to Morenci makes it expensive and cumbersome to get to work there, say tribe members.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Alexander Baylish,<span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> completed the course and quickly found a job working in smelter maintenance for Freeport <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $17 an</span> hour.</span> He currently works at the Miami mine, which is <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 40 minutes</span> away, meaning he can live at home, where he has four children. He said others working at the Morenci mine only come home on weekends. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""This is the best job you can get around here,"" he said.</span> ""A quarter of the people taking classes don't have high-school degrees.""

In addition, Freeport said it has paid <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $81 million</span> <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 23,000 acres</span> in the past five years ""for the primary purpose of acquiring water rights."" Arizona law allows mining companies to use as much groundwater as they can, and then allocates water from rivers and lakes based on how much landowners have used in the past. After Freeport transfers the land's water rights to the mine, it leases the acreage to farmers and ranchers.

Mr. Kaler, the 69-year-old rancher, was a career phone technician from Illinois when he bought his ranch along the San Francisco River <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002.</span> He rode horses and learned how to herd cattle. ""After my whole life of dreaming about it, I finally became a cowboy,"" he said.

<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> when copper prices jumped, Freeport asked him if he wanted to sell.</span> Mr. Kaler said <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 90 acre</span>-feet of water a year attached to his plot of land were especially valuable because they were essentially permanent—they predated Arizona statehood <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1912 and</span> thus couldn't be lost in a legal challenge.

Mr. Kaler was on the fence, but after his wife was killed in a car accident <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> he decided to sell. Freeport paid <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">him $1.3 million</span>, according to county records, which he used to buy another ranch. He also leased his old land back from Freeport, and uses both ranches to farm <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 head</span> of organic Angus beef cattle. ""I'm still a cowboy,"" he said.

95268,"<h3>Gays can be reformed, just like arsonists, Trump’s new domestic policy adviser has said</h3>Ken Blackwell, tapped last week by President-elect Donald Trump to head domestic policy during the businessman's transition to the White House, has made anti-LGBT statements for years. Among them: Homosexuality is a sin, and gay people, just like petty thieves and fire-setters, can be rehabilitated.
The Ohio politician has long endorsed a controversial mental health practice known as conversion therapy or reparative therapy. The goal is to cure a person of his or her homosexuality, and in the case of transgender people, to reaffirm the gender into which they were born.
In the past, treatments have included everything from inducing vomiting to using mild electric shock while patients viewed homoerotic images. Since the 1990s, however, the therapy has been denounced by many medical and scientific societies and even outlawed in a handful of states. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span></span> the Obama administration expressed disapproval of the practice after Leelah Alcorn, a 17-year-old transgender teen in Ohio, took her life after being forced by her parents to undergo conversion counseling.
While Blackwell will be overseeing a wide swath of domestic issues facing the new administration, one big question facing the LGBT community is whether a Trump administration will promote the discredited therapy.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Two years ago, in a radio interview with Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Blackwell appeared to blame the deaths of six individuals in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2014 mass</span> shooting in Isla Vista, Calif., on the LGBT rights movement, saying it undermined ""natural marriage.</span>""
""When these fundamental institutions are attacked and destroyed and weakened and abandoned,"" said Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, ""you get what we are now seeing, and that is a flood of these disturbed people in our society that are causing great pain.""

In an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006,</span> the former Ohio secretary of state claimed that being gay was a “choice” that could be “changed.”
“I think it's a transgression against God's law,” he told the Columbus Dispatch at the time. “And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one's genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think they can be changed? Yes.”
And <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> on Michelangelo Signorile's radio show, Blackwell reaffirmed his stance, saying, ""People choose to be who they are, as they choose to break civil law and God's law. ... I think you can choose not to be homosexual.""
The American Psychiatric Association de-pathologized homosexuality <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> when it was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Other professional groups quickly followed suit:
- <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1975,</span> the American Psychological Association urged its members to help remove the stigma of illness from gay people.
- <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1981,</span> the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses.
- <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1994,</span> the American Medical Association released a report calling for “nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation.”
- And on <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 26,</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> in Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of same-sex marriage, writing that being gay was “a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable.”

Vice President-elect Mike Pence has also appeared to support conversion therapy. When he was running for Congress <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000,</span> Pence's website declared that money set aside by the federal CARE Act, to help indigent HIV/AIDS patients, also be ""directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" (The Trump transition team has not responded for a request for comment.)
<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> freelance investigative journalist John Becker went undercover and secretly filmed a conversion therapy session at a Christian counseling clinic run by Marcus Bachmann, husband of former Minnesota representative Michele Bachmann.
Experts around the world have condemned conversion therapy as not only lacking empirical validity but as unhealthy, especially for young people, causing depression, anxiety, addiction and even suicide.
At least five states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation forbidding mental health professionals from offering conversion therapy to minors. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled that a conversion therapy group called JONAH had violated the state's consumer protection statute by fraudulently advertising a cure for being gay.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The judge also found the group's business practices ""unconscionable.""</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As part of the settlement, in which JONAH was ordered to pay more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3.5 million</span> in legal fees and damages, the organization also was forced out of business and its therapists barred from practicing or even promoting conversion therapy in New Jersey.

Douglas Haldeman, a psychologist in Seattle, has written frequently on the topic. The term “reparative therapy” “inaccurately implies 'broken-ness' as the distinctive feature of homosexuality and bisexuality,” he wrote in the book ""Homosexuality: Research Implications for Public Policy."" <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The promotion of reparative or conversion therapy goes beyond its obvious market of disaffected lesbian, gay and bisexual people.</span> This campaign attempts to influence public opinion and justify anti-gay discrimination by inaccurately portraying homosexuality as a mental disorder and a social evil.

<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1999,</span> a report titled “Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation” was released specifically denouncing reparative therapy as having little or no effectiveness and instead contributing to discrimination against LGBT people.

10514,"<h3>N.C. GOP Governor Closes Polling Gap as Transgender Demand Mobilizes Conservative Voters</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">North Carolina’s GOP governor has closed a 5-point polling gap with his Democratic rival in the last two weeks, as voters push back against the Democrats’ use of the transgender bathroom controversy to tarnish the governor’s successful economic record.
</span>On Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Gov. Pat McCrory was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 44.2 percent</span>, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 3.6 points</span> behind Attorney General Roy Cooper, according to Real Clear Polling’s average of polling results. Almost three weeks later, on Oct.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> McCrory was half a point behind <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 46.3 percent</span>, and climbing fast.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Local GOP officials are eager to credit McCrory’s economic record for the rise.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“As we get down to the final days of the election and voters have to make a decision about who they want to be governor, they are realizing that the governor has been doing his job and getting results while the attorney general hasn’t <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 years</span>,” said the governor’s spokesman, Ricky Diaz.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Governor McCrory’s rise in the polls is not surprising when you consider that North Carolina has the fastest growing economy in the nation, people are keeping more of their hard-earned money from the generous tax cuts including those for the middle class and small business owners, and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 300,000 new</span> sustainable jobs have been created over the last four years,” said a statement from Kami Mueller, communications director at the North Carolina Republican Party.
</span>But McCrory is also gaining in the polls because he’s gradually stood up to defend the state’s civic society against the Democrats’ use of the “transgender rights” claim to help their long-term goal of barring government officials from recognizing the biological and social differences between boy and girls, men and women.
Conservatives are rallying to McCrory’s defense of normal society, “as they have the opportunity to hear [him, because] the media has refused to tell the story,” says Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.
“I don’t agree with the concept of redefining gender — that is major societal change, but it is being passed off as a political battle,” McCrory told a group of pastors at an Oct.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7 meeting</span> hosted by the Family Research Council.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve had to do a lot of study on this… I’d never heard of it,” until gay advocates threatened to hammer the state’s economy and to spend millions of campaign dollars against him, unless he rejected the state legislation which affirms the difference between men and women.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Conservatives in the state need to rise up against this gender ideology, despite growing pressure by the media, business groups, Democrats, and transgender-sympathetic friends, he said.
</span>The radicals “have the media on their side, and they have a lot of [public] support because people don’t understand the issue” behind the call for transgender bathrooms, he said. “You’re going to have be direct in informing people about this, because [gay activists and the media] are confusing everybody,” he said.
“The silent majority had got to quit being silent [and] you have four weeks to do it,” he said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Since <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016,</span> gay advocacy groups have organized a national economic boycott of the state, supposedly to protect the right of transgender people to use the bathrooms they prefer.
</span>However, that push for transgender rights is only part of the opposition to the so-called “HB2” privacy and security law.
The HB2 law preserves routine distinctions between men and women in school and public bathrooms and locker rooms by overriding a city ordinance in Charlotte which said people who are transgender — regardless of appearance, therapy, or biology — can use either the male or female public bathrooms.
The law is a compromise because its says that people who want to use public toilets and locker-rooms in the state must use the facility reserved for their male or female sex — but it also allows transgender people to use the opposite sex’s facilities once they’ve undergone surgery and legally changed the sex on their birth certificate.
Nationally, only about one in <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 2,400 Americans</span> have changed their name from one sex to another, according to a recent study of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 census</span>. Even pro-transgender advocates say that only one in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 160 Americans</span> fit into a very broad definition of “transgender.”
That compromise is anathema to gay activists because it legislatively reinforces what they describe as “the gender binary,” which is academic jargon for the public’s view that society consists of male and female, with only a few mixed-sex people in between.
But gay and feminist activists really want legislators, judges, scientists, and schools to suppress the idea that society consists of just males and females. The activists instead want a society where the government forces Americans to recognize and praise so many types of gender identities and sexual orientations that there just isn’t any normal type of sexual identity. That want that goal because if there’s no normal, there’s no reason for society to favor and praise the normal heterosexual men and women who jointly create each new generation of Americans.
But without the assumption that men and women are normal, distinct, and different, many evolved civic rules would become political battlegrounds in North Carolina and all of the United States.
Single-sex bathrooms and locker-rooms; single-sex sports leagues and women’s shelters; free speech, law enforcement, and social cooperation; science education, parental guidance of children’s sexual development and health — all become new political battlegrounds if government officials treat people’s self-declared “gender identity” as more legally important than their biological sex.
The push to bury the idea of normal sexuality “sends a confusing message to children,” said Perkins.
It is problematic when you starting going into elementary or junior schools telling kids there’s no difference between gender … kids are going through puberty, which is almost like going through re-entry from space — they’re disoriented, they’re confused about a lot of things — and to say that [teenage moods are] permanent, that it is problematic because it prevents the kids from going through the normal stages of life to normal maturity.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Since this summer, gay activists have persuaded numerous business allies and the university presidents who run sports leagues to cancel investments and sports tournaments in North Carolina.</span> McCrory has repeatedly blamed the boycott on his rival, Roy Cooper. “He’s promoting the boycott,” McCrory told the pastors.
Cooper has also received extensive donations from gay activists, including activists in New York, as well as a flood of activists and media support from gay groups.
Also, President Barack Obama and his deputies in the Department of Justice are trying to help Cooper.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In May, he weighed in with threats to cut federal school and transportation funding unless the state’s voters agreed to the federal demand that a person can freely and frequently change their declared sex, regardless of biology.</span> “Transgender men are men — they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women — they live, work and study as women,” Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 9.</span>
In her campaign visits to the state, Clinton also slams McCrory for support of the law that preserves the distinctions between male and female. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In September, according to the Charlotte Business Journal, Clinton told her state supporters that:
HB2 is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn’t have any place in our modern society,” Clinton said during her speech at Johnson C. Smith.</span> “You see this first-hand in North Carolina. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Discrimination is not only wrong, it’s bad for business.</span> The NBA, you know, canceled the (All-Star) game. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">PayPal <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">canceled 400 jobs</span> (in Charlotte).</span> Others are not coming to this beautiful state. Because they don’t want to be associated with the discriminatory, bigoted policies of your governor and legislature.
That pro-transgender pitch is a close match for the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Clinton 2016 campaign</span>, Perkins told Breitbart News. “This ties right into Hillary Clinton and her campaign and the entire left’s disdain for people who believe their faith is something to guide their lives by,” he said. “It goes back to her description [of conservatives] as ‘a basket of deplorables,’” he said.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Polls show that Obama-backed gender ideology is very unpopular — but it is largely overshadowed by the media’s effort to blame McCrory for the economic boycott of the state.
</span>Cooper was also aided by the Justice Department’s decision to launch an investigation of McCrory’s administration. The investigation led nowhere, and was quietly shut down, but it gave Cooper a talking point for the Oct.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 candidate</span>’s debate. McCrory quickly knocked that claim down, and the federal officials admitted the next day that the previously secret investigation had ended without charges — but the episode allowed the federal Democrats and local media to further hammer McCrory.
McCrory and other GOP officials are now charging Cooper with breaking privacy laws by announcing the secret investigation during the debate.
“Roy Cooper showed the true depths of his ineptitude by his willingness to do or say anything for his own political gain,” said GOP spokeswoman Mueller. “As the state’s top law enforcement officer and attorney, Cooper egregiously broke laws of ethics and rules of the North Carolina State Bar in his drive-by attempt to defame the sitting Governor of North Carolina,” she said.
“Roy Cooper has been an embarrassment as North Carolina’s attorney general for the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 16 years</span>, and his performance in the last debate solidified he would be just as embarrassing and inept if he were to be elected governor,” she added.

BENTON COUNTY, Ark.—When Barb Strickert married, she and her husband wrote down a one-year plan for their lives together. And a three-year plan. Five- and 10-year plans, too.

Their meticulous mapping of the future eventually culminated in The Retirement Plan. Barb would leave the corporate world in her early 60s and run a small bed-and-breakfast on their 11-acre wooded plot in the Ozark Mountains. She and her husband, Brian, would convert the garage into a recording studio to promote local musicians.

The best-laid plans of Barb and Brian have gone awry. One bedroom of the would-be B&B, in their walkout basement, is now occupied by Barb’s 83-year-old mother, and the other by her 34-year-old daughter. Barb has <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 64,</span> and, thanks to her new responsibilities, can no longer afford to quit.

“I was hoping to be retired by the age I’m at now,” she says. “That’s not going to happen. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">I’m going to work until I can’t do the job.”

</span>There is a growing number of baby boomers who find themselves caring for both their elderly parents and their adult children, rather than kicking back at retirement age. They face the strain of constant caregiving and derailed dreams, as well as added expenses. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It’s one more reason why many Americans are entering their retirement years as unprepared financially as any generation in years.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2014 study</span> by the Pew Research Center <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 52% of</span> U.S. residents in their 60s—17.4 million people—are financially supporting either a parent or an adult child, up <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 45% in</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span></span> Among them, <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1.2 million</span> support both a parent and a child, more than double the number a decade earlier, according to an analysis of the Pew findings and census data.

The squeeze is coming from both ends. With lifespans growing longer, the number of 60-somethings with living parents has more than doubled <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1998,</span> to <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 million</span>, according to an Urban Institute analysis of University of Michigan data, and they are increasingly expensive to care for. At the same time, many boomers are helping their children deal with career or health problems, or are sharing the heavy burden of student loans.

Barb Strickert’s retirement plan fell victim to several bad turns. Her mother, rendered a shut-in by arthritis, didn’t have enough money for assisted-living facilities. Her daughter had to move back home after her own health setbacks.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I can make all of the plans in the world right now and it doesn’t mean anything,” says Barb.

Barb and Brian

Living in Benton County, the birthplace of Walmart Inc., Barb made a career out of helping manufacturers and suppliers service the retail giant.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Now she’s director of category management and business analytics for Cincinnati-based totes Isotoner Corp., which sells gloves, umbrellas and other products.

</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1995,</span> Barb was divorced with two children when a friend invited her to a birthday party at Alibis, a country-and-western dance bar in Rogers, Ark., where Brian was a bouncer. An annoying chicken farmer kept asking her to dance. Brian elbowed him aside, took her hand and led her onto the dance floor.

Six months later, the two eloped. Barb had confessed only days earlier that she <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41,</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 years</span> Brian’s senior. He didn’t mind.

The minister at the small timbered chapel pulled the vestment over the lures hanging from his fishing vest, rolled out a burgundy carpet, set up some fake flowers and declared them married. The next couple in line threw rice on the Strickerts as they headed off to a two-day honeymoon in Branson, Mo.

Barb sang for years at church, while Brian ran the sound equipment during services. Now they attend Saturday night services at Fellowship Bible Church in Rogers, as well as small Bible study sessions every other Tuesday.

The Strickerts are planners. Barb had long envisioned living in a log house in the woods. In the 1980s, she set aside a house design she spotted in Country Living magazine, and after marrying she posted the picture on the fridge. Brian, a heating and air-conditioning technician, re-created the house by hand on the lot by Beaver Lake. After an errant candle burned the house down <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> he built it again.

They began planning retirement when Barb <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55.</span> The plan evolved over the years, but the gist was that they’d turn <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 3,800</span>-square-foot home into a B&B, plant an organic garden, call it Whispering Pines Farm and Home, and attract the craft-fair and motorcycle-rally crowds.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Brian sold his HVAC business <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 14 weeks</span> in Nashville taking a sound-engineering course.</span> He returned home, bought used high-end microphones and converted the garage into a hobby studio. Early clients include a local resort owner who’s recording a Christmas album and a nephew with a death-metal band.

Marlene

A running Strickert family joke was that Brian and Barb had built a home far too big for a couple of empty-nesters. Barb’s children, Rebecca and Michael, and Brian’s daughter, Krystle, had all moved out.

Brian hadn’t yet finished the studio, however, when Barb’s mother, Marlene Creitz, moved in with them.

Marlene grew up the child of sharecroppers in Dover, Kan., and married Jim Creitz when she was still in high school. Jim had a cherry-red hot rod he had built from a ’32 Ford at <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 19.</span> Marlene used to push-start his first dragster.

They raised Barb, her brother and two sisters in Tulsa, where Marlene worked as an administrator in a doctor’s office.

Many parents of boomers reached retirement age in the mid-1990s, as companies were cutting back on pensions and leaving their retirees to fend for themselves with Social Security and 401(k) plans. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Marlene and Jim never built up a financial cushion.</span> They had a bit of savings and Social Security. Marlene used to pray: “God, please don’t let me get sick <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 65,</span> because we don’t have any money to pay the bill.”

In their retirement, the Creitzes lived in a Holiday Rambler RV, but couldn’t afford gas for road trips. Hoping to make them more comfortable, Barb bought her parents a single-wide mobile home they installed in a Tulsa trailer park. One night <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> Jim set the automatic coffee maker for his morning cup, went to bed and never woke up.

At first, Marlene tried living alone in Tulsa, but Barb and her sisters worried about her safety in a declining neighborhood. The Strickerts moved the trailer to a mobile-home park not far from their house.

Often Marlene just stayed in bed, depressed about Jim and their son Donnie, who had died in his 50s. Getting around was difficult. Marlene has suffered from arthritis since the 1960s and had both hips replaced, one of them twice.

One day she crashed her car into the front deck of her mobile home. A neighbor spotted her trying to crawl up to the back door. Barb and her sisters decided Marlene could no longer live alone.

A yearlong stay with Barb’s sister in Missouri didn’t work out. In <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2015,</span> Marlene moved into Barb’s basement, a suite that now has a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a sitting room.

Marlene’s knees hurt so much that she now can’t move around without a walker. Arthritis in her wrists and shoulders makes it hard for her to play gospel and ragtime on the keyboard in her sitting room. (“She’s kind of a Liberace honky-tonk,” says Brian.)

“I don’t go anywhere,” she says. “I get lonesome. I really do.”

She spends her days in fuzzy moccasins and a cushioned chair, watching Nascar races and the Weather Channel. Throughout the day, Marlene and Barb swap texts with updates on who’s leading the qualifying rounds and who’s getting heavy rain.

Marlene wanted to believe Barb’s house was a waypoint on her return to Tulsa. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">An assisted-living facility there would have <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $3,500 a</span> month.</span> Between her savings and <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">her $1,106 monthly</span> Social Security take-home, her money would have run out <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 3 1</span>/2 years, according to Marlene and Brian. That <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3 1</span>/2 years ago.

Marlene’s arrival was fraught for Barb. No meal was right, no conversation to Marlene’s satisfaction. Finally, Brian snapped Marlene out of her torpor. “These are the facts of life,” he chided her. “You have to straighten up or we’re going to put you in one of those homes you don’t want to be in.”

Marlene couldn’t escape the sense that she was a burden. For years, she insisted on doing Barb and Brian’s laundry. Lately she has been too fragile to take on chores. “You’re doing too much for me,” she would tell Barb.

Barb would counter with a verse memorized from the Book of Timothy: “Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”

“I know that if I want her to stop arguing, I should pull out the Good Book,” says Barb.

Marlene stopped arguing.

Rebecca

Four months after Marlene moved in, in <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2015,</span> Barb’s daughter, Rebecca Wilkins, moved into the other basement bedroom.

Rebecca had moved out years earlier, managing an apartment building for work while kayaking and rappelling for fun, with a snorting laugh that itself made her snort with laughter.

Then, at <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 25,</span> old medical conditions flared up. She had been born with spina bifida and other spinal problems. She started having seizures. Back surgery left her with so much scar tissue that she is now inoperable. She blew two discs in her back.

“Everything kind of collapsed,” Rebecca says. “I went from being a normal person...to completely not functional in life at all.”

She puts her hand to her hip when she gets out of a chair, levering herself to her feet like someone more than twice her age. She can’t kayak any more—it would leave her sobbing in bed with pain.

The physical issues coincide with psychological challenges. She has been diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorders. A couple of rough relationships left Rebecca with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and she remains persecuted by night terrors, she says.

Sometimes putting laundry in the machine constitutes a full day’s achievements.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Her only income <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $700 in</span> monthly disability payments, while Medicaid covers her drug bills and Medicare her doctor’s bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Strickerts pay for clothes, housing, food, car insurance and everything else that is beyond Rebecca’s meager income.

</span>Brian is building her a cottage across the circle drive from the main house. Rebecca hopes it will restore a bit of her independence; she worries she won’t be able to clean it herself.

She rarely forgets to tell her parents that she loves them. “If I didn’t have these two amazing people in my life,” Rebecca says, “I’d be homeless.”

Full House

Tending to a sick child would have been one thing. But after adding in an aging parent, the Strickerts had to rework their plan. Barb earned more money than Brian could as an HVAC technician, so she put off retirement indefinitely. Brian would stay home as the day-shift caregiver.

<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 7 each</span> morning, the Strickerts hammer out the day’s schedule on a color-coded shared scheduling app. Medical appointments, pharmacy runs, grocery shopping. Rebecca is orange, Brian is purple, Barb is blue.

Barb gets a month of paid vacation. She and Brian used to spend it hiking in Colorado or Wyoming, or taking in the sun in Florida. Now they spend vacations at home. One of Barb’s sisters takes in Marlene for a month each year, but that doesn’t cover Rebecca.

They’re hoping that one sister will move in for a week or two next year so they can take a road trip to Yosemite and the Pacific Northwest for Barb’s 65th.

“Of all my friends in this age group, I’m the only one who’s still working,” she says. “I have an idea of what I’d like to do, but I don’t feel at liberty to do it right now.”

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Barb has <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1,000</span>-a-month pension from an old job, and the couple has retirement accounts.</span> The money would be enough to retire on if there were just the two of them, they say. But they’re also saving for Rebecca’s long-term care and covering some of Marlene’s daily expenses.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“The only thing that worries me is that my health holds out long enough to generate the income I have to generate,” Barb says.</span> She’s looking into other ways to make money—renting out rooms perhaps, or consulting.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">More than a third of people in their 60s who are caring for parents reported a “moderate-to-high level of financial strain” as a result, a survey by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP found.

</span><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 18 months</span> ago Barb started to experience growing anxiety. Brian watched her essential tremors worsen, a gentle bobbing of her head.

Six months later, Barb found herself <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sleeping 14 hours</span> a night, sapped of energy and joy. In January, she started to feel tightness in her chest. The cardiologist diagnosed her with stable angina, brought on by a blocked artery and compounded by stress. Angina and cholesterol drugs helped ease her symptoms.

When things get especially tough, she calls in friends from church, a group she calls her “prayer warriors.” At one low point, Barb sought advice from a social worker from a nearby senior center. The social worker warned that she wouldn’t be of much use to her family if she wore herself out.

Barb followed her advice and hired someone to clean and shop. Marlene pays her share. During a mother-daughter visit to the hair salon last month, Barb asked Rebecca to take on light administrative duties—open Barb’s bills, make a few appointments. Rebecca was thrilled at the prospect of regaining a sense of purpose.

In her optimistic moments, Rebecca believes she’ll be independent again someday, perhaps even pain-free. In her darker ones, she fears things will never be the way they were.

“I feel for my parents,” she says. “I know this is not the relationship they wanted with their adult child.”

Marlene hopes for her own quick death, so she’ll no longer be a worry to her family.

“I’m of the age now where I’m looking forward to changing address, stepping over to the heavenly side,” she says, as images of wildfires and floods flicker across the Weather Channel screen.

Barb has let go of any bitterness she may have felt when her own dreams were shelved.

“You have to finally get to the attitude that whatever will be will be,” she says. “You don’t abandon family because something’s inconvenient.”

She and Brian no longer write down their plans.

90855,"<h3>Why Uber Might Stalk an IPO Sooner Rather Than Later</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">A big factor: the likelihood that revenue growth will soon slow significantly, if it hasn’t already

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 2</span>:11 pm ET

Uber Technologies Inc.’s recent sale of its China business <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1 billion</span> while acquiring <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20% of</span> rival Didi Chuxing Technology Co. has been widely hailed as a potential step toward an initial public offering.

</span>That is true. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick has said the company was <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">losing $1 billion</span> a year in China; eliminating those losses makes an IPO more likely.

But it also masks much of Uber’s motivation to go public in the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 18 months</span>. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Here’s another factor: the likelihood that Uber’s revenue growth will soon slow significantly, if it hasn’t already.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Since Uber’s shareholders aim to fetch the highest possible price for the company, it is better for Uber, which remains unprofitable, to go public before its growth slows too much.</span> If Uber times it right, it can make investors in public markets believe it is a good buy—even at a valuation greater than its most <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">recent $68 billion</span>.

“The challenge from an IPO perspective is, Uber is going out at something <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $65 billion</span>, so it’s hard to pitch that as a growth story,” says Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights.

This isn’t just about the law of large numbers. There are reasons to think Uber’s growth has slowed or will soon slow.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">First, Uber may be close to saturating the U.S. market for its primary ride-sharing service.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Market researcher eMarketer predicted in May that the rate of growth in the number of Americans who use a ride-sharing service will shrink <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 7.2% in</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> from a <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">projected 13.3% in</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017.</span>

</span>Of course, existing riders may use the service more often. But that alone might not be enough to justify Uber’s current valuation.

Uber touts a recent Pew finding <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 15% of</span> Americans have used either Uber or rival Lyft Inc., suggesting both companies have much room to grow. But the same study found that Uber’s core ridership is a narrow slice of the U.S.: young, urban and wealthy, with access to mass transit, taxis, car-sharing services like Zipcar and amenities within walking or biking distance.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The upshot: Uber’s explosive growth to date is effectively the low-hanging fruit of the ride-sharing market, in both revenue and profit.</span> To continue growing at its current pace, Uber will need to penetrate suburbs and second-tier cities. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Residents there are sparser and have fewer complementary transportation options, meaning they won’t yield as much revenue or as many per-capita rides as bigger, denser cities.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Arun Sundararajan, a professor at NYU Leonard N. Stern School of Business who has studied ride sharing, estimates that roughly half of Americans live in areas that aren’t dense enough to support ride sharing.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">At the same time, Uber will face increasing pressure from competitors and its own drivers to shrink its margins in the U.S. “Ride sharing is a commodity business in the long run, so there’s plenty of room for multiple players,” Mr. Sundararajan says.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Conventional wisdom holds that ride sharing is a winner-take-all market.</span> But Uber’s many domestic competitors, and the ease with which it has been copied overseas, suggest the barriers to entry are less about technology and more about access to capital.

A second avenue for Uber to grow is outside the U.S., where the company already is in more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400 cities</span> and <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 72 countries</span>. China is now closed off, but a person familiar with Uber’s plans says that the company is redirecting resources, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 150 engineers</span> who worked exclusively on China, to other markets, including Latin America and Southeast Asia.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The person also said China had accounted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 40% of</span> Uber’s trips, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">but 15% of</span> its revenue.</span> That illustrates a big issue Uber, and others like Facebook Inc., face overseas: Markets outside the developed world are far less lucrative.

In the first six months of this year, Uber said it completed a billion rides, doubling its lifetime total to two billion since <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2009.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">To the extent that growth is mostly outside the U.S., it adds little to revenue and, by the company’s own account, subtracts from profit.

</span>Uber has also talked about arranging for delivery of goods, as well as people. But here, too, Uber doesn’t appear to have any special advantage, and faces big, sophisticated competitors, including Amazon.com Inc.

Then, there is technology. But the company’s much-touted aspirations to replace drivers with self-driving cars will likely bear fruit only for investors willing to wait decades.

Mr. Kalanick has said that Uber will plan an IPO “as late as possible,” but has declined to specify when that might be. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The company is sitting on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $13 billion</span> in cash and available credit and debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s plans.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That means Uber doesn’t need to go public to fund its current business.

</span>But investors, some of whom are board members, helped propel the sale of Uber China to Didi Chuxing. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Those investors understand the logic of taking Uber public before its revenue growth stalls.

</span>It is also important to remember that an IPO is the beginning of a journey, not the end. Consider Facebook, which went public <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 at</span> a then-record valuation <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $104 billion</span>. The early days were ugly; in three months, the shares lost roughly half their value. Today, though, Facebook is valued at more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $350 billion</span>. Uber investors wouldn’t complain about such an outcome.

The Federal Reserve chair says inflation will likely remain high in coming months.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, is set to tell House lawmakers that inflation has increased “notably” and is poised to remain higher in coming months before moderating — but he will make no indication that the recent jump in prices is pushing central bankers to rush to change policy.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed chair will attribute high inflation numbers to factors tied to the economy’s reopening from the pandemic, based on the text of his prepared remarks.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He will offer no precise estimate for when or how much price pressures will ease.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, starting at noon, will come at a fraught moment politically and economically when it comes to inflation.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Consumer Price Index spiked <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.4 percent</span> in June, the biggest jump <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008 and</span> a larger move than economists had expected.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Price pressures appear to be poised to last longer than policymakers at the White House or Fed had expected.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating,” Mr. Powell is prepared to say.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">He will explain that today’s higher inflation comes from temporary data quirks, rising prices on goods and services facing supply constraints that ought to “partially reverse,” and prices for services that were hard-hit by the pandemic and are now experiencing a demand surge.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He will also note that longer-run inflation expectations remain under control — which matters because inflation outlooks help to shape the future path for prices.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Expectations “have moved up from their pandemic lows and are in a range that is broadly consistent with the F.O.M.C.’s longer-run inflation goal,” Mr. Powell said, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed chair’s prepared remarks make no indication that the path for policy will change based on the hotter-than-expected price data.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Instead, he will say that labor market conditions are improving but that “there is still a long way to go” and that the Fed’s goal of achieving “substantial further progress” toward its economic goals before taking the first steps toward a more normal policy setting “is still a ways off.”
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fed officials are debating when and how to slow <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their $120 billion</span> of monthly government-backed bond purchases, which would be the first step in moving policy away from an emergency mode.</span> Mr. Powell said those discussions will continue “in coming meetings.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The central bank is also maintaining its policy interest rate at near-zero, which helps to keep borrowing cheap for consumers and businesses.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Officials have set out a higher standard for lifting rates: They want the economy to return to full employment and inflation to come in on track to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 2 percent</span> over time.
</span>Raising rates is not yet up for discussion, officials have said publicly and privately.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said the Fed’s current approach means that “monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.”

The median home value in the San Jose region — which includes the headquarters of Facebook, Apple and Google — has <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached $922,100,</span> five times that of the nation overall <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.5 times</span> the Washington area’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $356,000 median</span>, according to real estate website Zillow.com.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">That’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">also 20 percent</span> higher than nearby San Francisco, the nation’s No.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 market</span> and the usual target of eye-rolling about a tech-fueled, out-of-control housing market.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">But the market is even crazier in the sedate suburbs to the south, in places such as Los Gatos.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The situation in Silicon Valley has long been a full-blown affordability crisis for teachers and construction workers, anyone who draws a paycheck without stock options.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even doctors and lawyers find themselves priced out of popular areas, according to real estate agents.</span> Now, it is becoming harder for tech workers who are willing to spend well <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1 million</span> for what was once a standard-issue suburban home.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">As prices spiral ever higher, there is growing concern about Silicon Valley’s ability to attract and keep its tech talent, especially as the millennial workers who flocked here during the current boom grow up, shed roommates, start families and look for homes of their own.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It’s an increasingly challenging phenomenon,” said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which has found that the region’s company executives cite housing as their biggest impediment to recruitment.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">For people moving to Silicon Valley, home prices often lead to disillusionment, said Eric Boyenga, a real estate agent specializing in the area.</span> Many still feel compelled to move. But not everyone gives in.
Boyenga recalled spending weeks showing homes to a client from North Carolina who had just sold his company to eBay, based in San Jose, and planned to move to Silicon Valley. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">His budget <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $6 million</span>.</span> But he decided after weeks of looking that it was cheaper to stay on the East Coast and fly out a couple of times each month.
“What you get <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $4 million</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5 million</span> here is what you can get <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $350,000 in</span> North Carolina,” Boyenga said.
Barry and Katie Templin moved to Silicon Valley right out of college, more than a decade ago. They rented, then bought a small condo in San Jose, then went back to renting. They got married. They had a son. Wyatt is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 3.</span> Their daughter, Hazel, arrived four months ago. Now, the Templins want a place to put down roots.
They both grew up in the Midwest — he’s from Indiana, she’s from Wisconsin — and their parents back home delight in hearing about the house hunt. To them, it sounds like a tragicomedy. The Templins are up against buyers paying all in cash and willing to waive contingencies. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">And $1 million</span> is the absolute bottom floor. (Anything lower leads to an open-house stampede and a bidding war.)
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“My parents are just horrified by the housing prices,” Barry Templin,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 37,</span> said, laughing.
</span>Katie Templin,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 36,</span> said her father enjoys pointing out that she could buy an entire office building in her hometown of La Crosse, Wis. To make his point, he sent her a listing for a brick, three-story, former bank branch.
“He thinks it’s just absurd,” Katie Templin said.
“But out here, it doesn’t shock people,” Barry Templin said.
They love Silicon Valley. The sun is always shining. The winters are mild. Beaches and mountains are a one-hour drive away. They both work at start-ups. He is vice president of engineering at CardioKinetix, a medical device company working on an implant for heart failure. She is a program manager at AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.
“You can’t beat the opportunities available at tech companies,” she said.
Before crossing the haunted house off their list, the couple visited a property billed as a “Lovely Silicon Valley Farmhouse.” It was farmhouse red, but there was no farm. It sat off a quiet residential street. The kitchen was dated. The den had peculiar wood paneling on the floor and ceiling. But it had three beds <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1,500 square</span> feet of living space <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.25 million</span>.
In Silicon Valley, that’s a deal.
They put it on their list of maybes.
DeFilippo, their agent, used to work as a lawyer. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But two years ago — when she moved from Atlanta to Silicon Valley, in part to be closer to her sister, an Apple executive — she became fascinated by the local real estate market.</span> So she switched careers. Now, she is making more than she ever did as a lawyer.
But that still hasn’t allowed her to afford her own home. As she took the Templins to tour another home, DeFilippo drove by the tiny two-bedroom house she rents <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,600 a</span> month.
“I’d like to buy, but it’s not in the foreseeable future,” she said.
The Templins’ infant daughter was getting fussy. The day’s last house would be a California Mission-style home <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.4 million</span>. But the front door was locked. The lockbox was empty. The listing agent didn’t answer DeFilippo’s calls. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The seller holds all the power in a hot market like this one.</span> Katie Templin peered into the windows. She wasn’t thrilled by the location.
They decided to keep hunting. DeFilippo was certain that the Templins would eventually find a home to buy.
“They’ll get in here,” she said. “I know they will.”
Weeks later, after several more house-hunting sorties and failing to win a fierce bidding war for <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.3 million</span> fixer-upper, they did. It was <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $1.3 million</span> home. It was in good shape, with four bedrooms and two bathrooms, and <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered 1,600 square</span> feet. But it was located in south San Jose, just outside their ideal location.
The house is a mid-century modern tract home, what is known as an Eichler, named after noted developer Joseph Eichler, who <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">built 11,000 clean</span>-lined, simple homes in California after World War II. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Steve Jobs credited growing up in an Eichler house in Mountain View with influencing his design aesthetic at Apple, although there is some controversy about whether the childhood home of Silicon Valley’s patron saint really was one.
</span>In any case, the Templins now have an Eichler of their own. They move in January. They will happily leave the house hunt to someone else."
88571,"<h3>2020 Democrats Address Poverty and Systemic Racism at Presidential Forum</h3>WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Monday defended his approach to working with Republicans, suggesting that those who cannot conceive of compromising with the opposition might as well “start a real, physical revolution.”
“Folks, look, if you start off with the notion there’s nothing you can do, well, might you all go home then, man?” he said. “Or let’s start a real, physical revolution if you’re talking about it. Because we have to be able to change what we’re doing within our system.”
Mr. Biden, who has drawn criticism from some liberals for his efforts to appeal to moderates in a polarized era, also expressed confidence about how he would fare in the South if he wins the Democratic nomination and faces President Trump in the general election. He said that he planned on winning North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and that he believed he could win Florida and Texas as well.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden made his comments at a presidential forum convened by the Poor People’s Campaign, which seeks to draw attention to issues like poverty and systemic racism.</span> It is a revival of the campaign that was planned by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination a half-century ago.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]
Mr. Biden, who leads in early polling of the Democratic presidential race, was one of nine candidates for the nomination who spoke at the forum, held at Trinity Washington University in the nation’s capital. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">He described poverty as “the one thing that can bring this country down.”
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also talked about a revolution, but in a different way: He repeated his call for a “political revolution.”
</span>“Today and in the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 45 years</span>, we heard a whole lot of talk and a whole lot of speeches and a whole lot of party platforms,” Mr. Sanders said. “But you know what goes on? <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Today, the average worker in America is making exactly the same wages that he or she <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">made 45 years</span> ago.”
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The candidates touched on a variety of subjects affecting lower-income people.</span> Mr. Sanders reiterated his call for voting rights for incarcerated people. Senator Kamala Harris of California, a former prosecutor, spoke of changing the cash bail system and providing relief to renters. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts outlined her plan to create a wealth tax and use the proceeds to pay for programs like universal child care.
</span>On the matter of how to deal with likely Republican opposition in the Senate, Ms. Warren struck a notably different tone than Mr. Biden. She repeated her call to get rid of the Senate filibuster if necessary, so that a narrow Democratic majority in that chamber could push through legislation over Republican objections.
“We have to be willing to get in this fight,” Ms. Warren said.
The Poor People’s Campaign is led by the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a civil rights leader from North Carolina, and the Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis, the director of Kairos: The Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary in New York.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The issue of poverty is at the heart of the campaign.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 million</span> people in the United States were in poverty, or <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> of the population, according to the Census Bureau.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">To show the scope of the issue, however, the campaign says that by another measure, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 140 million</span> people can be considered either poor or low-income.
</span>[We’d like to know: What do you want the candidates to talk about at the debates?]
“The word ‘poor’ has basically become a four-letter word for the past half a century,” Dr. Theoharis said in an interview. “If some politicians talk about it, it’s to punish and demonize people who are poor. And many, including many Democrats, refuse to even talk about the poor.”
The candidate forum was an effort to put a spotlight on the subject. “There has to be a narrative shift,” Dr. Barber said in an interview. “If we keep having an anemic, small, limited political debate and discussion, we’re going to keep getting what we’ve always gotten.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before the forum on Monday, the Poor People’s Campaign and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank, released the Poor People’s Moral Budget, a lengthy collection of policy proposals intended to help bring about a “moral economy.”</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The proposals included reducing military spending by nearly half and increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy people, including creating a wealth tax that mirrors what Ms. Warren has proposed.
</span>Organizers of the forum said Mr. Trump was invited to appear but did not respond. The Trump campaign declined to comment."

When many campuses reopened in the fall, outbreaks raced through dorms, infected hundreds of thousands of students and employees, and spread to the wider community.</span> After students returned for the spring term this year, increased testing, social distancing rules and an improving national outlook helped curb the virus on many campuses. Gradually, college-age people became eligible for the vaccine and, by late April, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">everyone 16 or</span> older could get a shot in every state.
In the spring term, counties with large populations of college students have seen total case numbers drop, in line with the national trend.

The first, she said, was anticipated when students returned from winter break after traveling across the country and world. She said the university was able to contain those cases quickly through testing, contact tracing and isolation.
The second spike occurred, she said, after power outages riddled Texas during a storm in February. Students on and off campus went days without power or running water, so some of those who still had electricity invited others to take showers and eat hot meals.
“We encouraged them to help each other — but also reminded them of the best ways to do so as safely as possible,” Ms. Coody-Anders said, adding that it was unfortunate that the outages happened when the positivity rate in the region was high, creating a perfect storm.
She added, “They really did their best — great show of community — but the virus was really rampant at that point, and they were cold.”

The location of a university’s main campus is listed unless otherwise specified. In several instances, colleges noted that some cases were tied to branch campuses or satellite locations.
Thanks to the arrival of the Covid vaccines, many colleges are moving forward with plans for a more normal fall term.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Schools have also hosted vaccine clinics and pushed students and employees to get their shots.</span> The Times has identified more <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 schools</span> — including the University of Pennsylvania, the University of San Diego and the University of Maryland — that have said they will require students to be vaccinated in order to attend in-person classes in the fall. Dozens more, including large public university systems in California and New York, announced that they would require shots if the F.D.A. gave full approval for a vaccine.
Many more colleges have said that only certain students, such as athletes or students who live on campus, must get a shot. Most have said they will allow medical, religious and other exemptions. Some colleges, including the University of Maine and Illinois Wesleyan University, have said they will not require shots while the vaccines have only emergency authorization.
The University of Michigan-Dearborn, which has <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 9,000 students</span>, has decided not to require vaccination. Instead, unvaccinated students will have to submit a negative coronavirus test each week before coming to campus, according to Ken Kettenbeil, a vice chancellor.
Mr. Kettenbeil said the college does not have students living in dorms, and they commute in for classes. But the details of the new requirements are still being worked out.
“One thing we’re still figuring out is how do we record this?” he said. “How do we track it? We’re still working on how we’re going to have people submit proof of vaccination and the negative tests.”
About the data
The college case data is as recent as <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 26,</span><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span> It is based on reports from colleges and government sources and may lag. Cases include those of students, faculty members, staff members and other college workers.
Colleges and government agencies report this data differently, so exercise caution when comparing institutions. Some colleges declined to provide data, provided partial data or did not respond to inquiries. At some institutions, cases may be spread across multiple campuses.
Case totals include confirmed positive cases and probable cases, where available. Colleges occasionally adjust their data downward if new information emerges. Some colleges subtract cases from their tallies once people recover. Some report only those tests performed on campus. Some did not <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">separate 2020 case</span> data <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2021 case</span> data. And some initially provided some data but then stopped. The calculation of percent change from the end <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020 to</span> the present is, in some cases, skewed by the incomplete data colleges have provided.
With no national tracking system, and statewide data available only sporadically, colleges have made their own rules for how to tally infections. While The Times’s survey is believed to be the most comprehensive account available, it is also an undercount. Many universities, hoping to quickly identify cases and prevent broader outbreaks, have aggressively tested for the virus, detecting cases in some instances that might otherwise have been missed.
Among the colleges contacted by The Times, most have published case information online or responded to requests for case numbers. The Times has obtained case data through open records requests at several public universities that would not otherwise provide numbers. Most colleges do not publicly report coronavirus-related deaths.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Times counted reported cases among university students and employees in all fields, including those whose roles as doctors, nurses, pharmacists or medical students put them at higher risk of contracting the virus.</span> Some universities have a broad range of programs, including medical units, and reported dozens of cases tied to health care. Those cases are listed below as a subset of their universitywide totals.
Infections linked to medical schools and teaching hospitals
Some universities did not provide data for cases at their medical schools, hospitals or clinics. Some included those cases in their campuswide counts but did not specify how many there were. Other universities that are primarily focused on medical training, or that reported small numbers of cases tied to clinical programs, are listed in the main table on this page with an asterisk."
2073,"<h3>Trump’s company could save millions if interest rates fall as he demands</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">President Trump stands to save millions of dollars annually in interest on outstanding loans on his hotels and resorts if the Federal Reserve lowers rates as he has been demanding, according to public filings and financial experts.
</span>In the five years before he became president, Trump borrowed more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $360 million</span> via four loans from Deutsche Bank for his hotels in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, as well his 643-room Doral golf resort in South Florida.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The payments on all four properties vary with interest rate changes, according to Trump’s official financial disclosures.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That means he has already benefited from falling interest rates that were spurred in part by a cut the Federal Reserve announced in July, the first in more than a decade — and his payments could drop by millions of dollars more annually if the central bank grants Trump’s wish and further lowers short-term rates, experts said.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It will reduce his borrowing costs quite a bit if he gets what he wants,” said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.</span> Braun said Trump’s savings could be even greater if Deutsche Bank permits his company to pay down the loans more quickly without a penalty, which banks sometimes allow.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">While Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are managing the family business, the president insisted on retaining ownership of his company after his election, bucking the practice of past presidents.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That decision, ethics experts warned, would lead to potential conflicts of interest between his personal interests and public policy goals.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Trump administration has argued that lower interest rates would spur more consumers to buy homes and cars and businesses to invest in new factories.</span> Cutting rates also typically lowers the value of the dollar, making U.S. products cheaper to overseas buyers, a goal of the president.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But most economists and business leaders say Trump’s trade war is the biggest threat to the economy, not interest rates, which are already at historically low levels.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since taking office, Trump has aggressively sought to lower interest rates and rejected the mostly hands-off approach other presidents have taken to the Fed, repeatedly blasting Chair Jerome H. Powell — whom Trump appointed to the post last year — for not falling in line.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">On Friday, after Powell made no announcement of a rate cut and instead voiced concerns about Trump’s trade war with China, the president immediately attacked him on Twitter, writing that “As usual the Fed did NOTHING!”</span> and comparing Powell to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Trump posted.
Trump and his advisers have privately discussed creating a rotation among the Federal Reserve governors that would reduce Powell’s influence, The Washington Post reported this past week.
Asked Friday night by reporters if he wanted Powell to resign, the president responded, “If he did, I wouldn’t stop him.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">[Trump calls the Fed chair an ‘enemy’ after Powell said trade war is ‘turbulent’]
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The central bank’s benchmark rate is one factor in determining interest owed on variable-rate loans, the kind the president has on his properties.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates have also been driven down because of the trade war with China and anxieties about global growth.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Experts said it’s difficult to ascertain exactly how much Trump would save if he gets the reduction in short-term interest rates that he has urged, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2.25 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.25 percent</span> — a move typically reserved for economic emergencies.
</span>But the president would be substantially impacted by a rate cut, they agreed.
Beginning <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span></span> Deutsche Bank provide Trump’s company with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $364 million</span> in loans by working through the bank’s private wealth division, rather than through traditional commercial lending units, according to public loan documents.
The borrowing was for two loans <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $125 million</span> to buy and renovate the Doral golf resort in Florida, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $170 million</span> loan to renovate Washington’s Old Post Office Pavilion into a Trump hotel and <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $69 million</span> loan to refinance an existing Trump hotel in Chicago.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Trump’s financial disclosures and loan records indicate that all four of the loans remain outstanding.</span> His company has paid down at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $19 million</span> of the Chicago loan, according to the filings, though the documents do not show the amount of the remaining balances for any of the properties.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Trump could save at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $600,000 and</span> as much <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1.1 million</span> annually on just the larger of the two Doral loans if the Fed made a percentage point reduction, depending on the loan agreement, according to Clifford Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland’s business school.
</span>Even a quarter-point reduction, which most Wall Street investors now predict will occur in mid-September, could save Trump as much <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $275,000 annually</span> on that single Doral loan.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">“If you’re a consumer borrower with a car loan or a credit card, a quarter-point reduction is significant savings,” Rossi said.</span> Trump “has more loans and a bigger dollar size, so he would get certainly a larger reduction on the amount owed than most Americans out there.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">An analysis by Bloomberg News found that for every quarter-point reduction, Trump could <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">save $850,000 in</span> annual interest rate payments, which would mean more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3 million</span> in annual savings if the Fed dropped rates a full percentage point as Trump has demanded.
</span>During his years as a real estate developer, Trump was famous for his aggressive efforts to save money, even when it meant breaking up relationships or shattering professional norms.
Trump has been sued dozens of times for nonpayment of bills, by building contractors, bartenders and even his own lawyers. He used money from a nonprofit charity to pay off legal settlements for his for-profit businesses. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">He once sued his own lender, Deutsche Bank, to get out of a large mortgage.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Before entering politics, Trump often advocated for lower interest rates, which are key for a business that relies on large sums of debt.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Interest rates are very critical to the real estate industry, and [Trump has] spent his whole career there, so he has strong opinions about where interest rates should be,” said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</span> “Every real estate person I’ve ever met in my life has always wanted lower rates in all circumstances, so I think that’s part of [Trump’s] nature.”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">In the 1980s, Trump became one of the most aggressive borrowers in the country, using cheap loans to finance an Atlantic City casino empire that ultimately failed and forced four of his companies to file for bankruptcy.
</span>In the wake of that collapse, Trump was largely frozen out by big banks. He used cash to fund much of his company’s more recent real estate expansion, then turned to an increasingly risk-taking Deutsche Bank for some big loans starting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span></span> as The Post has previously reported.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">[As the ‘King of Debt,’ Trump borrowed to build his empire.</span> Then he began spending hundreds of millions in cash.]
Democrats in Congress have subpoenaed his Deutsche bank records, but Trump sued to stop the bank from responding and the matter remains mired in court.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Previous presidents have avoided publicly criticizing the Fed to maintain the board’s insulation from politics.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Trump decided otherwise from the get-go and as global economic concerns mounted in recent weeks, he escalated his already routine attacks on Powell, tweeting at different times in July that “the Federal Reserve doesn’t have a clue!”</span> and “They raised rates too soon, too often, & tightened, while others did just the opposite.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Four former Fed chairs, collectively appointed and reappointed by six presidents, then published a Wall Street Journal op-ed urging that the Fed be allowed to act “free of short-term political pressures and, in particular, without the threat of removal or demotion of Fed leaders for political reasons.”
</span>Trump further amped up the pressure Friday after Powell spoke at a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair said the U.S. economy was in a “favorable place” but that the trade war Trump launched against China had created a “complex, turbulent” situation.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Trump responded with a tirade on Twitter, blaming China for a boatload of issues and demanding that U.S. companies avoid doing business there.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Stock market investors, already wary of a shaky bond market and declining consumer confidence, began a sell-off that resulted in steep market losses.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Braun, the Northwestern professor, said Trump’s constant pressure on the Fed chair and his colleagues to adjust rates to suit the president’s liking could hurt the U.S. economy.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“I don’t think the Fed should be accommodating Trump’s trade war, and the risk is potential inflation and the reputation of the Fed in the future,” he said.</span>"

</span>8:04 p.m.: A football coach is reportedly one staff member who put himself in between the killer and students. The Miami Herald reports that early accounts mistakenly said Feis had died but a colleague tweeted that he is only wounded.
This, ladies and gentlemen, if the face of a hero. Coach Aaron Feis was injured protecting a student in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and, at last report, is in critical condition. He is a friend to all students that know him. He was always so nice to me when I went to school there, and I know he is close with my brother and his friends. Please, take a moment to send healing prayers for him.

A classmate says the suspect showed him photos of his guns:
He’s been a troubled kid and has always had a certain amount of issues going on. He shot guns because he felt it gave him I guess — what’s the word I’m looking for — an exhilarating feeling… He showed me [his guns] personally through his phone and stuff like that I stayed clear of him most of the time during my time in alternate school I didn’t wanna be with him at all because I didn’t wanna cause any conflict with him because that’s the impression he gave off.
5:05 p.m.:
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel says the suspected shooter is was arrested without incident. They are still not sure if all the kids are out.
The Miami Herald reports on the identity of the suspected shooter:
The former student suspected of opening fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland may been identified a potential threat to fellow students in the past, according to one teacher.
The 19-year-old ex-student, who has been detained by Broward police, has not been publicly identified as a suspect. But a law-enforcement source identified him as Nicolas Cruz.
…
“We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,” said math teacher Jim Gard, who said Cruz had been in his class last year. “There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.”

80389,"<h3>Could the tariffs ruin the holidays for shoppers?</h3>“Get out the Ouija board.<span id=""0"" class=""red"">""
That’s how one retail analyst summed up the tricky task of predicting what lies ahead for retailers and shoppers this holiday season.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Analysts say there’s ample reason to expect record-breaking sales on the back of a strong economy, a historically low unemployment rate and upward-ticking wages.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">But that’s all hedged by a hefty unknown: the threat of ongoing tariffs and an escalating trade war.</span> President Trump’s latest round of tariffs have kicked in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 percent</span> and are set to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 25 percent</span> at the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 6,000 products</span> -- including electronics and other go-to gifts -- will see price increases that, in time, are expected to pass from retailers to consumers.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">And while it’s unlikely that the brunt of those price hikes will take a toll over the next few months, experts agree that the sheer concern over how long the tariffs will last, and to what degree, could act as a Grinch to holiday shoppers.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Business doesn’t manage uncertainty well, nor does the consumer, and there is no way prices don’t get passed through the consumer,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.</span> “The problem I have is, who knows on a day-to-day basis where this is headed?”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The retail industry is still optimistic.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the National Retail Federation announced it is expecting retail sales in November and December to increase <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4.3 and</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.8 percent</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 2017 results</span>, to as much <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $720.89 billion</span>.</span> That forecast compares with an average annual increase <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.9 percent</span> over the past five years. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">(If Labor Day is any indicator, Americans spent a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $2 billion</span> online then alone.)
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But for comparison, holiday sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 rose</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.3 percent</span> over the year before, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $687.87 billion</span>, according to the NRF.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In mid-September, Deloitte anticipated retail holiday sales to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increase 5 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.6 percent</span> over last year’s shopping season -- totaling at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $1.1 trillion</span> between November and January.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rod Sides, leader of Deloitte’s U.S. retail and distribution practice, said shoppers are unlikely to make their shopping decisions based on geopolitical issues, such as global trade.
</span>“A lot of it comes down to when they look in their checkbook or their pocket,” Sides said. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“If they have a few extra dollars, whether it be the stock markets to the election to tariffs, it typically doesn’t trickle down.”
</span>[‘This could be catastrophic’: Small businesses say new tariffs will make it even harder to compete]
At the same time, retailers and industry groups have made their opposition to the tariffs clear. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Last month, Walmart sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer cautioning that additional tariffs <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span> of Chinese goods would strike a blow.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Walmart -- the largest retailer in the country -- wrote that the “immediate impact will be to raise prices on consumers and tax American businesses and manufacturers.""</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Target chief executive Brian Cornell said the company was “concerned about anything that would cause higher prices on everyday products for American families.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">That’s in concert with arguments from industry groups that say the tariffs will trigger price increases, even if not by this Thanksgiving or Christmas.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Retail Industry Leaders Association, an industry lobbying group, wrote to Lighthizer in September requesting the removal of more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 650 tariff</span> lines from the proposed list of products subject to the latest wave of tariffs.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Any tariffs on consumer goods proposed by Trump’s administration, the group wrote, are “nothing more than a hidden tax.”
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Larger retailers have long since secured low-priced inventory to get them through the holidays and into the new year.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">But Hun Quach, vice president for international trade at RILA, noted that as the Chinese tariffs drag on, businesses large and small will be forced to restructure their supply chains.</span> Changing the source on products as simple as plastic stickers can take as long as a year, she said.
“The pricing impact won’t hit immediately,"" she said. “I think a lot of this uncertainty is about how long these tariffs are going to be in place.”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">There’s also the question of whether retailers, embracing a strong economy and shoppers with money to spend, could increase prices anyway.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">But Cohen said that, even with signs pointing toward a strong holiday season, “the prospect of raising prices across the board is extremely problematic.</span> There’s no getting away with that.”
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Still, retailers will have to grapple with questions of when to time price increases on goods that will feel the full brunt of the tariffs at the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“Do you start to adjust prices now or do you wait until January?”</span> Cohen said. “That’s a difficult decision.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Mark Rosenbaum, department chair and professor of retailing at the University of South Carolina, said that many retailers placed their holiday-season orders over the summer, and that it would be unusual for them to alter the prices now because of the tariffs.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, noted that many of the tariffs apply to goods that have “already been ordered, and have been shipped and are on their way.”</span> The “precise effects of the tariffs are not yet completely clear,"" but any impacts are likely to hit closer to the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The tariffs may hit prices for jewelry by Valentine’s Day, for example, but that may be the earliest shoppers will feel a difference.
</span>In the meantime, retailers and shoppers will have reason to stay merry.
“Thinking about the ability to spend -- the data shows that we are in a good place,” Kleinhenz said. “The picture looks very good.”

33895,"<h3>China’s Economy Grew 3.9% in the Third Quarter</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">HONG KONG—China’s economy expanded more strongly than expected in the third quarter as the country bounced back modestly from crippling Covid lockdowns in the spring, though challenges remain as leader Xi Jinping consolidates control over the political apparatus for another five years.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">China’s gross domestic product grew <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.9% in</span> the three months ended Sept.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 from</span> a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Monday in a data release that was unexpectedly delayed as Communist Party leaders gathered for a key meeting in Beijing.
</span>The statistics bureau was originally slated to release the closely watched figures on Oct.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18,</span> but they were abruptly postponed a day earlier, citing unspecified “work arrangements” in remarks to The Wall Street Journal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The delay was never explained, though economists widely suspected officials of trying to avoid overshadowing the twice-a-decade conclave.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The economy’s third-quarter performance was an improvement from <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 0.4% year</span>-over-year GDP increase recorded in the second quarter, when lockdowns in major cities like Shanghai shuttered businesses and kept millions stuck at home, sometimes for weeks and even months on end.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the third-quarter number fell short of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.8% growth</span> rate recorded in the first three months of the year, before widespread Covid lockdowns hit the economy.</span> Monday’s figure also put overall growth for the first nine months <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022 at</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.0%,</span> well below the official full-year target of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.5% set</span> in March.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Other economic data, also released belatedly on Monday, underscored the challenges facing the economy.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Export growth continued to slow, a downturn in the housing market got worse and consumer spending decelerated again after a brief summer recovery.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Xi, speaking to the media on Sunday after securing a precedent-breaking third term in power, described China’s economy as highly resilient, with plenty of room to maneuver.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists say the headwinds facing the world’s second-largest economy are intensifying, which will bear down on growth this year and next.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">A property-sector slowdown has hurt construction, crushed consumer confidence and added to financial pressure on overstretched local governments.
</span>Chinese households have also cut back on spending amid the real estate slump and the threat of further restrictions on daily life to smother even tiny Covid-19 outbreaks. Officials have signaled they are unlikely to abandon their zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic anytime soon. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Many economists doubt any significant easing of the growth-sapping policy will occur before the middle of next year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">At the same time, China faces external challenges, with geopolitical tensions rising and overseas demand for its exports fading as the U.S., Europe and other economies confront rocketing inflation and rising interest rates.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for China this year and next, saying it expects the economy to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expand 3.2% in</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span> down from a forecast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.3% in</span> July, and <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 4.4% in</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2023,</span> down <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 4.6%.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Over a longer term, economists say that China is unlikely to recover the rapid pace of growth that it enjoyed over the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 20 years</span>, and it may never surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest economy—as many had predicted it would.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">They cite factors including an aging and shrinking population, a worsening standoff over trade, technology and foreign policy with the U.S. and an enormous pile of public and private debt.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">At the Communist Party congress, top officials said they were prepared to accept slower rates of economic growth to meet broader development goals, such as nurturing high-tech industries and redistributing wealth more evenly—two top priorities that have been frequently articulated by Mr. Xi.
Other data released Monday showed a lopsided domestic recovery, with much of the growth being generated by government-backed production and investments as consumer demand showed little signs of improvement.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Industrial production grew <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6.3% in</span> September from a year earlier, accelerating from <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2% increase</span> in August, as policy stimulus measures kicked in and a power shortage caused by extreme weather during the summer eased.
</span>Growth in fixed-asset investment, including for infrastructure projects, remained steady, expanding <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.9% during</span> the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier, slightly faster <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5.8% gains</span> in the first eight months <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022.</span>
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">China’s property slump, which was triggered in part by Mr. Xi’s attempts to tamp down on speculation in the sector, showed little sign of reversing in September, as property investment, new construction starts and home prices fell more.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The prolonged slide in Chinese new-home prices accelerated last month.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Prices fell at their steepest level in more than seven years in September, even after officials rolled out more policies to boost the embattled sector and support home buyer demand.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Average new-home prices <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 70 major</span> cities in September <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.3% from</span> a year earlier, after <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">falling 2.1% in</span> August, according to Wall Street Journal calculations based on data released Monday by China’s statistics bureau.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">What is likely to cause more worrying among officials who seek to tilt China’s economy toward consumption, spending appeared to have faltered again as stress on the labor market persisted.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Retail sales, a gauge of consumer spending, rose by a weaker-than-<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 2.5% from</span> a year earlier in September, down from <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5.4% increase</span> in August.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">China’s headline measure of joblessness, the urban surveyed unemployment rate, edged up <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5.5% in</span> September <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.3% for</span> the previous month, the statistics bureau said.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Joblessness among people aged <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 16 to</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24 remained</span> elevated <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 17.9%.</span>
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Separately, data released on Monday by the country’s customs authority provided fresh evidence that the export boom that propelled China’s sharp economic rebound in the early days of the pandemic is likely on its last legs.
</span>Shipments out of China <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 5.7% from</span> a year earlier in September, down from <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7.1% increase</span> in August, China’s General Administration of Customs said Monday, after also having delayed its data release by more than a week.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">China’s imports increased by an <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">anemic 0.3% in</span> September from a year earlier, on par with August’s figure, partly because of the real-estate downturn, which dampened China’s appetite for raw materials.

32600,"<h3>Why Fiat Chrysler’s Talks With Renault Fell Apart</h3>The proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Renault, a tie-up seen as a transformative deal in an industry facing technological challenges, fell apart on Wednesday, and the recriminations started almost immediately.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The stock prices of both companies — which jumped after Fiat announced its plan last week — are feeling the effects.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In early trading on Thursday, Renault shares were down more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 7 percent</span>; Fiat opened <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 4 percent</span> lower, but then recovered.
</span>All mergers require the balancing of different interests until everyone is more or less satisfied. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But this deal — which would have created the world’s third-largest automaker, with sales and factories all over the globe — stood apart for its varied stakeholders and the influential role of the French government.
</span>In the end, Fiat walked away when the Renault board asked for more time.
Here’s a look at what made this deal so difficult to close.
The French government had its demands.
Renault is often described as a crown jewel of French industry. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The government is under political pressure to save well-paying jobs, and national pride was at stake as it considered a tie-up with an Italian-American organization.
</span>It also had a stake in the deal. The government is Renault’s largest single shareholder, with <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15 percent</span> stake, and has a designated representative on the carmaker’s board.
Fiat’s proposal offered each company’s shareholders equal ownership of the new entity. The French government’s share would have been cut <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 7.5 percent</span>, but it would have kept a representative on the board.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the past week, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, sought reassurances as he met with company executives.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He wanted a corporate headquarters in Paris, and wanted job cuts in the United States and Italy before anyone in France would be affected, one person involved said.
</span>Fiat appeared willing to meet some or most of the government’s demands. But the company’s chairman, John Elkann, was intent on creating a company would not be seen as politically influenced — a perception that had plagued the relationship between Renault and Nissan.
The board met one day this week. Then another. Sometime around midnight on Wednesday, French negotiators “pulled the elastic until it broke,” said one person close to the talks.
Nissan needed more facts.
<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">For 20 years</span>, Renault and the Japanese automaker Nissan had a successful alliance sharing technology and design. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Now automakers are facing disruption because of changing technology, environmental demands, and a fall in global sales.</span> For legacy manufacturers like Renault and Nissan, alliances and mergers are essential.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But the architect of the Renault Nissan Alliance, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in November on charges of financial misconduct.</span> As he awaits trial, the automakers’ leaders — Jean-Dominique Senard, chairman of Renault, and Hiroto Saikawa, chief executive of Nissan — have been treating each other warily.
Initial talks between Renault and Fiat Chrysler were held behind Nissan’s back — the Japanese company said it was informed of the merger offer only hours before the it was formally announced.
On Monday, the eve of the board’s first meeting, Mr. Saikawa issued a statement that seemed like a warning, saying that a Fiat-Renault merger would “require a fundamental review of the existing relationship” to ensure that the Japanese automaker’s interests were protected.

“It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,” Fiat said in a statement announcing the withdrawal of the deal.

“Our partner is going to become a different company,” he continued. “It’s necessary to look that over from Nissan’s point of view, so we need some time.”"

The WSJ Dollar Index is an attempt to improve on existing indexes by basing its value on actual, up-to-date turnover by all participants in the foreign-exchange market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The index is proportionally weighted based on foreign-exchange trading volume data from the Bank for International Settlements' triennial central-bank survey on global foreign-exchange market activity.

</span>The methodology differs from other dollar indexes, including the benchmark ICE U.S. Dollar Index. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">For example, the ICE Dollar Index isn't regularly reweighted based on changes in trading volume.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It also varies from newer indexes like the FTSE Curex dollar index or the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index, which weigh the currencies in their respective indexes equally.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones FXCM index is owned by S&P/Dow Jones Indexes, a joint venture largely owned by McGraw-Hill and CME Group <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CME 0.27</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Dow Jones & Co., which publishes the Journal, has <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.6% stake</span> in the venture.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Every three years, when the BIS releases its new foreign-exchange market survey, the WSJ Dollar Index will be reweighted using the bank's latest trading volume figures, making it a dynamic index that evolves with the constantly changing market.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The WSJ Dollar Index captures more than two-thirds of daily global foreign-exchange trading volume, which is <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4 trillion</span> a day, according to the BIS's latest survey.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The index is restricted to dollar currency pairs that account for at <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 1% of</span> global daily turnover and that the BIS breaks out as major currency pairs.

</span>While the WSJ Dollar Index officially launched Wednesday, it has been back-calculated <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2001 to</span> provide historical context.

81433,"<h3>The making of Madison Cawthorn: How falsehoods helped propel the career of a new pro-Trump star of the far right</h3>Madison Cawthorn was a 21-year-old freshman at a conservative Christian college when he spoke at chapel, testifying about his relationship with God. He talked emotionally about the day a car accident left him partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair.
Cawthorn said a close friend had crashed the car in which he was a passenger and fled the scene, leaving him to die “in a fiery tomb.” Cawthorn was “declared dead,” he said in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 speech</span> at Patrick Henry College. He said he told doctors that he expected to recover and that he would “be at the Naval Academy by Christmas.”
Key parts of Cawthorn’s talk, however, were not true. The friend, Bradley Ledford, who has not previously spoken publicly about the chapel speech, said in an interview that Cawthorn’s account was false and that he pulled Cawthorn from the wreckage. An accident report obtained by The Washington Post said Cawthorn was “incapacitated,” not that he was declared dead. Cawthorn himself said in a lawsuit deposition, first reported by the news outlet AVL Watchdog, that he had been rejected by the Naval Academy before the crash.
Shortly after the speech, Cawthorn dropped out of the college after a single semester of mostly D’s, he said in the deposition, which was taken as part of a court case regarding insurance. Later, more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 former</span> students signed a letter accusing him of being a sexual predator, which Cawthorn has denied.
Yet four years after Cawthorn spoke at the chapel, the portrait he sketched of his life provided the framework for his election in November as the youngest member of the U.S. House at the minimum age <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 years</span> old. A campaign video ad repeated his false claim that the car wreck had derailed his plans to attend the Naval Academy.
He promptly used his newfound fame to push baseless allegations about voting fraud on Twitter in a video <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">viewed 4 million</span> times, which President Donald Trump retweeted, saying, “Thank you Madison!” Then Cawthorn spoke at the Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span></span> where a mob was incited to storm the U.S. Capitol, again alleging fraud and extolling the crowd’s courage in comparison with the “cowards” in Congress. He returned to the Capitol, where he falsely claimed that insurrectionists had been “paid by the Democratic machine.”
Today, less than two months after being sworn in, Cawthorn has emerged as one of the most visible figures among newly arrived publicity-hungry House Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who have promoted baseless assertions and pushed a radicalized ideology that has become a driving force in the GOP.
The story of Cawthorn’s rise is, by any measure, an extraordinary accomplishment at a young age by a man who suffered a horrific injury. But an examination by The Post of how he ascended so quickly shows how even one of the most neophyte elected Republicans is adopting the Trump playbook, making false statements about his background, issuing baseless allegations about voter fraud and demonizing his political opponents.
Cawthorn won his campaign with a brief résumé that included working at a Chick-fil-A, a part-time role in a congressional office, the single semester of college and fledgling work as a real estate investor. He was boosted by a last-<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minute $500,000 blitz</span> by a political action committee that trashed his primary opponent as a “Never Trumper,” which the opponent said was false. Cawthorn’s campaign website said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is Black, wanted to “ruin” White males running for office, an assertion Booker denounced as “rank racism.”
Cawthorn’s election also came despite an extraordinary effort by former classmates and other alumni of Patrick Henry College urging that the voters of North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District reject him on grounds of alleged sexual misconduct. Three women told The Post in on-the-record interviews that they objected to Cawthorn’s behavior, with one saying he tried forcibly to kiss her after she rejected his advance.
Cawthorn declined an interview request. His press secretary, Micah Bock, who went to college with him, declined to respond directly to a list of questions that he had asked The Post to send to the congressman. Instead, Bock said that voters responded to such questions by electing Cawthorn, although some of the events — such as his speech before the storming of the U.S. Capitol — happened after the election.
The young North Carolinian now presents himself as the future of his party, brashly proclaiming that “I will put the Republican establishment on my shoulders and drag them kicking and screaming back to the Constitution.” Cawthorn was a featured speaker Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, attacking “vicious” opponents who are “trying to take away all of our rights” and “are trying to turn this country into a communist ash heap.”
A crash in Florida
By his account, Cawthorn led a charmed life growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina. Handsome and athletic, he was home-schooled and played high school football. He sought admission to the U.S. Naval Academy under a process that enables a local member of Congress to recommend candidates.
That led Cawthorn to seek help from then-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C), a conservative co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus. As it happened, Cawthorn was friends with Meadows’s son, Blake. The senior Meadows agreed in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2013 to</span> nominate Cawthorn to the Naval Academy, but Cawthorn’s acceptance depended on his grades, test scores and other measures.
After the Naval Academy rejected Cawthorn’s application, he said in the deposition, he went on a spring break trip in Florida with his friend Ledford.
During <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2014 trip</span>, Cawthorn, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 18,</span> and Ledford, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 17,</span> traded positions between the driver and passenger seats while the vehicle was moving on the highway, Cawthorn said in his deposition. At the time, Cawthorn said, he thought he was invincible, “didn’t see any danger in it” and did it to save time.
The two were traveling back to North Carolina when Ledford nodded off while driving on <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 4 in</span> Florida and crashed into a concrete construction barrier, Ledford said in a deposition. Ledford said Cawthorn, while wearing a seat belt harness, had been sleeping in a “laid back position” in a manner that the harness did not touch Cawthorn’s body, and with “his feet being on the dash[board].”
Ledford said in his deposition that when the van crashed, he saw Cawthorn was unconscious. The doors were jammed, and the vehicle began to be enveloped in flames. Ledford said he exited through a window, “unbuckled Madison and proceeded to pull him out while a bystander came in and helped me.”
In his chapel address, however, Cawthorn told it this way: “He was my brother, my best friend. And he leaves me in a car to die in a fiery tomb. He runs to safety deep in the woods and just leaves me in a burning car as the flames start to lick my legs and curl up and burn my left side. Fortunately, there was several bystanders who come by and they break the window open that they pulled me out to safety and they sat me down. The paramedics arrive and decided that I’m gone and I have no pulse, I have no breath. And I was, I was declared dead on the scene. For whatever reason, may it be adrenaline or divine intervention, I definitely believe it’s the latter, I had a deep inhale of breath.""
Ledford said in an interview with The Post that he raced to save his friend’s life.
“That statement he made was false,” Ledford said. “It hurt very badly that he would say something as false as that. That is not all what happened. I pulled him out of the car the second that I was able to get out of the car.”
Ledford said the two didn’t talk for a couple of years. He said pressure regarding insurance claims caused Cawthorn to say “crazy things.” Ledford said he has reconnected with Cawthorn, and “he told me that he didn’t believe those things anymore.”
In his deposition, Cawthorn did not say his friend left him for dead. Instead, he said, “I have no memory from the accident.” An accident report and other records from the Florida Highway Patrol say Cawthorn was incapacitated and in critical condition, not that he was declared dead.
As a result of the accident, Cawthorn has limited use of his legs, uses a wheelchair, and received <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3 million</span> settlement from an insurance company, as well as other payments, and is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">seeking $30 million</span> more, according to court records from several lawsuits related to the case.
Cawthorn attributed his poor grades in college to “suffering from a brain injury after the accident definitely — I think it slowed my brain down a little bit,” he said in the deposition. “Made me less intelligent. And the pain also made reading and studying very difficult.”
‘I told him no’
Cawthorn underwent multiple surgeries. Eventually, with a modified car, he was able to drive again, and he soon began asking young women to go on what they say he called “fun drives.”
Katrina Krulikas, who was part of a home-schooling network that included Cawthorn, said she <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 17 years</span> old and he <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 19 when</span> they agreed to go on a date. She said in an interview that she got into his car and he drove to a “deserted part of town and he took me to the woods.”
They got out of the car and Cawthorn talked about sex, which made her feel uncomfortable. “All these very intimate, pressing questions that at the time, for someone that grew up in a very conservative community and hadn’t really talked about sex, I didn’t really know anyone having sex. … It was a very religious community.”
Cawthorn then made his move from his wheelchair, Krulikas said.
“He tries to kiss me and I say no and I don’t let him kiss me,” she said. “We talk for like a little bit longer, like a few minutes. And then suddenly” he moved forward “as if to try to kiss me so quickly that I wouldn’t have a choice to say no or push him away. And at this point, I’m so startled that I fall back. My hair gets stuck in his chair. I’m ripping my hair out, trying to get out of the situation.”
Returning home, Krulikas said she texted a friend that she would never feel comfortable being alone with Cawthorn again. At the time, she didn’t complain because she felt she had “put myself in that situation.” But as she grew older, she said, she believed Cawthorn deserved blame, and “I definitely would classify it as sexual assault because he knew I said no.”
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Krulikas first told of the encounter last August in World Magazine, a publication based in Asheville, N.C., that describes itself as “grounded in facts and biblical truth.”
Cawthorn, whose work experience had mainly been at a Chick-fil-A, got a part-time job working at the district office of then-Rep. Meadows.
</span>Cawthorn told the Asheville Citizen-Times that he had worked “full time” for Meadows <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Congressional records show Cawthorn was listed as a part-time employee <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span></span> was paid <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15,000.</span></span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> he received <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3,000 for</span> part-time work.
Cawthorn said in an earlier deposition he was accepted to Princeton and an online program at Harvard, along with other universities. He later revised his statements to say that he had not been admitted to Princeton and Harvard and that some of his statements about college admissions were “not accurate.”
Cawthorn eventually followed his friend Blake Meadows to become a student at Patrick Henry College, where the motto is “For Christ and Liberty.” In this conservative environment in Purcellville, Va., some female students said Cawthorn asked them to go on drives in his Dodge Challenger.
“He asked me to go on a ‘fun drive,’ ” said one classmate, Leah Petree. When she asked what that meant, Cawthorn “insinuated some sexual activity.” Petree said, “I had a boyfriend so I was I was not going in the car with him. I told him no.”
Nonetheless, Cawthorn continued to “pressure me and badger me.” One day in <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2016,</span> she said, she was in the cafeteria with other students when Cawthorn arrived with some of his friends. Petree said Cawthorn began asking another female student questions about sex that Petree deemed inappropriate, and she tried to defuse the situation.
“He got really angry and looked at me and screamed at me with a lot of anger,” Petree said. She recalled he said she was ""'just a little blond, slutty American girl.’ And I remember that quote very well. … I remember at the time my eyes stinging with tears, the whole table going quiet.”
Petree sent The Post a screenshot of a text conversation she later had with Cawthorn in which he complained that a man approached him and “said I called you a slut.” She texted back that she didn’t know the person’s identity, and he responded that “I have some old friends who would love to meet him.”
Some former students said in interviews that they were advised by classmates not to go on a drive with Cawthorn. But a student named Caitlin Coulter said in an interview that she was not aware of those concerns when Cawthorn asked her to ride with him in that fall semester of<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> She accepted.
Cawthorn took Coulter to “somewhere very rural,” she said.
“There was a specific point in which he grew frustrated and I shut him down, basically — by not responding to some of the advances he was making. And he got upset and he turned the car around and drove very, like, violently is the best way I can think of to describe it. Violently back to campus. It was very scary. … It seemed it was very clearly because he was upset that I had turned him down or refused his advances.”
After hurtling down back roads at speeds she said <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 70 or</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 80 miles</span> an hour, they returned to campus and she never heard from him again.
Cawthorn addressed the allegations this way during the campaign: “If I have a daughter, I want her to grow up in a world where people know to explicitly ask before touching her. If I had a son, I want him to be able to grow up in a world where he would not be called a sexual predator for trying to kiss someone.”
It was shortly after Coulter went on the ride with Cawthorn that he testified at chapel about his relationship with God. The semester was over. Cawthorn never returned and did not attend college elsewhere.
Running for Congress
Three years after Cawthorn dropped out of Patrick Henry College, Cawthorn learned Meadows planned to resign his seat to become chief of staff for President Donald Trump. Meadows and his wife, Debra, who was executive director of a political action committee called Women Right, backed their friend, Lynda Bennett, a real estate agent, in the Republican primary.
Cawthorn announced his candidacy. The 24-year-old was given little chance because of his youth and short résumé.
A campaign video ad said Cawthorn had planned to serve in the Navy “with a nomination to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. But all that changed in the spring <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014 when</span> tragedy struck.” His campaign website made a similar statement.
By his own admission, however, that was not true. He had been asked in his deposition whether the rejection by the Naval Academy “was before the accident?”
“It was, sir,” Cawthorn replied. That acknowledgment was not publicly known until after Cawthorn became the Republican nominee.
Bennett seemed the prohibitive favorite, given her backing by Mark and Debra Meadows. But Cawthorn said in a Facebook post in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2020 that</span></span> his campaign was thriving thanks to their son. He thanked “one of my closest friends, Blake Meadows,” for helping with the campaign. Blake Meadows did not respond to a request for comment.
Cawthorn also received crucial help from George Erwin Jr., a former sheriff of Henderson County and former executive director of the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police. Erwin helped the candidate gain endorsements from key law enforcement and political figures. He wrote on Facebook in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2020 that</span></span> “Congressman Cawthorn just has a sweet sound to it. I will do whatever I need to do to make this happen.”
Then came an extraordinary moment that turned the campaign in Cawthorn’s favor. Someone released an edited audio clip of Bennett saying forcefully, “I’m a Never Trump person. I don’t want Trump. I’m Never Trump, not going to vote for him.”
Bennett promptly denied that she was a Never Trumper, and soon a fuller audio clip was released that seemed to back her assertion that she had been mimicking someone who would never vote for Trump. She led the primary field but state law required that she <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 30 percent</span> of the vote. That led to a runoff between her and the runner-up, Cawthorn.
Bennett again was the favorite. But Cawthorn got an extraordinary boost from an outside group, a Georgia-based political action committee called Protect Freedom that sought to elect candidates in the mold of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) The group’s largest contributor is Jeff Yass, a co-founder of the Pennsylvania-based investment company Susquehanna International Group, who gave the PAC a total <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $8.5 million</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 and</span><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> according to federal election records. Yass declined to comment.
The committee <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">poured $500,000 into</span> the race to support Cawthorn in the days before the runoff. The money was mainly spent on mailers and television ads that renewed the charge that Bennett was a Never Trumper.
Bennett said in an interview that the last-minute spending on what she called a “lie” devastated her campaign, and she ran an ad blaming “Madison Cawthorn’s DC friends.” She said it proved impossible to convince many people that she had been mocking a Never Trumper, even when Trump endorsed her just before the election.
Michael Biundo, a spokesman for Protect Freedom, said in an interview that he believed the committee’s advertising “played a big role in the race.” He said the committee was aware that an audio clip had been released in which Bennett said she was not a Never Trumper but nonetheless decided to air that charge.
“We stand by what we put out there,” he said.
With the committee’s help, Cawthorn beat Bennett <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 31 points</span>. He vowed to be the most pro-Trump member of Congress, and the president soon backed him effusively, saying he’s “a terrific young man. … He’s going to be one of the greats.”
Embraced by Trump
After Cawthorn became the Republican nominee for the 11th District seat, his background was scrutinized by a local news outlet called AVL Watchdog, which first reported on the deposition in which Cawthorn acknowledged that he was rejected by the Naval Academy before the accident.
Cawthorn attacked one of the outlet’s reporters, Tom Fiedler, who previously had been editor in chief of the Miami Herald and dean of Boston University’s College of Communication. Fiedler, who had a home in Asheville, had volunteered for <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> campaign of Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is Black.
Cawthorn responded to Fiedler’s reporting by attacking his association with Booker. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Fiedler “quit his academia job in Boston to work for non-white males, like Cory Booker, who aims to ruin white males running for office,” a Cawthorn campaign website alleged, as first reported by the Bulwark.</span> Booker denounced the comment.
Cawthorn responded by saying, “The syntax of our language was unclear and unfairly implied I was criticizing Cory Booker.”
As Cawthorn headed to the general election, former classmates and other alumni at Patrick Henry College circulated the letter that leveled accusations against him.
“Cawthorn’s time at PHC was marked by gross misconduct towards our female peers, public misrepresentation of his past, disorderly conduct that was against the school’s student honor code, and self-admitted academic failings,” the letter said. “During his brief time at the college, Cawthorn established a reputation for predatory behavior. … We urge the voters of North Carolina to seriously reevaluate Madison Cawthorn’s candidacy in light of who he really is.”
After more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 alumni</span> signed the letter, the organizers hoped it would lead to Cawthorn’s defeat in the general election. He faced Democrat Moe Davis, a former director of the Air Force Judiciary.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Cawthorn, meanwhile, traveled to the Texas border on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 30 and</span>, echoing the views of a radicalized, far-right ideology, alleged that there was “a large group of cartels, kidnapping our American children and then taking them to sell them on a slave market, a sex slave market.”</span> He said that “tens of thousands of our children” were taken in what he called “one of the greatest atrocities I can imagine,” blaming the media for failing to focus on the matter.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">There’s no evidence that cartels have kidnapped large numbers of U.S. children and sold them on a slave market.
</span>The Republican Party, meanwhile, saw Cawthorn as a star and gave him a coveted slot speaking on the third night of its national convention. Seeking to combat questions about his youth, Cawthorn said that if viewers didn’t think young people could change the world, “you don’t know American history.” He said that “my personal favorite, James Madison, was <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 25 years</span> old when he signed the Declaration of Independence.”
In fact, Madison never signed the Declaration of Independence. He was known as the Father of the Constitution, which he signed.
‘It’s time to fight’
Running in a heavily Republican district, Cawthorn won by a 12-point margin against Davis, who said in an interview that his opponent “has got to be the least qualified member of Congress.”
Cawthorn became one of the most loyal defenders of Trump, who claimed falsely that <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> had been stolen from him. In a six-minute video posted to Twitter on Dec.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> Cawthorn said, “My first act as a member of Congress will be to object to the electoral college certification of <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span>.”
To justify his decision, he repeated a host of false and misleading claims about the election, accusing various state election officials of violating the law even though courts across the country and Trump’s own attorney general, William P. Barr, rejected these allegations.
“Voter fraud is common in America. Those who tell you otherwise are lying,” Cawthorn said in the video.
Cawthorn alleged that a number of states had violated the Constitution and their own laws. Cawthorn said “ballots were shoved into duffel bags and left in parks and gas stations.” He said Nevada “allowed dead people and out-of-state voters to flood the electoral system,” a baseless assertion. He said mail-in ballots “are wildly susceptible to fraud.”
“Fact-check that,” Cawthorn said, adding, “Do not let your vote be canceled by these bastards.”
In fact, voter fraud is rare, mail-in ballots have been almost entirely free of fraud for decades, no widespread fraud was found in the fall election, and courts across the country dismissed more <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 legal</span> challenges filed by the Trump campaign.
Cawthorn’s video, however, made an impression on one person in particular. Trump gleefully retweeted it on Jan.<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> (The Post asked Twitter whether Cawthorn’s tweet met its civic integrity standards. After the inquiry on Feb.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> Twitter attached the following statement to Cawthorn’s tweet: “This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.”)
Cawthorn was sworn in on Jan.<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span> he amped up his rhetoric, tweeting the following day that “the future of this Republic hinges on the actions of a solitary few. … It’s time to fight.” He was invited to speak at the Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span></span> and derided members of both parties.
“The Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans, hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice,” Cawthorn said, castigating members of his own party who “have no backbone” and deriding “the cowards of Washington, D.C., that I serve with.”
He urged the crowd to be part of a new Republican Party “that will go and fight. … Make your voice heard, because, do we love Donald Trump? But my friends, we’re not just doing this for Donald Trump, we are doing this for the Constitution. Our Constitution was violated.”
Cawthorn then went to the Capitol and, after taking refuge from some of the same people who had listened to his address, called into the Charlie Kirk radio show and made an incendiary, baseless claim that Democrats were behind the insurrection.
“I believe this was agitators strategically placed inside of this group,” Cawthorn said. “You can call them ‘antifa,’ you can call them people paid by the Democratic machine, but to make the Trump campaign, the Trump movement, look bad and to make this look like it was a violent outrage when really the battle is being fought by people like myself and other great patriots who were standing up against the establishment, standing up against this tyranny in our country.” He said the storming of the Capitol was “disgusting, impermissible.”
No evidence has emerged that Democrats or antifa, the anti-fascist protest movement, were behind the insurrection.
Cawthorn was among <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 139 House</span> Republicans who voted to object to the certification of some presidential election results. The Democratic Party of North Carolina’s 11th District, which covers western parts of the state, has called for an investigation into what it calls Cawthorn’s “seditious behavior.”
As the blowback mounted, Cawthorn defended his actions but changed his tone. Asked about his rally speech during an interview on OZY, he said: “If I could go back, I wouldn’t have changed any words that I did say, but I probably would have added some lines. I probably would have encouraged more peace.”
Without any mention of his video baselessly alleging massive voting irregularities, he said that he hadn’t promoted theories about fraudulent voting machines or “U-Hauls being backed up with tons of ballots and they were fraudulently marked. I couldn’t have personally proved that … so I definitely didn’t try and feed into that narrative.”
Erwin, the former sheriff who helped Cawthorn get endorsements, said in an interview that he increasingly is regretful for playing a crucial role in the election.
Erwin went on Facebook after the Capitol riot and wrote: “I apologize to all of my law enforcement friends, other politicians, family and friends — I was wrong, I misled you. When I saw [Cawthorn’s] speech to the crowd in Washington I thought this is not good. … Your words can incite or calm. I saw no calming words and people died and were injured.”
Erwin confirmed that he wrote the post and expressed profound remorse. “I was filled with hope for him,” Erwin said. “And that hope was dashed and it was crushed. And that’s on me. That’s why I had to apologize to folks.”
Republican House leaders, meanwhile, rewarded Cawthorn with assignments that belied his background of a single college semester of mostly D’s and rejection by the Naval Academy. He now serves on the Education Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

83643,"<h3>China Producer Prices Turn Negative in Warning Sign for Global Economy</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">SINGAPORE—Prices charged by Chinese companies at the factory gate recorded their first annual fall in almost two years, another downbeat signal for the global economy as bulging inventories and cautious consumers in the West hit overseas demand for Chinese-made goods.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Chinese producer prices <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.3% in</span> October compared with a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, the country’s first year-over-year decline in producer-price inflation since <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2020.</span>
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The decline reflects weaker prices for the producers of raw materials following a recent pullback in commodity prices, as well as a high base for comparison because of rapid price rises a year earlier.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The data come on the heels of ugly export figures released Monday that showed a surprise drop in Chinese exports to the rest of the world last month.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Taken together, the weakness in the world’s second-largest economy points to a global economy that is losing steam as central banks led by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. ratchet up interest rates to contain rocketing inflation.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Many economists expect a recession in the U.S. within the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 12 months</span>.</span> Europe is already on the brink of a downturn as Russia strangles the region’s gas supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions slapped on it following its invasion of Ukraine.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The drop in producer-price inflation in China comes alongside a monthslong slide in shipping rates, which together should offer a degree of relief on goods-price inflation for consumers in the U.S. and Europe.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">However, central bankers in many advanced economies, the U.S. especially, say that inflationary pressures have broadened to services prices and wages and that further interest-rate rises are needed to bring price growth under control.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“If we see a drop back in goods inflation, that helps address some of the inflation problem, but not all,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1.3% annual</span> decline in producer prices <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">follows 12 months</span> of slowing growth.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a slightly larger decline, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.5%.</span></span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Data showed prices for metals and capital goods fell but prices for some consumer products held steady or rose, albeit marginally.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Consumer-price inflation in China also retreated sharply in October, underscoring feeble spending in the world’s second-largest economy as consumers grapple with the government’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 and a severe property crunch.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Consumer prices <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.1% in</span> October from a year earlier, down from <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.8% gain</span> in September.
</span>That was the weakest reading since May, when Shanghai was in the midst of a two-month lockdown to contain a flare-up of Covid-19. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Economists polled by the Journal had expected <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.3% annual</span> rise in consumer prices in October.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Inflation in China has so far this year remained below the government’s preferred ceiling of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3%,</span> in contrast with above-target gains in most other countries as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That has given the People’s Bank of China considerable latitude to reduce interest rates and offer banks cheap loans to support growth, though officials are wary of easing too much because of worries over a weak currency and capital fleeing the country.
</span>Chinese health officials said Saturday that China would stick to its tough Covid-prevention strategy, dashing hopes that had built up in recent days for an easing of strict pandemic measures following a closely watched Communist Party congress last month. The number of reported Covid-19 cases in China on Tuesday was the highest since late April, prompting authorities to tighten public-health controls in areas including the southern coastal province of Guangdong.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">With growth slowing in the U.S., Europe and China, economists are downbeat about the global economy’s prospects this year and next.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund warned last month that “the worst is yet to come,” saying it expects global gross domestic product to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expand 3.2% this</span> year, down <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6% in</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> before slowing <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.7% in</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2023.</span>

39581,"<h3>Global Deal Making Falls to Slowest Pace in 20 Years</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Global Deal Making Falls to Slowest Pace <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 20 Years</span>
Companies held back by proposed changes to U.S. tax and trade rules, higher valuations
Corporate deal-making has hit a rough patch despite robust stock and bond markets that in the past have led to a deluge of such activity.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mergers and acquisitions this year have slid to their lowest level globally in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 20 years</span> because valuations as well as political and economic uncertainty are making potential buyers wary.
</span>The number of deals world-wide involving publicly traded targets this year fell <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 793 as</span> of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 28,</span> according to Dealogic, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 20% from</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 991 in</span> the comparable period last year and the lowest number <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1998.</span>
Meanwhile, companies are paying higher multiples for acquisitions and investments. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Buyers paid an average <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 12.8 times</span> the target’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization so far this year, up <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 12.1 for</span> the comparable period <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 and</span> the highest year-to-date multiple <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1997.</span></span> The value of deals globally, however, is <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 13.9% year</span> to date <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $479.8 billion</span>. Dealogic figures exclude spinoffs, and include minority investments.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Prospects for overhauls of U.S. corporate tax and trade policy along with concerns about Britian’s plan to leave the European Union are prompting management to hit the pause button on deal activity.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Rising stock prices and deal valuations are adding to their hesitation.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Executives today want more clarity on issues such as tax reform and trade policy, said Robert Profusek, global head of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Jones Day.
</span>They are taking the attitude of “don’t shoot until you have to,” he said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ongoing debates about tax reform, trade policy and corporate regulation have left companies unsure about business prospects, either their own or that of potential targets.
</span>The uncertainty encourages companies to focus only on high-priority deals, for which they are willing to pay top dollar. “This could kill or delay the marginal deals,” said Brian Langenberg, principal at research firm Langenberg & Co.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Last month, medical-supplies maker Becton, Dickinson & Co. said it would buy C.R. Bard Inc. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $24 billion</span>, or more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Ebitda</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 6.4 times</span> sales, according to Dealogic.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Research firm Morningstar Inc., in an analyst note, said the price represented <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 60% premium</span> to its stand-alone valuation of C.R. Bard.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Acquirers typically have paid <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 times</span> sales for medical-products companies, according to Morningstar.

5383,"<h3>‘It was my job, and I didn’t find him’: Stoneman Douglas resource officer remains haunted by massacre</h3>BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — Scot Peterson had spent much of the past three months in hiding, but now somebody was walking onto his porch and toward the front door. A motion detector activated an alarm inside his duplex. Peterson,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> ducked away from the windows and bent out of sight. His girlfriend, Lydia Rodriguez, walked to the entryway and began to pull down a corner of the white sheet that now covered most of their front door. “Oh please,” she said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“What now?”
It had been <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exactly 90 days</span> since Peterson’s last shift as a school resource officer in Parkland, Fla., where he had been armed and on duty <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 17 people</span> were killed <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 17 more</span> were injured, and ever since then a procession had been making its way to his door to demand accountability for another American mass shooting.</span> First came the Broward County Sheriff’s Office to repossess his police cruiser and his badge. Then came dozens of reporters and television trucks, jamming into the cul-de-sac of a retirement community to broadcast stories about the “Coward of Broward.” Then came a court officer serving Peterson with a lawsuit from a parent whose daughter had been fatally shot on the school’s third floor. “Scot Peterson is a coward,” it read. “Scot Peterson did nothing. Scot Peterson waited and listened to the din of screams of teachers and students, many of who were dead and dying. He let innocent people die.”
“I’m not here,” Peterson said now to Rodriguez as she looked out beyond the sheet and sunlight streamed into their living room.
“It’s okay,” she said, waving at two octogenarians holding a bag of cookies on the porch. “It’s the neighbors. Jim and Kelly.”
Peterson invited them inside and offered them seats in the living room. Christian music played over the speakers and Fox News Channel was muted on television. “Thank God for you two,” Peterson told them. They were two of the only people who had come over after the shooting just to ask if he was okay. As the crowds grew outside his house, they had let him sneak out his back door and through their yard whenever he left to see his lawyer, visit a psychologist, or go for a drive when he couldn’t sleep.
“How are you managing?” Kelly asked.
“I have some okay moments,” he said.
“We’ve been worried,” Jim said. “We’ve been watching the news.”
“Oh yeah? What are they saying?” Peterson asked, even though he had already heard what they were saying and couldn’t stop himself from hearing it, even now. “A disgrace,” the sheriff had said during a news conference. “An awful human being,” one survivor said on national television. “A blight on law enforcement,” said a police union. “A coward,” said President Trump. “When it came time to get in there and do something, he didn’t have the courage.”
Their words ran in a loop through his head, because all this time Peterson had been wondering, too: What more could he possibly have done? Why had he failed to save so many lives in the exact scenario he had spent so much of his career training for — to find and kill an active shooter? He had worked as a sheriff’s deputy <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 32 years</span>, as a school resource officer <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 28,</span> and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for nearly a decade. He was the lone deputy stationed at the school, sworn to serve and protect a community of students who called him “Dep,” honored him with awards, and invited him to proms and football games.
He had been admired and maybe even beloved up until a former student named Nikolas Cruz allegedly arrived at school with an AR-15. And ever since, Peterson had been living inside those next seven minutes. He had briefly considered changing his name or moving out of state, but even if he could somehow outrun infamy and embarrassment, he had decided there was no escape from the questions and doubts that consumed him.
“It’s haunting,” Peterson said now. “I’ve cut that day up a thousand ways with a million different what-if scenarios, but the bottom line is I was there to protect, and I <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 17.</span>”
“Come on, now,” Jim said. “It’s not all on you.”
“But that’s the perception,” Peterson said. “You’re a hero or a coward, and that’s it.”
“People are looking for someone to point to and blame,” Jim said. “They’re just trying to make sense of it.”
“I know,” Peterson said. “So am I.”
***
It was in some ways the simplest kind of crime to solve: committed by one perpetrator who had surrendered and then confessed within an hour. And yet, months later half a dozen inquiries remained underway, each an attempt to derive sense and order from seven chaotic minutes. The FBI was reviewing its threat response. A governor’s commission was examining school security failures. The sheriff’s office was looking into radio malfunctions. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating the sheriff’s office.
Peterson had been doing his own investigating, too, studying dozens of pages of documents inside his duplex. He had rewatched surveillance footage and read witness statements, searching for a way to reconcile the deputy he believed he was with the coward who was maligned each day in the national news.
“How can they keep saying I did nothing?” he asked Rodriguez one morning, looking again through the documents on his kitchen table. “I’m getting on the radio to call in the shooting. I’m locking down the school. I’m clearing kids out of the courtyard. They have the video and the call logs. The evidence is sitting right there.”
“It’s easy to second-guess when you’re in some conference room, spending months thinking about what you would have done,” Rodriguez said.
“There wasn’t even time to think,” Peterson said. “It just happened, and I started reacting.”
He remembered being in his office on the afternoon of Feb.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14 when</span> the first call came in to his school radio, as he was waiting to meet with a parent about a student’s fake driver’s license. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">On most days, that was his job: to police the small stuff — to chase down stolen cellphones, confiscate marijuana, lecture students for vaping in class, and break up the occasional hallway fight.</span> Twice he had caught students with knives, but not once in the past decade had he encountered a gun. Stoneman Douglas was a high-achieving suburban school, with Audis in the student parking lot and packed PTA meetings each month. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The school employed eight security guards to help <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">monitor 13 buildings</span> spread <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 45 acres</span>, but Peterson was the only person who carried a gun.
</span>“If I have to arrest you, then something has gone wrong,” Peterson often told students, because his role was less to be an enforcer of the law than a friendly reminder of it. He had worked before as a corrections guard and as a road officer arriving at the scenes of fatal car crashes and homicides, but it was his work as a school resource officer that had made him one of the most decorated deputies in Parkland.
“Possible firecracker,” came the call in to his school radio at 2:21 p.m., from one of the school’s eight full-time security guards. “Firecracker over by <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>.”
Peterson had dealt with fireworks on campus before, and if there were ever a likely time for one, it was now, during the last class period on Valentine’s Day. “Probably a few kids acting like idiots,” Peterson remembered thinking, and he stood from his desk and walked out to investigate. His office was a few hundred yards from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>, and he was heading in that direction with a security guard when a fire alarm went off. Smoke from the firecracker had probably triggered the alarm, Peterson remembered thinking.
He began running toward <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> until one of the unarmed security guards swung by in a golf cart and offered him a ride. Peterson climbed onto the back and jumped off the cart <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 yards</span> from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>. The security guard drove away, and Peterson took a few steps toward the building before he heard two loud bangs. They didn’t sound like firecrackers. Maybe gunshots, he thought.
He remembered being unsure whether the blasts were coming from outside or inside the building, or if someone was firing shots in the adjacent parking lot or sniping from the roof. He didn’t know, and no one was there to tell him, and he remembered reacting in those first seconds by doing what he believed he had been trained to do: taking cover in a tactical position so he could clear the area. He leaned his back against the wall of an adjacent building. He took out his gun and scanned the surrounding palm trees, the courtyard, the windows, the parking lot and the roof. He waved at students who were walking through the courtyard and told them to clear the area. He reached for his school radio and gave a “Code Red” to lock down the school. He picked up his police radio for the first time just after 2:23 p.m.
“Please advise, we have possible, uh, could be firecrackers. I think we got shots fired. Possible shots fired,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span>,” he said, according to a recording of the radio traffic.
He remembered standing for the next several seconds with his back against the wall, scanning the area around the building for a possible shooter. Trees. Roof. Windows. Courtyard. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. He could see much of campus from his position, but he couldn’t find a shooter. He remembered staying in place because he didn’t want to expose himself when he didn’t know where the shots were coming from. He remembered feeling certain the gunshots were coming from somewhere near or inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>, but where?
“Make sure we get some units over here,” he said into the radio, still at 2:23 p.m. “I need to shut down Stoneman Douglas, the intersection.”
“We’re talking about <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>,” he said, a few seconds later.
“We don’t have any description yet,” he said, at 2:24. “We just hear shots, what appear to be shots fired.”
How often had he envisioned this moment? How much time had he spent studying other mass shootings, imaging himself on scene, wondering how he would react? He had gone to annual conferences about school shootings, taken a class on confronting active shooters and led annual lockdown trainings for teachers. He had started his career as a school resource officer years before <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1999 shooting</span> at Columbine High School in Colorado, back when the idea of a school shooting seemed far-fetched, but now it was a possibility he carried in his mind as he walked around campus each day.
There were always a few students the administration worried about, and three years earlier one had been caught with written plans for how to shoot up the school. Peterson had imagined what he would do if someone started firing in the crowded courtyard during lunch or at halftime of a football game. The ending he imagined was always the same: He identified the shooter. He engaged the shooter. He killed the shooter.
But now he stood against the wall, holding his radio in one hand and his gun in the other. He remembered wondering why he could not locate the shots. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. The fire alarm was still blaring. Police sirens were closing in from all directions. From Peterson’s position, he could see only the east side entrance to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>. Meanwhile, on the west side, at least one victim was already down.
Students inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> were at that very moment <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooding 911 with</span> calls describing the exact location and description of the shooter, but it turned out that those calls were being routed not to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office but instead to the bordering Coral Springs Police Department. Coral Springs officers were not yet on the scene, and even once they arrived, they communicated on a separate radio system from Peterson and the rest of Broward County. The only information being relayed to him was coming out of his Broward County radio, a soundtrack first of silence and then of mounting confusion as the shooting continued into its fourth minute.
“I hear shots fired by the football field!” shouted the second Broward County deputy to arrive. “Shots by the football field.”
“Some thought it was firecrackers. We’re not sure,” said the next deputy on site. “By the football field.”
“We also heard it over by, inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>,” Peterson said, still standing in place. “We are locking down the school right now.”
“I got more students running west toward the football field,” another officer said.
“I hear shots fired,” Peterson said. “Shots — ”
“I have a gunshot victim,” said another deputy. “He is by the entrance to West Glades, on the west side of the school.”
“Does he know where the shooter is?” Peterson shouted, but now it was already six minutes into the massacre, and the last victim had already been shot on the third floor. The gunman was dropping his AR-15 near the stairwell and then heading out of the building, blending in with the crowd of frantic students. The shooting Peterson was supposed to stop was already over.
A Coral Springs SWAT team arrived almost five minutes later to clear the building, and Peterson left his position against the wall and ran to give the team his set of master keys to the classroom doors. He passed by the entrance of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> for the first time, and there in the hall he could see two victims. He still didn’t know whether there were more. He still didn’t know anything about the identity or the location of the shooter. He stayed on the scene for the next several hours, helping to move bodies as the death toll mounted, and later that night he went home to Rodriguez.
She had been sure he was dead the moment she heard the report of “one victim” on the television news. They had talked dozens of time about how he would be the first person through the door to confront a shooter. But instead, here he was, stammering over his words, the grief and self-doubt already beginning as he tried to make sense of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">why 17 people</span> were dead <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 17 were</span> injured and the only dirt on his uniform was from where his back had been pressed against the wall.
“I couldn’t get him,” he remembered telling Rodriguez that day, before anyone else had begun to assign blame. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It was my job, and I didn’t find him.”
</span>***
In his sleep, he was still looking, still scanning the roof, windows and courtyard, only to awaken each morning to the fresh realization of the same result. He had gone to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist after the shooting, and he had come home with a prescription to help him sleep and a sheet describing the symptoms he had begun to experience: “Confusion.” “Anxiety.” “Guilt.” “Grief.” “Agitation.” “Obsession.”
“Why didn’t I hear more shots?” he said one morning, sifting again through the manila folder as Rodriguez sat nearby. “It doesn’t make sense. I should have heard them, but I didn’t.”
“Relax,” she said, putting her hand on his.
“I only remember hearing two or three,” he said. “I know there were more, but that’s all I heard.”
“Let it be,” she said, even though she knew that wasn’t possible, because she had heard Peterson turn each detail of the shooting into a self-interrogation, a cycle of blame and abdication that could sometimes last all day. Maybe he hadn’t heard more shots because of the fire alarm, or because of his positioning in the courtyard, or because the thick hurricane windows in <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> muffled the sound of gunfire. Or maybe it was the explanation his psychologist had offered, about the ways a traumatic experience could affect cognitive function, compressing memories, narrowing focus, clouding vision and distorting sound.
“If I heard more shots, I might have known where to find him,” Peterson said.
“If I knew where he was, I could have gone in.”
“If I’d gone in . . .” he continued, and Rodriguez squeezed his shoulder before he could finish the thought.
“Let’s get some air,” she said. She moved the sheet and looked outside to make sure nobody was there. Then they leashed the dog and walked out into a retirement development of cul-de-sacs, palm trees and rows of identical duplexes. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Rodriguez had just retired from teaching, and lately she considered it her job to support Peterson and keep him from “sinking too deep down inside his own head,” she said.</span> He hadn’t eaten or slept for two days after the shooting, sick with what he assumed was survivor’s guilt, even though nobody else had begun to publicly question his response.
In those first days, the sheriff’s office had invited him to shake Trump’s hand and be congratulated along with other first responders, but Peterson had chosen to stay home. “Nothing good happened that day,” he remembered telling his supervisor.
He gave his official statement to homicide investigators two days after the massacre, attended two funerals, and used sick days to finish out the first week. He was just preparing to return to work when he got a call from internal affairs eight days after the shooting. The sheriff’s office had reviewed surveillance tapes and watched as Peterson stood against the wall. Sheriff Scott Israel offered him two choices: He could be suspended indefinitely without pay, or he could retire with his full pension, an annual payment of <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100,000.</span>
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Peterson had little money saved, two ex-wives, alimony payments and a mortgage on the duplex he had bought out of foreclosure <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $100 down</span>.</span> He didn’t see it as a choice. He signed his retirement papers, and about an hour later the sheriff called a news conference to release more details about the shooting. The country was demanding an explanation, and for the first time he gave them something or someone to blame.
“One deputy was remiss, dereliction of duty,” Israel said. “And that’s Peterson.”
Rodriguez had tried to cushion all that came next with positivity — with Christian music, prayer and aphorisms framed in every corner of the house. “Rule your mind, or it will rule you,” read one. “Cherish Yourself!” “Create Your Own Happiness!” She had disconnected their TV, booked vacations in the mountains of North Carolina and covertly texted his old friends from the sheriff’s office, nudging them to reach out and call. But on some days, Peterson still seemed unreachable, including now, back on his tablet as he scanned recent headlines.
“Cowardly cop gets princely pension,” read one, and he groaned and flipped along.
“Parkland Parent: ‘Peterson is the lowest form of life.’ ”
“When does it end?” Peterson said, eyes still on the screen.
“Where are you? Come back,” Rodriguez said, but Peterson didn’t seem to hear her. He looked at the tablet, where a little while later he saw a new headline, a breaking news alert. “School shooting in Texas,” it read. “Several dead.”
“Dear God. Not again,” he said, and he turned off the Christian music and flipped on the television in time to see an aerial view of Santa Fe High School surrounded by helicopters, ambulances and police cars. Frantic students ran in every direction. A confused parent stammered through an interview. “My daughter. Where’s my daughter?” she said.
“I really shouldn’t watch this,” Peterson said, his voice beginning to crack, but he kept his eyes on the screen. He watched them load the ambulances. He watched a SWAT team enter the school. He watched as the sheriff held his first news conference, promising “accountability and answers.” He watched as a somber news anchor came on screen to <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">confirm 10 dead</span> and several more wounded, including a school resource officer in critical condition.
“Unlike in Parkland, this time the deputy went in,” the anchor said, and Peterson braced to hear his name.
“A case study in the difference between heroism and cowardice,” the anchor said, and now Peterson was shrinking deeper into the couch and into his head.
He had read that the gunman fired more <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 rounds</span>. Why had he heard only two or three?
“We all remember how in that case the deputy just waited outside, knowing full well . . . ” the anchor began to say, but before he could finish, Peterson reached for the remote and turned it off.
***
It was true that he had never gone into <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> that day, neither during the shooting nor after, and now the closest he could come was by watching a video he had found while looking for information about the shooting on his computer. It was a schematic animation of the crime scene that investigators had made using surveillance footage <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 15 cameras</span> in the school. “A little like Pac-Man,” was how one investigator had described the animation, because <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> had been turned into a 3-D architectural sketch, the gunman was represented by a roving black rifle, and the students had become colored dots.
It was a version of a mass shooting with no gunfire, no blood, no screaming, no shattering glass and no hallways obscured by smoke. Here, the chaos had been rendered into something silent and orderly, time-stamped to the one-hundredth of a second. Peterson enlarged the video on his screen and hit play.
“As people are injured, their green dots will become yellow,” the narrator said. “Fatalities will turn gray.”
“Oh, not the dots,” Rodriguez called out from the kitchen, because she had watched the video with Peterson once and thought that was probably enough.
“It helps me if I can see it,” he said. “It clears up my thinking.”
So Peterson watched as the black rifle that represented Cruz entered the building on the first floor at 2:21:23 p.m., and he watched seven seconds later as the first two dots turned gray in the main corridor. <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Within 20 seconds</span>, two more students were dead and four more were injured. <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Within 80 seconds</span>, a total of eight were dead <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 11 injured</span>.
“That first burst of gunfire is probably what triggered the firecracker call on the school radio and then the fire alarm,” Peterson said as he watched dots scatter across the scene. “I’m still running out of my office. I haven’t even gotten over there. What am I supposed to do?”
He watched as the black rifle stopped at four classrooms on the first floor, shooting through doors and windows, circling back to fire more rounds at injured victims as dots turned from green to yellow to gray. A green dot entered the hall from outside and came into the corridor, moving purposefully toward the shooter.
“Oh, God. That’s Chris,” Peterson said, meaning his friend Chris Hixon, one of the school’s security guards who had run into the building despite being unarmed. Peterson wondered whether Hixon, who also was the school’s athletic director, had gone in expecting to find a few kids with firecrackers, or whether he had somehow figured out a shooting was underway. “Was he trying to stop it? Was he hoping to tackle him?” Peterson said, but now he watched as the black rifle turned in Hixon’s direction, and his dot turned yellow as he was hit for the first time. The yellow dot raced behind a wall for cover. The black gun moved closer, taking its time, until it and the yellow dot were side by side.
“A damn monster,” Peterson said, backing away from the screen as Hixon’s dot went from yellow to gray. Eleven dead <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 injured</span> in less than two minutes. The black rifle began up the stairs toward the second floor at 2:23:28, about the same time Peterson called in to the police radio to report possible fireworks or gunshots at the school.
“Now I’m finally getting near there,” Peterson said, as he watched the black rifle move methodically through the second floor, finding no victims but firing rounds that traveled through doors and then out windows.
“I was trying to figure it out,” Peterson said again. “I was scanning for the shooter, looking over the windows, the sidewalk, the rooftop. I thought maybe it was a sniper like in Las Vegas. I just didn’t know.”
Peterson watched on screen as the black rifle continued unabated up the stairs to the third floor, arriving on the landing at 2:24:30. The hall was crowded with students evacuating because of the fire alarm. Some would later tell investigators that they didn’t realize an active shooter was in the building. Like Peterson, they had not been able to hear or place the gunshots that were coming from the first floor. Dozens of them sprinted for the stairs as the gunman opened fire, reloading as he traveled up and down the hall, killing six more students and injuring four before he shot his last victim at 2:25:19.
“I was right outside,” Peterson said, pausing the video, rewinding it, sitting again through <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">those<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49 seconds</span></span> when he was standing against a wall and the gunman was shooting on the third floor. On the screen, the shooting appeared clear and the tactical response seemed obvious. Peterson traced his finger over the stairs. “I could have come in over here,” he said. “I could have got him while he was reloading. If I’d just heard more shots, maybe I would have known where they were coming from.”
Maybe then, he said,<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49 seconds</span> would have been enough to do something. Maybe, he said, he would have left the wall and sprinted into the building. Maybe, he said, he would have known to run directly to the third floor, rather than clearing the first two floors. Maybe, he said, he would have located the shooter through the dust and smoke and fleeing students. Maybe, he said, he would have <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">harnessed 20 years</span> of training and steadied his gun on the target. Maybe, he said, his Glock would have proved enough to outgun an AR-15.
“It was all so fast,” he said. “I couldn’t piece it all together.”
“Stop torturing yourself,” Rodriguez said.
“It’s brutal,” he said, but he watched until the last dot turned gray and the black rifle moved down the stairs and out of the school.
***
He didn’t want to answer his phone. He didn’t want to take the sheet off the front door, leave the house or risk being seen, so instead he was back on his tablet one morning when a message arrived from another former school resource officer in Parkland, offering a time to meet for breakfast. “Go,” Rodriguez told Peterson, so he chose a diner in Boca Raton where no one would recognize him. He <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drove 30 minutes</span> and then sat down in a booth across from Frank Wear.
“Convenient spot,” Wear teased.
“I can’t go back into Broward,” Peterson said. “I don’t want to run into anyone. I just — I don’t even know what I would say.”
“No, I get it,” Wear said, because they had been friends for more than a decade. They had gone together to active-shooter trainings and taken a motorcycle trip to celebrate Wear’s retirement <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> Wear knew Peterson as a good cop, thorough and fair. “He had a pulse on everything happening over at Douglas,” Wear said, and that had also included Nikolas Cruz. Peterson had met with Cruz in the fall <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016 and</span> warned him against carrying a backpack decorated with Nazi insignia and racial slurs. He had requested a mental health evaluation after a classmate said that Cruz allegedly drank gasoline. He had even suggested that counselors use Florida’s Baker Act to have Cruz involuntarily committed, but a health expert wrote that Cruz “did not meet criteria for further assessment.” So instead Cruz had left school, and Peterson had gone back to dealing with a dozen other troubled students until a year later, when Cruz suddenly returned.
“The thing I keep coming back to is all those shots,” Peterson said now. “I heard two or three. It’s like my focus narrowed and maybe parts got cloudy.”
“I’ve been there,” Wear said, and he began to tell the story of a time when he had been the first officer to arrive at a scene, back <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span> He had caught two men in the middle of an armed robbery in Deerfield Beach and chased them through the neighborhood by car, eventually ramming his cruiser into their vehicle. The men wore “Scream” masks and carried a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol, and one fired at Wear as he took cover and shot back. He remembered his heart beating in his ears. He remembered the hazy feeling of time passing in slow motion as he killed one assailant and then helped apprehend the other.
“Talk about performing under pressure,” Peterson said. “Your life was on the line.”
“I just reacted,” Wear said.
“Still,” Peterson said. “It was heroic.”
“I feel stupid talking about this,” Wear said. He shifted in his seat and looked down at his coffee. On a television in the far corner of the restaurant, the news replayed images from the school shooting in Texas. An ambulance raced onto the school track. A team of police officers rushed into the building. Peterson sat in silence for a few seconds and moved the eggs around on his plate.
“Look, you were one guy, and you had communications failures, no information, just chaos,” Wear said. “We’re not all Rambo.”
“They keep saying I did nothing,” Peterson said. “A coward.”
And now he was retreating back into his head, returning again to the wall outside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> as his food went cold and the wait staff switched over from breakfast to lunch. “I was looking for him,” he said, scanning again over the courtyard, the windows and the rooftop in his mind, trying and failing to make sense out of another mass shooting.
“I just didn’t know,” he said. “Why didn’t I know to go in?”"
29578,"<h3>Trump Steps Up Attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Trump Steps Up Attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell
President says central banker ‘almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates’
WASHINGTON—President Trump escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying the head of the nation’s central bank threaten U.S. economic growth and appeared to enjoy raising interest rates.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">In an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump acknowledged the independence the Fed has long enjoyed in setting economic policy, while also making clear he was intentionally sending a direct message to Mr. Powell that he wanted lower interest rates.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Powell “almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The president declined to elaborate, and a spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment.
</span>Mr. Trump said it was “too early to say, but maybe” he regrets nominating Mr. Powell.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Fed officials have raised their benchmark rate three times this year, most recently in September to a range <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25%,</span> and most officials expect to raise it again at their December meeting.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell has said the Fed wants to raise rates at least to a so-called neutral level that seeks to neither spur nor slow economic growth.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The president’s caustic comments about Mr. Powell came as Mr. Trump repeatedly described the economy in personal terms.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He referred to economic gains during his time in office as “my numbers,” saying, “I have a hot economy going.”</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He described his push for growth as a competition with former President Obama’s record, saying that increases under his Democratic predecessor were skewed because of low-interest rates.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the 30-minute interview in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump also touched on his approach to tariffs, the controversy unfolding over the death of Saudi Arabian dissident Jamal Khashoggi, his eagerness to pass a second tax cut, and his thoughts on his former attorney, Michael Cohen.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Asked an open-ended question about what he viewed as the biggest risks to the economy, Mr. Trump gave a single answer: the Fed.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“To me the Fed is the biggest risk, because I think interest rates are being raised too quickly,” the president said just before he pushed a red button on his desk, summoning an iced cola delivered to him on a silver platter.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said that higher interest rates add to the debt and would act as a drag on economic growth.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said he preferred to take the savings from lower interest rates to pay down the debt.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“But how do you do that when he keeps raising interest rates on you?”
With the economy expanding solidly, unemployment falling and inflation running at the Fed’<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span>, the Fed has been gradually raising rates to guard against the risk of unsustainable growth, which could show up in the form of higher inflation or financial bubbles.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Asked why he thought Mr. Powell was raising rates, Mr. Trump paused, then said, “He was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy.</span> It’s turned out that he’s not.”
Mr. Trump demurred when asked under what circumstances he’d remove Mr. Powell, who he selected for a four-year term that started in February. “I don’t know,” he said. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“I’m just saying this: I’m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates.”
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">He said the Fed was supposed to be independent “in theory,” but said his instinct was that interest rates are being raised too quickly.
</span>Citing the rate increases, Mr. Trump said, “How the hell do you compete with that? <span id=""18"" class=""red"">And Obama — remember this, it’s very important — Obama had zero interest,” the president said.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The Fed held interest rates at ultralow levels for years after the financial crisis amid anemic growth both in the U.S. and abroad, and began slowly lifting rates in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015.</span>
</span>The law isn’t clear about whether Mr. Trump could dismiss Mr. Powell even if he wanted to do so. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve Act, as amended <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1935,</span> says Fed governors can be removed by the president “for cause.”</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The stipulation applies to the board’s governors, who serve 14-year terms, and not to the Fed chairman, who serves a four-year term concurrent with a 14-year term as governor.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The Fed has enjoyed relative independence in setting policy because it is charged by Congress with making sometimes-unpopular decisions, such as when to raise rates.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Before Mr. Trump, the last president to publicly call for lower interest rates was George H.W. Bush.</span> He blamed Alan Greenspan’s decision not to keep rates lower after the 1990-1991 recession for contributing to his election defeat <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992.</span>
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">White House attacks on the Fed could take on more significance if they’re echoed by congressional lawmakers because the Fed ultimately answers to Capitol Hill.</span> That hasn’t occurred since Mr. Trump took office.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">“I am generally impressed with Chairman Powell’s leadership,” said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in an interview Tuesday.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">He said the Fed’s current interest-rate “trajectory seems to be headed in a good direction.”
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said he views tariffs, which have been a centerpiece of his “America First” economic and trade agenda in his first two years in office, as a negotiating tactic and vastly understated the size of the tariff regime put in place by his administration.
</span>“We don’t even have tariffs. I’m using tariffs to negotiate,” the president said, describing the tariffs on steel and aluminum he imposed this year as “small.”
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.S. this year imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, washers and solar panels, as well as tariffs on an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $250 billion</span> of Chinese imports.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Some businesses have supported the tariffs, but many have said they hurt their profits and could lead to higher prices for customers.
</span>“Where do we have tariffs? <span id=""30"" class=""red"">We don’t have tariffs anywhere,” Mr. Trump said when asked about the risks tariffs pose to the economy.</span> “You know what happens? <span id=""31"" class=""red"">A business that’s doing badly always likes to blame Trump and the tariffs, because it’s a good excuse for some incompetent guy that’s <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">making $25 million</span> a year.”
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">He said the threat of tariffs had helped his administration renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as begin talks for a trade deal with the European Union.</span> “I could never have done it without tariffs,” he said of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised Nafta deal that the three nations reached earlier this month, but which requires approval from Congress.
“I’m talking tariffs, I’ll use tariffs,” he said. “I mean it.”
On Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump said the lawyer who served him for more than a decade was “like a public relations person” who “represented me on very small things.”
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including campaign-finance violations and said Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange payments to two women during the campaign, implicating the president in a federal crime.
</span>Mr. Trump said he was “surprised” when he learned that Mr. Cohen had taped a conversation they had, which was aired by CNN in July. Mr. Trump said the tape of the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2016 conversation</span>—in which he and Mr. Cohen discussed buying the rights to a former Playboy model’s story of having sex with Mr. Trump—was “meaningless.” They ultimately didn’t go through with the purchase.
“It’s unthinkable that a lawyer would tape a client, that a lawyer would make statements,” Mr. Trump said. “He shouldn’t do that. I’m surprised that he did it.”
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump also sought to distance himself from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, which has broadened to examine business dealings by the Trump Organization, according to people familiar with the matter.</span> “Nothing to do with me,” the president said.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">“This was having to do with the taxi industry or something, and financing,” Mr. Trump said.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to evading taxes on income from his taxi-medallion business and other areas.
</span>Mr. Trump added that other tapes Mr. Cohen kept of his conversations—which were seized by prosecutors in an April raid of the former Trump lawyer’s properties—were “unbelievably complimentary to me.”

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico—Rafael Guzmán and Leinaí Romero spent more than four months without power after Hurricane Maria struck last September, relying on a generator to run a refrigerator, two fans and cellphone chargers. When the married couple learned in April they were having a baby, they made a pledge: “We aren’t going through that again.”

They <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">installed 16 solar</span> panels on the roof of their home in Caguas, south of San Juan, and a battery that charges during the day and allows them to run appliances and a TV at night, said Mr. Guzmán, a 29-year-old accountant.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">With a financing plan to cover <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $21,000 price</span> tag, their monthly payment <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $220 is</span> about the same as their average electric bill before the switch.

</span>Residents and businesses in Puerto Rico increasingly are investing in renewable-energy technologies, mainly solar, to guard against power outages from the island’s still-rickety electric grid. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Solar panel and battery makers like Tesla Inc., Sunrun Inc. and Sonnen are pushing into the market.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">As Puerto Rico seeks to wean itself off imported fuels to generate power, it is emerging as a proving ground for renewable energy.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">There has been “exponential growth for the solar and storage industries in Puerto Rico,” said Adam Gentner, Sonnen’s director of business development and Latin American expansion.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The renewable-energy push comes as the U.S. territory’s debt-ridden public power utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, grapples with its future.</span> Last year’s hurricanes devastated the system. All of Prepa’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1.6 million</span> customers lost power after Hurricane Maria, and only last month did the utility announce it had restored power to all of Puerto Rico.

Even before that, the island’s electric grid was vulnerable to disruptions. Its power plants are <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 30 years</span> older than the U.S. average and prone to outages at a rate <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 12 times</span> the national average, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Puerto Rico depends on imported fuels, mainly petroleum, which alone accounted for nearly half of its electricity production in the fiscal year ended <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017,</span> with natural gas and coal accounting for most of the remainder, according to the EIA.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 2% of</span> the island’s power came from renewable resources, including solar and wind.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Political and business leaders say the island must boost the role of renewable energy, in part to increase the system’s reliability.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In July, Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co., an economic development agency, put out a request for proposals for some of its industrial sites that house large companies like Honeywell International Inc. and Baxter International Inc.</span> It aims to equip the facilities with microgrids—local power systems that can disconnect from the main grid and function autonomously—that include renewable sources.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Homeowners and small- and medium-size businesses are setting up solar systems to supply backup power in the event of an outage.</span> and reduce dependence on the grid. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Since Maria, demand for batteries—which allow customers to store solar-generated power—has soared, said Alejandro Uriarte, chief executive of New Energy Consultants & Contractors LLC, a solar installation company in San Juan.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“We have not sold a single system without batteries after the hurricane,” said Mr. Uriarte, who projects his company will <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach $20 million</span> in sales this year, up <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $11 million</span> last year.</span> Customers include pharmaceutical companies, schools and residences.

F&R Construction Group Inc., a builder in San Juan, had invested <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $150,000 three</span> years ago to install <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 220 solar</span> panels at its headquarters. That reduced the company’s electricity bill to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $4,000 a</span> month <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $6,000,</span> said José García, president of Solaora, an F&R subsidiary that installed the system.

“After Maria we saw how vulnerable the system is,” Mr. García said. This year, F&R decided to invest <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20,000 more</span> in a battery set that can power the company’s computer servers overnight in case of a blackout.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Solar companies say business has increased significantly.</span> Tesla <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 662 projects</span> on the island as of April, including one at a water-pumping station on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. Since the storm, Sonnen has installed three megawatt hours of battery storage in Puerto Rico, compared with about half a megawatt-hour it had set up before.

Sunrun, one of largest residential solar and storage companies in the U.S., initially teamed up with nonprofit organizations after Maria to outfit fire stations in Puerto Rico with solar systems and batteries. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">In June, the company began selling its Brightbox home solar and battery service on the island, and says it has trained <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70 locals</span> for sales, operations and installation positions to help Sunrun meet what it says is strong demand for its products.

</span>Puerto Ricans have “put themselves at the leading edge of the energy transition nationwide,” said Chris Rauscher, Sunrun’s director of public policy.

The Centro de Salud Familiar, a health clinic in Arroyo, on the southern coast, struggled after Maria to keep its emergency room running on a generator. Now, the nonprofit Direct Relief is funding <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $690,000 solar</span> and battery system that will help power the clinic’s EKG machines, X-ray equipment and refrigerators for medicines.

“It gives us mental peace,” said Rosa Rodríguez, the clinic’s executive director.
