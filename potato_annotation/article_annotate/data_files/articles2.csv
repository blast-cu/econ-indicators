39418,"<h3>King Abdullah, a Shrewd Force Who Reshaped Saudi Arabia, Dies at 90</h3>King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who came to the throne in old age and earned a reputation as a cautious reformer even as the Arab Spring revolts toppled heads of state and Islamic State militants threatened the Muslim establishment that he represented, died on Friday, according to a statement on state television. He <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 90.</span>
The Royal Court said in a statement broadcast across the kingdom that the king had died early Friday. The royal court did not disclose the exact cause of death. An announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said the king had a lung infection when he was admitted on Dec.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 to</span> a Riyadh hospital.
The king’s death adds yet another element of uncertainty in a region already overwhelmed by crises and as Saudi Arabia is itself in a struggle with Iran for regional dominance.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The royal family moved quickly to assure a smooth transition of power in a nation that is a close ally of the United States, the world’s largest exporter of oil and the religious center of the Islamic faith.</span> In a televised statement, a brother of Abdullah, Crown Prince Salman, announced that the king had died and that he had assumed the throne.
Salman’s ascension appears to signal that the kingdom will preserve its current policies, but he faces exceptional new challenges. Though Saudi Arabia has traditionally preferred to push its agenda through checkbook diplomacy, it has taken a far more muscular approach since the Arab Spring, offering generous support to its allies, like Egypt, while working to oppose adversaries like President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Even as the drop in the price of oil has depleted its own treasury, it has steadfastly refused to cut the supply, hoping to increase market share at the expense of adversaries that are less able to pump oil at low prices.
</span>“As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah’s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship,” President Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. “As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.”
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he was to lead the American delegation “to pay our respects and offer condolences.”
Accidents of birth and geology made Abdullah one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful men. In control of a fifth of the world’s known petroleum reserves, he traveled to medical appointments abroad in a fleet of jumbo jets, and the changes he wrought in Saudi society were fueled by gushers of oil money.
As king he also bore the title of custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, making him one of the faith’s most important figures.
Abdullah had grown accustomed to the levers of power long before his ascension to the throne in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span></span> After his predecessor, King Fahd, a half brother, had a stroke in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 1995,</span> Abdullah, then the crown prince, ruled in the king’s name.
Yet Abdullah spoke as plainly as the Bedouin tribesmen with whom he had been sent to live in his youth. He refused to be called “your majesty” and discouraged commoners from kissing his hand. He shocked <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 7,000 or</span> so Saudi princes and princesses by cutting their allowances. He was described as ascetic, or as ascetic as someone in the habit of renting out entire hotels could be.
Abdullah’s reign was a constant effort to balance desert traditions with the demands of the modern world, making him appear at times to be shifting from one to the other.
When popular movements and insurgencies overthrew or threatened long-established Arab rulers from Tunisia to Yemen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> he reacted swiftly.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">On his return from three months of treatment for a herniated disk and a blood clot in New York and Morocco, his government <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $130 billion</span> to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">build 500,000 units</span> of low-income housing, to bolster the salaries of government employees and to ensure the loyalty of religious organizations.
</span>He also created a Facebook page, where citizens were invited to present their grievances directly to him, although it was not known how many entries actually reached him.
But in at least two telephone calls he castigated President Obama for encouraging democracy in the Middle East, saying it was dangerous. And he showed no tolerance for the sort of dissent unfolding elsewhere.
The grand mufti, the kingdom’s highest religious official, proclaimed that Islam forbade street protests. Scores of protesters who failed to heed that message were arrested in the chiefly Shiite eastern provinces. A new law imposed crippling fines for offenses, like threatening national security, that could be broadly interpreted. Reaching beyond his borders, Abdullah sent tanks to help quell an uprising in neighboring Bahrain.
Moves of Moderation
Still, Abdullah became, in some ways, a force of moderation. He contested Al Qaeda’s militant interpretations of the faith as justifying, even compelling, terrorist acts. He ordered that textbooks be purged of their most extreme language and <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sent 900 imams</span> to re-education sessions. He had hundreds of militants arrested and some beheaded.
But he was also mindful that his family had, since the 18th century, derived its authority from an alliance with the strict Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam. He accordingly made only modest changes to the kingdom’s conservative clerical establishment. When Islamic State forces conquered vast stretches of Syria and Iraq, imposing a creed linked to Saudi Arabia’s own, the kingdom was slow to respond.
However, Abdullah chastised senior clerics for not speaking out more forcibly against the jihadists, and he eventually sent Saudi pilots to participate in an American-led campaign against the Islamic State.
Abdullah’s Saudi Arabia had hurtled from tribal pastoralism to advanced capitalism in little more than a generation. The fundamentalist clerics who gave the family legitimacy remained a powerful force. Women who appeared in public without the required covering risked arrest or a beating from the religious police.
Abdullah did make changes that were seen as important in the Saudi context. He allowed women to work as supermarket cashiers and appointed a woman as a deputy minister. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $12.5 billion</span> research university he built and named for himself, women study beside men.
However, he did not fulfill a promise made to Barbara Walters of ABC News in his first televised interview as king in October 2005: that he would allow women to drive, a hugely contentious issue in Saudi Arabia.
Although he ordered the kingdom’s first elections for municipal councils <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> a promised second election, in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2009,</span> in which women would vote, was postponed until <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2011.</span> Then in March of that year, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs announced that the question of women voting would be put off indefinitely “because of the kingdom’s social customs.”
Abdullah’s greatest legacy, however, may prove to be a scholarship program that sent tens of thousands of young Saudi men and women abroad to study at Western universities and colleges. It has been suggested that the changes long resisted by conservative forces — resistance that even a king could not overcome — would one day come about as those men and women rose in the government, industry and academia.
Perhaps Abdullah’s most daunting challenge arrived in the wake of the Sept.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks, with the revelation <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 15 of</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 19 hijackers</span> were Saudis. The royal family at first railed at what it called a vicious smear campaign against the kingdom, then ruthlessly suppressed known militants — not least because the monarchy itself was a main target of Al Qaeda.
Striking a balance was almost always Abdullah’s preference. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He strove to keep oil prices high, but not so high that they prompted consumers to abandon petroleum, then hedged his bets by investing billions in solar energy research.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> he convened a meeting of world religious leaders to promote tolerance, but held it in Madrid rather than Saudi Arabia, where the public practice of religions other than Islam is outlawed.
Yet Abdullah could, and did, take strong positions. He denounced the American-led invasion of Iraq as “an illegal occupation”; proposed a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East that included recognition of Israel by Arab nations; and urged in a secret cable that the United States attack Iran, Saudi Arabia’s great rival. “Cut off the head off the snake,” he said.
His kingdom’s interests always came first. Although American companies discovered and developed the Saudi oil fields, he cut deals with Russian, Chinese and European petroleum companies. He made it clear that the world’s energy appetites mattered less than Saudi Arabia’s future.
A Rigorous Upbringing
Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud was born in Riyadh <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1924 into</span> a vast, complicated family. His father, Abdul Aziz, had as many <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 22 wives</span>.
Abdul Aziz, whose ancestors founded a precursor to the present Saudi state <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1744,</span> chose his wives partly to secure alliances with other Arabian tribes. Abdullah’s mother, Fahda bint Asi al-Shuraim, was a daughter of the chief of the Shammar, whose influence extended into Syria, Iraq and Jordan.
Abdullah was Fahda’s only son. She also had two daughters.
King Abdul Aziz was not an indulgent father to his dozens of sons. He was quoted as saying, “I train my own children to walk barefoot, to rise two hours before dawn, to eat but little, to ride horses bareback.”
When the young Abdullah once neglected to offer his seat to a guest, Abdul Aziz sentenced him to three days in prison.
Abdullah, who overcame a stutter, was educated in religion, Arab literature and science by Islamic scholars at the royal court. From the Bedouin nomads, he learned traditional ways, including horsemanship and desert warfare. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1962,</span> he was appointed commander of the National Guard, which draws recruits from the Bedouin tribes, protects the king and acts as a counterweight to the army.
Four of Abdullah’s half brothers preceded him to the throne.
King Khalid appointed Abdullah as second deputy prime minister <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1975.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1982,</span> Fahd, Khalid’s successor, named him deputy prime minister and crown prince.
After Fahd’s stroke, Abdullah ran the government at first as regent. Political pressures later forced the removal of the regent title, but Abdullah remained the effective decision maker. He refused to sign any official papers with his own name as long as his stricken brother lived. Fahd died on Aug.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span>
One of King Abdullah’s first official acts was to pardon two Libyans accused of plotting to kill him, a result of Egypt’s engineering a reconciliation between the two nations. He also pardoned three Saudi academics who were in prison for advocating a constitutional monarchy.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">He went on to establish job-training programs to help ease severe unemployment among educated young Saudis, to develop long-wasted natural gas as a commodity that could be exported, and to bring Saudi Arabia into the World Trade Organization.</span> He became the first Saudi head of state to meet a pope, Benedict XVI, <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007.</span>
Although he reaffirmed his kingdom’s longstanding alliance with the United States, tensions arose with events. Abdullah refused, for instance, to permit American bases on Saudi territory for the Iraq invasion <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> something he had allowed in the first Gulf War.
‘For the Greater Good’
The king also grappled with domestic crises. The deaths <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 girls</span> in a dormitory fire in Mecca <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002 caused</span> an international uproar when it was learned that the religious police had not let them escape because they were not properly dressed. Furious, the king dismissed the head of women’s education.
<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2007,</span> he pardoned a teenage girl who had been sentenced to six months in jail <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 100 lashes</span> after being raped. She was convicted of being found in a car alone with a man who was not her relative, a crime in Saudi law.
Though Abdullah made it clear that he thought the girl was guilty, pleasing the religious authorities, he pardoned her, he said, “for the greater good.”
In line with Islamic law, Abdullah kept no more than four wives at once, and was married at <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 13 times</span>, said Joseph Kechichian, who studies the royal family as a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.
Abdullah fathered at least seven sons, nearly all of whom have occupied powerful positions as provincial governors and officers in the national guard, Dr. Kechichian said. Of <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 15 known</span> daughters, one is a prominent physician, and another has appeared on television to advocate women’s rights.
Abdullah may have resembled his warrior father, but he had a modern sensibility. A diplomatic cable revealed by WikiLeaks <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 said</span> that he had suggested to an American counterterrorism official that electronic chips be implanted in detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
He said it had worked with horses and falcons, to which the American replied, “Horses don’t have good lawyers.”

Rather than publishing one story this week, we decided to try to capture a bigger picture by featuring numerous voices.

I learned that space and time away from my husband and children is good for everyone, especially me. My husband has started saying “woo!” to everything in quarantine, and it makes me want to scream. My children are amazing and empathetic and annoying. I have to lock the bathroom or they climb into the shower with me or stand next to me while I’m on the toilet. Small breaks: riding the Peloton with headphones on, taking a bath, solo walks, drives to Starbucks and Target runs.

I never fought with my grandparents, but three months of quarantine can change any relationship. Arguments with my grandmother started over my dog’s ban from the kitchen, then moved to the mistakes I’m making in my love life and on to the length of my summer dresses.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Lately we’ve been arguing about the approach to the Black Lives Matter protests: My grandmother’s experience as a Black woman in America, born in rural South Carolina to sharecropping parents, is extremely different from my own, as a Duke University-educated and Microsoft-employed Black woman.</span> I am her wildest dream.
We debate how Black Americans protest police brutality and systemic racism. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She wants me to stay home, away from the tear gas and rubber bullets, and not speak so candidly to my white colleagues, for fear that I’ll lose my corporate job.</span> I believe the consequences of a peaceful protest don’t outweigh the necessity to make my voice heard.
I moved in with my grandparents after a long-term relationship with my middle school sweetheart ended abruptly in March. I’ve tried online dating — my grandmother swipes on my behalf. I went on a social-distanced date and my grandmother critiqued every outfit.
My grandparents have a 57-year marriage. I thought they had marriage figured out and could teach me, but they don’t. They argue and act childish like most couples. I guess I’m on my own with this marriage thing.
They would probably say living with me for the past three months is the best Covid-19 gift. I not only grocery shop but also introduced them to streaming church on YouTube. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They don’t understand “working from home” and therefore think I’m unemployed.</span> They’re sad to see me go.

I was sick for two weeks in April, though I didn’t get tested for the coronavirus. I learned that I could rely on my husband — briefly. It took two weeks for him to go from very willing to pitch in to noticeably irritated that I wasn’t <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">feeling 100 percent</span> yet.
There was a dark period during my illness where I wished I was back in my parents’ New England home, with no neighbors around, roaming the woods with my child. I realized that ache will never go away and I don’t know what to do about it.
Having a baby in a society that already put much of the child care on the shoulders of the mother, working or not, did in most of our romance long ago. I have also started to feel twinges of anxiety about my decision not to go back to work. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">I don’t regret the choice to stay home with my baby, but job hunting looks even more bleak post-quarantine.

My husband and I rented a 20-foot <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">yurt 11 years</span> ago because we knew it would either teach us to be good communicators or reveal that we were better suited to monkhood. We thought if our marriage could survive sharing such a small space, it could survive anything.
Since social isolation began, we wanted a creative way to deal with conflicts. So we’ve been collaborating on “Broadway in the Yurt” — classic show tunes with a twist. The song “Mood-Altering Foods” — a twist on “Food Glorious Food” from the musical “Oliver” — was born out of my penchant for comfort foods when stressed and Tom feeling that maybe it wasn’t the healthiest way of dealing with things.
We’ve learned that the only thing more conducive to growth than living in a yurt is living in a yurt during quarantine.

My boyfriend and I are accidentally living on an island in Indonesia; we were supposed to be here for just three days when lockdown happened. The island is mostly deserted — virtually all tourists have left, so we are alone all the time.
Eduardo and I had been having a nonexclusive, long-distance relationship for two years and decided to travel around Southeast Asia. When coronavirus exploded, we decided not to go back to our countries (the United States for him, Brazil for me) so we could stay together.
Since lockdown, we’ve had some very intense conversations, sorting out a lot of our past. Issues of jealousy that were never part of our history suddenly became inescapable. We thought about breaking up. But with no boats out of the island and no flights out of Indonesia, leaving was not an option. Now, almost three months later, we’re crazy serious about each other.

Before Covid-19, my brother and I had a bare-bones relationship. With a 10-year age difference, there’s not much we can talk about. But after seeing his addiction to video games since I’ve been home, I’ve entered into the uncharted waters of violently arguing with him about his life’s priorities and then tearfully making up.
In just two months, we’ve shared more tears and hugs than the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 10 years</span> combined. It’s been a time of many firsts — the first time I had a deep conversation with him, the first time I told him a secret and the first time I told him I love him.
After this pandemic subsides, I want to remain actively involved in my brother’s life. I now feel responsible for his well-being, as much as I imagine a parent cares for their child. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Maybe I won’t take a job on the west coast after graduation; maybe I’ll stay on the East Coast to be close.

Before entering this quarantine, my husband and I suffered a miscarriage. I had a dilation and curettage procedure a week before New York City shut down. We had to adjust quickly to our new reality: staying home, losing a pregnancy and my husband getting laid off. I had a hard time sleeping. I’d wake up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 a</span>.m. on the couch. My husband would find me in the morning and we’d just sit there, holding each other.
My husband is resilient. I would snap at him for being positive about the future or hopeful that we will get pregnant again, feeling like it was too soon. I realized that’s just him, though. Positivity is how he grieves.
The last couple of months have allowed us time to grieve in a way we normally wouldn’t have. I was scheduled to return to work a few days after the procedure.
We started having conversations with our families and friends, opening up about what had happened. People told us stories of their own losses and their friends’ losses. Even though we were stuck at home, we felt love and support from the outside world. Randy and I have come a long way during this time — now, we accept our loss as part of our story.

We went from seeing each other on weekends at goth and rock clubs — and enjoying maybe one lazy day after — to this. We actually haven’t fought much. So many L.A. relationships are superficial, and I sometimes feared ours was too. But it’s not. Our proximity has proved to me than our relationship is more than sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.
Overall, we communicate more deeply than we did before this pandemic. The best part has been learning more about each other’s true nature. When I’m feeling down, I don’t need to speak or explain. Tony reaches his arms out to hold me and suggests we take a drive to see the ocean.
Our one-year anniversary is today, but we’ve chosen to take a week apart for personal space. It feels healthy and right, because my apartment is so small.

Because we have so much more time together, we indulge in sex almost daily, and the fact that he can and that I want to has amazed me. Even better, he comes out of the study throughout his work day to kiss me, and makes a point of starting his day exercising with me and ending it snuggling. We sing and dance like teenagers.

Before this, we rarely raised our voices and were both quick to apologize. It seems our good communication has broken down. Usually we are both noncombative, but when you have to face a harsh reality every day, it’s hard to ignore or make excuses.
He always said a major reason for the distance in our relationship was that I worked too much. But now that we have all of this time together, it’s been detrimental to our relationship. There have been a few bright spots. I was having a bad day and he knew I had been craving a McFlurry, so he went out and got one for me with extra M&Ms. It reminds me to keep the compassion alive.
But when our lease is up, we will not be living together anymore, and I will be moving across the country. This time has been revealing not only for my relationship but for the whole structure and meaning of my life.

Living with her 2½-year-old daughter.
I’m a single mom. My daughter splits half her time with her father, but the hardest day was when I allowed her to watch television for five hours so I could work, but I really just sat on the floor staring, unable to do anything.
I’m a professor at a university, and it was difficult just ending the semester, without support or day care. Things got really tough. But I found that when I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going.

‘The perfect time to create something new’
Ariana Shapiro,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 26
New</span> Haven, Conn.
Living with her boyfriend, who will join her lease in June.
I get lost on endless Zoom calls. Some days I hear a sharp knock on the door of my home office and look up to see my boyfriend mooning me, his cheeks pressed tight against the glass door, just out of sight of the camera. It lifts my spirits.
In March we started collecting food from our neighbors and distributing it to families in need. We weren’t ready to move in before, but we are now. We started a mutual aid network together and we talk about what’s next: A worker’s cooperative? A political campaign? A nonprofit? We realized that this is the perfect time to create something new.

Apple struck back on Monday in the keynote speech of its Worldwide Developers Conference. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">It unveiled Apple Music, which combines a subscription-based, on-demand streaming-music service, a 24-hour global Internet radio station, and a service for artists to connect with listeners.

</span>It also introduced an app called News, which will be included in a forthcoming update to its iOS mobile software that launches this fall. News combines articles from news organizations including ESPN, the New York Times and Condé Nast, presenting them in a single format in the style of a digital magazine.

Apple has at least one other content service in the works—a streaming TV service that wasn’t announced on Monday, but could arrive before the end of the year.

“It’s interesting to see Apple trying to retake control of content,” said technology analyst Jan Dawson, who runs Jackdaw Research. “It feels like Apple has been in limbo, adrift in the last few years. Music went to streaming. Video went to subscriptions and Apple sat back and watched that happen.”

Together, the initiatives highlight Apple’s role at the intersection of media and technology. Once a pioneer, Apple now risked falling behind, as with music. Shares of Apple <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slipped 85 cents</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $127.80 on</span> Monday, but have <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 16% this</span> year.

Apple is moving to reassert itself amid changes in how consumers watch television, read news and listen to music, while seeking to leverage its hundreds of millions of iTunes accounts and hundreds of millions of smartphones and tablets in consumers’ hands.

“There is this idea of appealing to a new generation with music,” said Horace Dediu, founder of research firm Asymco. “And this generation doesn’t buy music, they stream it.”

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Apple said its streaming-music subscription service will <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $9.99 a</span> month after a three-month trial period, similar to Spotify’s ad-free tier.</span> Families will be able to share a single account for up to six members <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $14.99 a</span> month.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president who oversees Internet services and software, said it reached an agreement with the three major music labels before the announcement.

In a second music move, Apple said it plans to launch a live radio station, <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Beats 1.</span> It will <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">broadcast 24 hours</span> a day with DJs in Los Angeles, New York and London, and be available in more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 countries</span>. Apple will also offer genre-specific stations, ranging from indie rock to classical, created by other DJs.

“The vast majority of people in the world don’t subscribe to music, so we think there is a real opportunity,” said Mr. Cue in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “We’re trying to do something that’s bigger than streaming, that’s bigger than radio.”

Apple said its Music service, which will be available on Apple devices <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> will be offered on devices running Google Inc.’s Android operating system later this year.

With News, Apple aims to give users a single spot to find news from a variety of publishers instead of sifting through individual apps.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Cue said Apple aims to help news organizations—many which are financially strapped—to publish articles in appealing layouts that work well for mobile devices.

</span>The Apple initiative comes on the heels of Facebook Inc.’s launch last month of a news partnership called Instant Articles in which publishers ranging from NBC News to National Geographic post their stories directly in Facebook’s newsfeed, rather than linking readers back to their own sites.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Apple said its arrangement will allow publishers to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">keep 100% of</span> the revenue from ads they sell themselves <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 70% of</span> ad revenue generated by Apple’s iAd platform.

</span>Apple also introduced a feature called proactive assistant in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">iOS 9,</span> the next version of its mobile-operating system aimed at making its devices smarter. Apple said the feature will suggest apps to launch or people to contact based on past usage. In addition, it will learn things over time such as a user’s music preferences.

The feature is somewhat similar to Google Now, which aims to give users relevant information at the moment it is most useful. Apple sought to distinguish its service from Google by saying the information will be processed on the user’s device, won’t be shared with advertisers and isn’t linked to other Apple services.

Beyond media, Apple also used the two-hour-plus keynote presentation to announce expansions of its Apple Pay mobile-payments service and enhancements for its newest device, the Apple Watch.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company said it is expanding Apple Pay to accept cards from Discover Financial Services Inc., as well as branded cards from certain retail stores.</span> Early participants among stores include department-store chains Kohl’s Corp. and J.C. Penney Co., and warehouse club BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The company also said it is extending Apple Pay next month to the U.K., where it will be accepted at more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 250,000 locations</span>, including the London transportation system.

For Apple Watch, the company announced a major software update—less than two months after the first Watches went on sale. The biggest change is the ability for apps to run natively on the Watch. Until now, Watch apps have had to run on an iPhone, which slowed performance of some apps.

25786,"<h3>China’s credibility on the line as yuan slides again, global markets slump</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">BEIJING — China’s currency slid for a second day on Wednesday, sending more shockwaves through global financial markets and raising fresh questions about the credibility of the country’s economic management.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The surprise moves by China to allow more market forces to set currency rates — an effective devaluation at the moment — have also deepened speculation about the true strength of the world’s second-largest economy after recent jolts including a stock market plunge.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The sense that the Communist Party was an almost infallible steward of the nation’s economy took a battering during the stock crash in June and July.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A few weeks later, China’s economic data — showing growth steady <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 7 percent</span> despite widespread signs of a slowdown — were widely derided by analysts as inaccurate and overblown.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Now, fresh concerns have surfaced about the stewardship of the central bank after a shock decision to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting exchange rates.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Over two days, China’s currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 3.5 percent</span>, sparking headlines about a global currency war and threatening to fan trade tensions with the United States.
</span>[China devaluation of yuan prompts U.S. outcry]
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The currency shake-up has spilled far beyond China to drag down world financial markets.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones industrial average was <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 1.3 percent</span> at midday Wednesday — after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shedding 1.2 percent</span> on Tuesday — but it recovered in the afternoon, erasing its losses and edging into positive territory.</span> European exchanges took a beating for a second day, led by <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.4 percent</span> drop in France’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CAC 40 and</span> a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3.3 percent</span> fall in Germany’s DAX.
China’s central bank set a central rate for the yuan on Wednesday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.3306 to</span> the dollar, slightly below the previous day’s closing rate. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The yuan then slid further during onshore trading to close <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.3870 to</span> the dollar.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">On Tuesday, the bank said it would adjust the mechanism by which it sets the yuan’s central rate to give the market a greater role.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The yuan can then <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">trade 2 percent</span> higher or lower than that central rate.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">While experts said some of the criticism could be wide of the mark, the People’s Bank of China may now have a tough job on its hands to prevent the currency's decline from spiraling.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">[China’s remedy to slowing economy: cheaper currency]
“The central bank’s credibility will be put to the test,” said Andrew Polk, resident economist at the Conference Board China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">“After the recent flubbing of the stock market fall, this is arguably a somewhat dangerous course of action.”
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">China’s decision to free up its exchange rate appeared to come in response to repeated urging from the International Monetary Fund — as well as from the United States.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It appeared designed, experts said, to bolster the case for the yuan’s acceptance as a global reserve currency, and specifically its inclusion in the Special Drawing Rights basket alongside the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">But the move was also probably timed to support the nation’s slowing economy and critical export sector.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Many economists agree the currency had become overvalued, and efforts to keep it stable had kept domestic interest rates higher and monetary policy tighter than economic conditions warranted.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">[What the Chinese devaluation means for the world economy]
The yuan hit a four-year low on Wednesday, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaching 6.45 to</span> the dollar within China and as low <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 6.59 in</span> international trade.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Ironically, Japan and the euro zone have overseen much sharper depreciations in the yen and euro, respectively, this year as part of efforts to stimulate their economies, but they have escaped without the volley of criticism from U.S. politicians that greeted China's decision Tuesday.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">In China, senior Commerce Ministry official Zhang Yuzhong was reported as saying on Wednesday that the currency’s decline would help exports — a backbone of the Chinese economy.
</span>Reuters news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying there was “growing clamor within government circles” to allow further depreciation in coming months for that reason.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">But trying to manage a steady decline in a currency can be a dangerous game, said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG in Melbourne, explaining that expectations of depreciation will only encourage more capital outflows.
</span>“If they get this wrong, it can go bad,” he said. “They need to plant a seed — that speculators are not going to get their own way, that at some stage there is going to be stability, and that ‘we will be there.’”

While investor George Soros was famously said to have “broken” the Bank of England <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992 by</span> speculating against the pound and forcing sterling out of Europe’s Exchange Rate Mechanism, the People’s Bank of China is unlikely to face anything like those pressures and has a much stronger hand in the form <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $3.</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 65 trillion</span> in foreign exchange reserves.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Still, the bank will have to keep its “fingers crossed,” said Chen Long, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, who sketched out three scenarios.
</span>The worst scenario is that the yuan continues to slide, perhaps <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">toward 7 to</span> the dollar. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">That would put enormous downward pressure on other Asian currencies, raise a further firestorm of criticism in the United States about efforts to steal American jobs, and give substance to those alarmist “currency war” headlines about nations engaging in competitive devaluations to boost their economies.
</span>The central bank also could do a U-turn and give up on the idea of letting markets determine the exchange rate, which would also damage its credibility.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Or the currency could stabilize in a day or two, Chen said.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Foreign exchange traders told wire services that state-owned banks began selling dollars on Wednesday on behalf of the People’s Bank of China to help stem the currency’s slide.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">“Looking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan,” the central bank said.
</span>But markets have a habit of overshooting. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">China’s stock market has lost around a quarter of its value since a mid-June peak after <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 150 percent</span> in the previous year.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">In an effort to stabilize that market, the authorities damaged their own standing by taking extreme measures, banning major shareholders from selling shares and launching criminal investigations into “malicious” short-sellers.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Arthur Kroeber, managing director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said this week’s move to a market-driven exchange rate would be good for China and the world in the long term, supporting the government’s efforts to reform its economy and its intention to give markets a “decisive role” in allocating resources.
</span>But the timing is problematic, he wrote in a note on Wednesday.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">“The currency is being let off the leash right at the moment when market sentiment on China is pessimistic because of a continuing economic slowdown, an increase in private capital outflows, and entrenched producer price deflation,” he wrote.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">“Market confidence was also shaken by the authorities’ clumsy intervention to prop up the stock market after the popping of the equity bubble in June.”
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“In this context it is no surprise that many traders and analysts have interpreted the currency move — wrongly, in our view — as a last throw of the dice by a government panicking about an economy in free-fall.”</span>"

May</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017

WASHINGTON</span>—President Donald Trump’s tough talk on Mexico might have had an unintended effect: Fear of a trade war pushed down the value of the Mexican peso, increased the U.S.’s appetite for subsequently cheaper Mexican goods and widened the U.S. trade deficit with its southern neighbor, the opposite of Mr. Trump’s objectives.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The U.S. posted <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $7 billion</span> trade deficit in goods with Mexico in March, the highest since <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2007,</span> the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $28.1 billion</span> in Mexican products shipped across the border—including cars, avocados and other items—marked a high.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The trade deficit with Mexico <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leapt 14% in</span> the first quarter this year compared with the first quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016.</span></span> That is due at least in part to a decline in the peso. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The currency is down <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6% against</span> the dollar over the past year and more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% since</span> Mr. Trump’s November election win, even after a rebound in recent months.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump pledged during his campaign to make Mexico pay for a border wall, and he has repeatedly threatened to revamp or even cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement as part of broader plans to reinvigorate U.S. factories.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1994 pact</span></span> among the U.S., Mexico and Canada lowered tariffs and other barriers on a host of goods.

<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1994 pact</span></span> among the U.S., Mexico and Canada lowered tariffs and other barriers on a host of goods.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Revamping the treaty could ultimately hurt Mexican exports, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 80% of</span> which go to the U.S.

</span>But in the near term, the peso’s drop has made it less expensive for American firms to buy Mexican goods in dollars.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The strong dollar, meanwhile, has curbed demand for U.S. exports, said Eduardo González, an economist at Citibanamex in Mexico City.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Trump administration called the widening of the trade gap with Mexico alarming.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The United States can no longer sustain this inflated trade deficit with our closest trading partners,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The Trump administration is committed to rebalancing our trade relationships in order to protect American workers and businesses from lopsided trade relationships,” Mr. Ross added.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The rise in the deficit could be temporary.</span> The peso has rebounded in recent months, and Mr. Trump recently backed off a threat to pull out of Nafta, indicating that the administration would seek mostly modest changes to the agreement in talks with Mexico and Canada.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trading partner in goods, and the factories of the two nations are closely intertwined.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Among the biggest buyers of Mexican goods in the U.S. are manufacturers importing parts for their products.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Likewise, parts exported from the U.S. make up <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40% of</span> the value of Mexico’s manufactured exports.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">In this way, improving health of U.S. factories, who are benefiting from steady demand domestically and abroad, is another factor likely driving up the deficit with Mexico.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The top Mexican exports to the U.S. are cars, machinery and medical equipment, according to the U.S. trade representative.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">In Mexico, manufactured exports, which make <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 90% of</span> the country’s total exports, were <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 9.2% in</span> the first quarter from the year-earlier period <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $83.6 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">More than a third of the exports were autos and auto parts, although exports of processed food and electronics goods have also seen strong growth.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Overall, the U.S. trade gap with other countries has widened this year compared with a year earlier, in a sign of a steadier global economy.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expanded 7.5% in</span> the first quarter compared with the same period <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 as</span> exports and imports each climbed <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7%,</span> the Commerce Department said.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">With the world grappling with rising prices, a tour through Argentina reveals that years of inflation can give rise to a truly bizarre economy.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Supported by
Jack Nicas and
Jack Nicas and Ana Lankes, correspondents in South America, spent two weeks traveling around Buenos Aires to understand how Argentines have adapted to years of high inflation.
</span>BUENOS AIRES — Eduardo Rabuffetti is an Argentine who has been to the United States once, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 1999 honeymoon</span> in Miami. Yet he probably knows <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 bill</span> better than most Americans.
He says he can pick out a counterfeit by touch. He can tell you exactly <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what $100,000 looks</span> like. (Ten half-inch stacks, small enough to hold in one hand.) And on numerous occasions, he has walked down the streets of Buenos Aires with tens of thousands of U.S. dollars tucked into his jacket.
That is because Mr. Rabuffetti, a property developer who has built two office towers and a house here, bought the land for each of those buildings <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $100 bills</span>.
“Here, if you don’t actually see the money, nobody signs anything,” he said. “After the number of crises we’ve been through, let’s just say you get used to it.”
It is not just Mr. Rabuffetti. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Nearly every big purchase in Argentina — land, houses, cars, expensive art — is done in tall stacks of U.S. currency.</span> To save up, Argentines stuff bundles of American bills into old clothes, beneath floor boards and in bombproof safe deposit boxes past nine locked gates and five stories beneath the ground.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Argentines hold so much U.S. currency — experts believe perhaps more than anywhere outside the United States — sometimes it gets thrown away by mistake.</span> Last month, passers-by found tens of thousands of dollars blowing around at an Argentine dump.
The dollar is king in Argentina because the Argentine peso is disintegrating in value, particularly over the past month. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">One year ago, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 180 pesos</span> could <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy $1 on</span> the widely used black market.</span> Now it <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">takes 298 pesos</span> to buy a buck. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">With the peso plummeting, prices are soaring to keep up.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Many economists expect inflation here, already <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 64 percent</span> this year, to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit 90 percent</span> by December.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">It is one of the country’s worst economic crises in decades, and that is saying something for Argentina.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">As countries across the world try to cope with rising prices, there is perhaps no major economy that understands how to live with inflation better than Argentina.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The country has struggled with rapidly rising prices for much of the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 50 years</span>.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">During a chaotic stretch in the late 1980s, inflation hit a nearly <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">unbelievable 3,000 percent</span> and residents rushed to snatch up groceries before clerks with price guns could make their rounds.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Now high inflation is back, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeding 30 percent</span> every year <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">To understand how Argentines cope, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurateurs, realtors, barbers, taxi drivers, money changers, street performers, street vendors and the unemployed.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The economy is not always the best conversation starter, but in Argentina, it animated just about everyone, eliciting curses, deep sighs and informed opinions about monetary policy.</span> One woman happily showed off her hiding spot for a wad of U.S. dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed cash into her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress wondered whether she had immigrated to the right country.
One thing became strikingly clear: Argentines have developed a highly unusual relationship with their money.
They spend their pesos as quickly as they get them. They buy everything from TVs to potato peelers in installments. They don’t trust banks. They hardly use credit. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">And after years of constant price hikes, they are left with little idea of how much things should cost.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Argentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to fathom almost anywhere else in the world.</span> Life is especially manageable for those with the means to make the upside-down system work. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But all those striking workarounds mean that few who have held political power during years of economic distress have found themselves paying a real price.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">“We ask ourselves the same thing: How is society allowing these things to happen?” said Juan Piantoni, the head of Ingot, a safe-deposit-box company where business is booming as Argentines pay to stash their cash.</span> “At this moment, I think we’re on the eve of a situation that could lead to a major crisis,” he added. “No one has lit the fuse yet. But the day that happens, we’ll see what we’re up against.”
So far, things have remained largely calm. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Wages for many jobs are rising at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 percent</span> a year.</span> Landlords can raise rents at similar rates. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And millions of Argentines use the black market to evade government restrictions on buying U.S. dollars.
</span>The result is that in the wealthier areas of Argentina’s capital, construction continues apace and restaurants and bars are packed. The next dinner reservation for two at Anchoita, one of the city’s hippest restaurants, is in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2023.</span>
In poorer neighborhoods, people collect scrap cardboard to sell, pool their money for food and swap used goods to avoid the peso altogether. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Argentina’s poor typically don’t have jobs with automatic wage increases, and they certainly don’t have extra cash to buy U.S. dollars.</span> That means they are left making few pesos while everything around them gets much, much more expensive. <span id=""22"" class=""red""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 37 percent</span> of Argentines now live in poverty, up <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 30 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">8 Signs That the Economy Is Losing Steam
Worrying outlook.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Amid persistently high inflation, rising consumer prices and declining spending, the American economy is showing clear signs of slowing down, fueling concerns about a potential recession.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Here are other eight measures signaling trouble ahead:
On <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> Argentina’s economic minister resigned.</span> Over the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 26 days</span>, the peso’s value <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 26 percent</span>. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Then President Alberto Fernandez fired the new economic minister.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It was the 21st time that an Argentine economic minister lasted two months or less.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Argentina’s recent bout with hyperinflation is linked to the same things that have driven up prices worldwide, including the war in Ukraine, supply-chain constraints and big increases in public spending.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">But many economists believe Argentina’s inflation is also self-inflicted.</span> In short, the country spends far more than it takes in to fund free or deeply subsidized health care, universities, energy and public transportation. To make up for the shortfall, it prints more pesos.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund, which is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owed $44 billion</span> from Argentina, has asked the government to cut its deficit and pass stricter monetary policies.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the new minister, Sergio Massa, made one of the most significant steps in years when he pledged that Argentina would stop printing pesos to fund its budget.
</span>Yet many Argentines were skeptical that the country was ready to make the tough choices necessary.
“We might need the patient to have a heart attack before the family says, ‘Let’s do the surgery,’” said Hugo Alconada Mon, one of the country’s top investigative journalists and a best-selling author who spent almost the last of his savings recently on car repairs. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">“But how many people will end up in poverty because of that?</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">How many people will leave the country?”
Abandoning price tags
Argentines are hoping the current moment does not spiral into a disaster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 2001,</span> when there was a run on the banks.
</span>That year, it became clear that foreign investors believed the Argentine peso was worth far less than the government’s official rate, and Argentines rushed to get their money before it was lost. Instead, the government halted withdrawals — and then gave them all a haircut, reducing everyone’s savings in a sudden devaluation. The president resigned and left the government offices in a helicopter to avoid the angry crowds in the regal square out front, Plaza de Mayo.
Two decades later, the angry crowds are still in Plaza de Mayo. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Thousands of Argentines gathered there last month to protest the soaring inflation.
</span>Ana Mabel was on the outskirts of the crowd, mixing peanuts and caramelized sugar in a metal vat. She was selling bags of candied peanuts <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 200 pesos</span> each, or <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70 cents</span>; she had <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">charged 150 pesos</span> a week earlier. But that increase hardly kept up with her costs. Everything she needed had gotten pricier in just the past few weeks: the peanuts, the sugar, the oil, the gas tank, and the plastic baggies to package the treat. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">She has five children to support, and for the first time, she had taken on debt.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">“Nothing regulates the prices,” she said, frustrated, slowly turning the peanuts in the vat.</span> “The businessmen don’t want it. The government can’t. And that all falls on us.”
For Argentines, it is an old story. <span id=""37"" class=""red""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> prices had risen so much that Argentina doubled the size of its largest bank note <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1,000 pesos</span>, then worth <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $58 on</span> the black market.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Now that note is worth <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.45 </span>— about the price of a Big Mac.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">An iPhone can now cost more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 million</span> pesos.
</span>Many Argentines have lost their bearings on value. Menus are constantly changed. Taxi meters are frequently adjusted. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">And price tags are often outdated.
</span>Oscar Benitez runs a meticulously organized hardware store the size of a large walk-in closet. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">He <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sells 80,000 different</span> products, and he hardly knows the price of any of them.
</span>That is because they change every few days, updated in a running list sent by his suppliers that he checks on his computer for every sale. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">He has largely abandoned price tags.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">He shows a pair of scissors that the supplier says should now <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost 600 pesos</span>.</span> “A month ago, it was <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 400 pesos</span>,” he said, consulting his list. “A year ago, it was <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 120 pesos</span>.”
He looked exasperated. “It’s sad. But for me, it was always like this,” he said. “If I wasn’<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">t 51 years</span> old, I’d be in the United States, which is what I’m now trying to make happen for my daughters.”
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Prices are fluctuating so much that in recent weeks many companies have halted sales to see where prices settle, making it difficult to find certain items, including cooking oil and car parts.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Some farmers are also holding onto their wheat and soybeans, betting prices will rise — and blunting the economic benefits of a commodity boom that should benefit an exporter like Argentina.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">At a small shop in downtown Buenos Aires, Noelia Mendoza was selling her last stock of toilet paper.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">Her suppliers said they had no more, so she had raised her prices.</span> <span id=""48"" class=""red"">A pack of four single-ply rolls now <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost 290 pesos</span>, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $1,</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from a month earlier.</span> “There is going to be a shortage,” she said.
Her friend standing nearby, Carla Cejas, chimed in: “I never understood the bidet until now.”
A duffel bag full <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10,000 </span></span>$100 bills
Ignacio Jauand, a 34-year-old publicist, buys everything he can in installments, including his bed, his clothes, a <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">PlayStation 5 and</span> a potato peeler.
It’s not that he can’t afford them. It’s that he’s betting the value of the peso will fall. <span id=""49"" class=""red"">If he’s right, his final payments cost significantly less.</span> That bet, he said, has always paid off. <span id=""50"" class=""red"">“The last installment I paid for the TV or the fridge cost two or three McDonald’s combos,” he said.
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">“Buying stuff is how you beat inflation,” he added.
</span>That is the mantra of Argentina. Pesos disintegrate in value, so you better spend them as quickly as you can.
<span id=""52"" class=""red"">People go out to eat or buy appliances, art or cars, while shop owners stock up on inventory, betting prices will only go up.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">“When I think of my savings in pesos, I say, ‘Let’s pay for a trip, let’s renew something in the house, let’s buy stuff,’” said Eduardo Levy Yeyati, an Argentine economist and visiting professor at Harvard University.</span> “Otherwise I feel like I’m losing money every day by keeping it in the bank.”

<span id=""59"" class=""red"">Argentina’s central bank estimates that Argentine households and nonfinancial firms hold more <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $230 billion</span> in foreign financial assets, mostly denominated in U.S. currency.</span> Most of that money is held in international bank accounts, but some is also stashed in safes and hiding places across the country.
<span id=""60"" class=""red"">That dependence on the dollar is bad for the peso, so the government restricts Argentines from buying more <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 in</span> U.S. currency each month.</span> For that amount, Argentines can use the official government exchange rate, which says each U.S. dollar is worth <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 130 pesos</span>.
<span id=""61"" class=""red"">But a different exchange rate — used for Western Union wires, certain corporate transactions, and the black market — values the peso at less than half that: Each dollar is now worth <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 300 pesos</span>.</span> <span id=""62"" class=""red"">(Because this rate is a truer measure of the open market’s view of the peso, we used it to convert values in this article.)
</span>In downtown Buenos Aires, men and women dubbed “arbolitos,” or little trees, stand on street corners hawking dollars. They lead buyers to so-called caves to change the money in private.
It’s all illegal, but police standing nearby don’t seem to mind. <span id=""63"" class=""red"">Many use the market themselves.
</span>Juan, a money changer who delivers wads of cash on his motorbike, said three of his regular customers are police officers. Even so, he agreed to speak on the condition that only his first name be used.
<span id=""64"" class=""red"">Money changers and cave managers estimated the black market <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">moves $3 million</span> <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $4 million</span> a day.</span> <span id=""65"" class=""red"">Those dollars underpin much of the economy here.
</span>Yanina Arias, a Buenos Aires real-estate agent, said she has completed hundreds of deals over her 10-year career, but never one in pesos. Sellers often require “dollar bills without stains, without rips, and that are big-faced,” Ms. Arias said. “Small-faced bills are not accepted.”
The face in question is Benjamin Franklin’s. <span id=""66"" class=""red"">The black market generally <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offers 3 percent</span> more for <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">newer $100 notes</span> with Mr. Franklin’s enlarged portrait because they are harder to counterfeit.
</span>Seven Argentines described paying for properties in cash, but few were willing to allow their names to be printed because they were worried about being audited.
To head to the bank to close the deal, they described stuffing tens of thousands of dollars down their pants and into grocery bags full of produce. Ms. Arias said wealthier people have hired armored trucks.
<span id=""67"" class=""red"">A financial-services worker in Buenos Aires said that when she sold her family’s farm <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1 million</span> a few years ago, the buyer handed her a duffel bag full <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10,000 </span></span>$100 bills.</span> Later, when she bought her apartment, she <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">put $100,000 of</span> the cash into the pockets of an oversized coat and hustled to the buyers’ home. The sellers, an older couple, insisted on counting each bill by hand.
<span id=""68"" class=""red"">Trading milk for diapers
After Adela Castillo and her husband lost their jobs during the pandemic — she was a caretaker and he worked in shipping — they took a big risk.</span> They converted their home in one of Buenos Aires’s poorest neighborhoods into a shop selling cement, limestone, paint and plasterboard.
At first, it was paying off. <span id=""69"" class=""red"">The government was building new affordable housing in the neighborhood, and it became a big buyer.</span> To keep up, she needed a forklift. And to buy one, she <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needed $15,000 in</span> cash.
A bank would never make that kind of loan, but luckily, she had a family friend who had that much stashed away. “A huge favor,” she said. “Nobody lends you money like that.”
She bought the forklift. “It helped a ton,” she said. Then the value of the peso continued to plummet. “He wants me to pay back in dollars. He doesn’t want pesos,” she said. <span id=""70"" class=""red"">With each decline in the value of the peso, her debt has effectively grown bigger.
</span>“It’s a screwed-up situation,” she said, standing outside her shop, limestone dust in her hair and down her fleece. She was not sure how she would pay it off. “We’re treading water,” she said. “We’re fighting.”
With the peso losing so much value, some poor Argentines are trying to avoid it altogether.
Silvina López,<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 37,</span> was standing in the biting cold with her infant. She needed diapers but she was broke. After a stroke, Ms. López was blind in one eye and didn’t work, while her husband was a construction laborer when it was sunny. <span id=""71"" class=""red"">But his wages — <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $7 a</span> day — hadn’t increased while the prices did.
</span>But here, next to a bus stop in the poor suburb of Lomas de Zamora, she didn’t need pesos. <span id=""72"" class=""red"">Instead, she had sacks of powdered milk, handouts from the government that she could trade in order to make sure her 1-month-old, Milagro, or Miracle in Spanish, had diapers.
</span>Another woman had set up shop on the street corner to barter, and she traded Ms. López a 12-pack of diapers, two bags of sugar and a box of cookies for the powdered milk. Ms. López’s 8-year-old daughter, Mia, immediately tore into the cookies.
“My family, my siblings, they all come here,” she said. “They have lots of children, too.”
During the recession that accompanied <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2001 run</span> on the banks, a half-million people were regularly meeting in so-called “trueque” clubs, or bartering exchanges, to swap goods without pesos. <span id=""73"" class=""red"">The clubs largely disintegrated over the years, but with inflation again soaring, they are making a comeback.
</span>On a recent Sunday, <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 100 people</span> hustled among two dozen tables, swapping their wares: used clothes, cleaning supplies, homemade pizza dough, insecticide, fried quince pastries. <span id=""74"" class=""red"">To facilitate the trades, they used “créditos,” the club’s own currency, printed onto white paper.
</span>Women clutched handfuls of the notes as they shopped at their neighbors’ tables. They all said they preferred the crédito to the peso.
At one point, an organizer who was selling Avon makeup, Karina Sanchez, paused the cumbia music to make an announcement: They were exchanging older, smaller denomination créditos for newer, larger ones. She showed much older notes worth one-half a crédito. Last year, they introduced <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1,000</span>-crédito note.
<span id=""75"" class=""red"">Yes, Ms. Sanchez said, the crédito was experiencing inflation, too.

54618,"<h3>Meet the Biggest Prankster in Baseball: Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman</h3>Before <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 2 of</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2019 American</span> League Championship Series last October, the Yankees’ third-base coach, Phil Nevin, was sitting at a table in the visiting team’s food room at Minute Maid Park. A clubhouse attendant appeared and told Nevin he had a visitor waiting in the hallway: Alex Cintron, the hitting coach of the Houston Astros.
This was alarming: During <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 1 the</span> day before, the Yankees had shouted angrily at the Astros because they heard whistling coming from the vicinity of the Houston dugout. (This was before the Astros admitted to, and were penalized for, cheating in previous seasons, but opponents had long been suspicious.)
Whether the whistling was simply gamesmanship or something more nefarious, Nevin didn’t like it, or how Cintron was behaving. So he had sent a threat to Cintron — something about meeting anyplace at any time to settle a score — via Astros third baseman Alex Bregman.
But when Nevin burst through the clubhouse doors, Cintron wasn’t there. Instead, it was Yankees Manager Aaron Boone and General Manager Brian Cashman, who was the prank’s mastermind, with cellphones out to capture it on video.
“I couldn’t stop laughing after that,” Cashman said. “When he walked out, he had his game face on.”
<span id=""0"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">For 23 years</span>, Cashman has held one of the most high-profile and demanding jobs in sports: the Yankees’ general manager.</span> In that span — much of it under George Steinbrenner, the exacting and fiery owner who died <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 </span>— the Yankees have <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 2,131 regular</span>-season games, more than any other franchise in the major leagues; reached the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">playoffs 19 times</span>, including this year; and claimed four World Series titles, the last coming <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> an eternity in the Bronx.
Cashman,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 53,</span> is also highly accomplished in another category: pranks. Many inside the Yankees’ organization — from the principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, George’s son, to the Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera — have stories about being on the receiving end of a Cashman practical joke.
“He’s one of the best at it,” said Jim Hendry, the Yankees’ special assistant scout and a former Chicago Cubs general manager.
Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame outfielder who is now a Yankees special adviser, added, “He’s always trying something.”
Making personnel decisions for one of the most valuable pro sports franchises in the world can be stressful, and Cashman has used his pranks to defuse tension or produce a few smiles amid it all — especially during a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">challenging 2020 season</span> complicated by the pandemic.
“It’s just something that feels like it could lighten the load,” Cashman said. “Bottom line: Every day is a day of importance, so any day you can have fun while you’re doing fun work. I just like to have fun.”
Cashman’s mischievous streak dates at least to college, he said. One of the earliest pranks he remembered pulling with the Yankees, with whom he started full time <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> came when he was an assistant general manager, a position he held <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1992 to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1998.</span>
From a blocked number, Cashman called one of his mentors and favorite targets, Gene Michael, the former Yankees general manager and manager whose work had laid the foundation for four World Series teams. The Florida Marlins had a managerial opening, so Cashman, disguising his voice and posing as a Miami Herald reporter, told Michael — a scout for the Yankees at the time — that he was on a shortlist for the position.
“Oh man, it was like hook, line and sinker,” Cashman said. “He goes: ‘I certainly can’t comment on that. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But off the record, of course I would have interest.’</span> I started laughing, and he was like: ‘Who is this? Who is this?’ I told him. I was crying because I was laughing so hard.”
Cashman couldn’t recall exactly why he had targeted Michael — probably revenge for a joke Michael had at his expense, he said. Cashman, after all, has pulled so many pranks over the years he can’t remember every one.
“The more august he has gone into his general managership, he doesn’t do those nasty, vicious ones,” said the Yankees assistant general manager Jean Afterman, who added that Cashman has joked with her but “would never dare” prank her, because she could easily get him back.
Afterman, though, has helped Cashman with some of his mischief. Cashman had once been using a cheap machine that produced fake flatulence, and she bought him a higher-quality one she called “the <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fartmaster 4000.</span>” (Cashman has burned through many of those.) He hid the device in the visiting players’ lounge at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 World</span> Series and watched from an adjacent room.
“In a moment when he felt that everybody was serious, he had the remote in his hand and pushed the button,” said Billy Eppler, a former Yankees assistant general manager who was most recently the Los Angeles Angels’ general manager.
During <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2005 winter</span> meetings, an annual baseball convention, Cashman deployed both a flatulence machine and a little trickery on reporters who were interviewing him in a hotel suite. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Cashman intentionally left a piece of paper on a coffee table with a fictional trade proposal with the Milwaukee Brewers that said something along the lines of: “We get Ben Sheets.</span> They get Robinson Cano and Chien-Ming Wang.”
Thinking he had a scoop, Mark Feinsand, who covered the Yankees for MLB.com, placed his notebook on the paper and planned to discreetly follow up with Cashman afterward. “I had to do the big reveal because I didn’t want him to write a false story,” Cashman said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Cashman has used the fake trade bit on his employees, too.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He once changed the contact information in his cellphone for a rival general manager so that he could trick Matt Ferry, the Yankees’ director of baseball operations, into thinking he had completed a trade that Ferry opposed.</span> In reality, Cashman was simply texting himself.
“It’s just naturally part of his personality,” Eppler said. “He just has a really good understanding of tone and timing. He knows there’s times to be serious and times we can laugh a little bit. He understands that’s a good medicine.”
Planning for the annual draft can be one of the more stressful tasks for the Yankees’ front office, said Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees’ vice president for domestic amateur scouting. But when Cashman arrives every year to the team’s facility in Tampa, Fla., Oppenheimer said, he can put people at ease with his laid-back attire (flip flops, T-shirt and shorts) and his humor.
Around the time of one draft, Oppenheimer said, Cashman used the flatulence machine on him while they were ordering dinner at a restaurant.
“You have to tell the waitress because she’s not going to say anything,” Oppenheimer said, laughing, “but you’re like, ‘This is what we deal with.’”
Cashman said he was fair game for pranks, too. Afterman said she once pranked Cashman years ago with a fake waiver claim for a player who was owed a lot of money.
Phillies Manager Joe Girardi, who was the Yankees’ manager <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2008 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> said he “always” got Cashman back but only vaguely elaborated. “Some of the same things he did to me,” Girardi said.
Pranks have been harder to pull off this season with so many front office staffers working remotely, Cashman said. But recently, when Matt Daley, a director of pro scouting, who lives in New Jersey, went to Yankee Stadium for a meeting held mostly on Zoom to go over the team’s potential playoff opponents, Cashman had a rare in-person target.
So Cashman said he sneaked out of his office and tossed party snaps — the type that make firecracker-like sounds — into the conference room where Daley was sitting during the video call.
Eppler said he had also been the target of party snap blitzes during presentations, as well as a clicker pen that shocks users. Cashman occasionally gave it to him when he was signing official documents.
“I’ve probably forgotten half the stuff I’ve pulled,” Cashman said.
He did remember, though, a few he had inflicted on players. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He was the architect behind the drafting of a prank letter from the Internal Revenue Service to Rivera <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> the final season of the pitcher’s 19-year career, about a payment owed on behalf of his charity.
</span>“He was so nervous because the number was so astronomical,” Cashman said.
Cashman said he once gave the former outfielder Nick Swisher a prank scratch lottery ticket that produced <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $50,000 winner</span>. (He told Swisher he had picked it up at a gas station on the way to Yankee Stadium that day.) Swisher, in the middle of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $27 million</span> contract, raced up and down the hallways in delight at his apparent good fortune.
The instructions on the back read: “Claim forms supplied by Santa Claus. All winning tickets must be validated by the Tooth Fairy and conform to her game rules.” (Cashman keeps these and the party snaps in his office desk.)
As he told his side of Cashman’s prank at the Astros’ ballpark, Nevin insisted he wasn’t looking for a fight with Cintron when he charged through the clubhouse doors last October. He said he expected to have a discussion, “not to knock each other out.”
He still laughs about the practical joke and hinted that he might get Cashman back one day.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“He does a good job of mixing the professionalism with having fun with the guys, staff and players,” Nevin said.</span> “It makes us all better. We all do it in here. It’s nice when your leader is the same kind of personality.”"

For those <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whose 2015 calendar</span> includes a retirement party, it’s time to get to work.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Even for potential retirees who have spent years planning and saving, there’s a to-do list that needs attention to ensure finances are running smoothly.
</span>Before collecting that final paycheck, new retirees need to make important decisions. And it’s not just money. There’s also the issue of how people are going to fill their time in a rewarding way.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You don’t want to see people just stepping off a cliff into the big unknown,” says Cheryl Sherrard, director of financial planning at Clearview Wealth Management in Charlotte, N.C.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Planning and talking about the things that are ahead will make for a much smoother transition.”
Social Security
For many retirees, their first step when leaving their full-time job is to sign up for Social Security payments.</span> That could also be their first mistake.
More Sunday Journal
Here’s why: Delaying Social Security at least until full retirement age (which is gradually increasing to age 67)—or, even better, until age 70—results in larger benefit payments. For example, for those eligible for full retirement benefits at <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 66,</span> waiting until <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 70 will</span> bring monthly payouts equal <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 132% of</span> the regular monthly benefit.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It’s hard to overstate how important this is,” says Cheryl Costa, financial planner at Forteris Wealth Management in Framingham, Mass.</span> “People shouldn’t fall into the trap of, ‘I have to file now because it’s free money.’ ”
Ms. Costa encourages retirees to visit a local Social Security office in person to see what their exact benefits would be. One option is what’s known as a “file and suspend” for the higher-benefit spouse, which could result in a higher benefit for the lower-benefit spouse until the higher-benefit spouse takes full benefits at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 70.</span>
Medicare and Health Care
Even if a retiree isn’t filing for Social Security benefits, he or she needs to sign up for Medicare at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 65 or</span> risk higher premiums.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It’s important to understand what your coverage will be, what some of your out-of-pocket expenses are going to be,” says Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price Group .
</span>Many retirees are surprised to learn Medicare doesn’t cover vision and dental, which is often costly for older adults. Out-of-pocket expenses for medication can be much higher with Medicare than under many corporate health plans.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Budgeting
More broadly, people approaching retirement should assemble a detailed income and spending budget.</span> It should include setting aside funds for inevitable emergencies or one-off big expenses, such as replacing a car.
Often this is a source of worry. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But David Lewis, a financial planner at Resource Advisory Services in Knoxville, Tenn., says he has seen both sides of the coin: instances where retirees have to tighten their belts—and cases where retirees are in better shape than they thought.</span> Either way, “the sooner you can figure that out, the better,” he says.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Ms. Costa suggests retirees live on their expected budget for at least six months before they stop working to see if it’s realistic.</span> “People generally ‘low ball’ their [spending] estimates,” he says, “and while it might make their projections look better, it doesn’t do anyone any good if the plan fails right out of the gate.”
At the same time, retirees—in the first years after leaving the office—should expect to adjust their budgets as they settle into their new lifestyle. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The earlier big adjustments are made—such as downsizing to a small, less-expensive home—the bigger the effect on household finances.
</span>Lifestyle
Again, dollars are only part of the pre-retirement equation. “Many times people haven’t thought about the nonfinancial sides of retirement,” says Ms. Sherrard.
Retirement can be a big change for those whose lives revolved around work. Ms. Sherrard encourages potential retirees to think deeply about how they’ll stay engaged and have a meaningful life—over a span <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 or</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 years</span>.
“A lot of people feel, ‘Oh, I’m going to play golf and tennis, and those kinds of activities,’ ” she says. “But when you have somebody sit down with an entire week that is blank… they’re at a loss for how they fill that time.”

94542,"<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady, Says Economy Is Strong</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Central bankers’ optimistic economic outlook points to a rate raise at their next meeting

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 4</span>:58 pm ET

WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady Wednesday and offered an upbeat assessment of the economy’s performance, suggesting another interest-rate increase is likely at its next meeting.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed repeatedly emphasized the economy’s strength in a statement released after its two-day policy meeting.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It offered nothing to dispel market expectations that it would deliver its third interest-rate increase of the year when it meets in late September.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,” the statement said.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In all, the Fed’s rate-setting committee used the word “strong”—or a derivative of it—six times to describe the economy and labor markets.

</span>Officials voted in June to raise their benchmark rate to a range <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span> They voted unanimously on Wednesday to leave it there for now.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall U.S. economic output expanded at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.1% annual</span> rate in the second quarter, the best three-month increase <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2014,</span> the Commerce Department reported last week.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">During the first half of the year, the economy expanded at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.1% annual</span> rate, slightly better than <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2.8% median</span> forecast for the full year submitted by Fed officials in June.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The question looming over the Fed’s meetings this spring and summer has centered on how much further officials believe they will need to raise rates over the next two years.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">In June, Fed officials penciled in plans to raise rates two more times this year and three times next year, which would push their benchmark rate <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 3%.</span></span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Officials estimate that moving rates about that level would effectively be tapping brakes on economic growth.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Traders in futures markets largely agree with the Fed’s outlook.</span> On Wednesday, they placed a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 90% chance</span> of a rate increase this September and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 70% chance</span> of at least one more increase by December, according to CME Group.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The challenge for central bankers is to lift borrowing costs enough to prevent the economy from overheating but not so much that it tips into recession.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Inflation is close to the Fed’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span> after undershooting it for many years.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Consumer prices in June <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.2% from</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Excluding volatile food and energy categories, they <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.9%,</span> according to the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed likes to maintain inflation <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2%,</span> seeing it as a sign of a balanced economy.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The threat of trade disputes, meanwhile, has added another layer of uncertainty to the Fed’s forecasts.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Wednesday’s statement made no mention of trade policy.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">By raising goods prices, tariffs could result in slightly higher inflation, though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated the Fed would look past such one-time price increases.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">A stronger dollar could also offset some of these effects by making it cheaper for Americans to buy foreign goods, pushing down import prices.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">A slowdown in global growth that spills back into the U.S., on the other hand, could prompt the Fed to reconsider its rate-rise plans.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Although we believe the move toward protectionism is a material threat to corporate profits and the economy, we think the Fed’s plan is unlikely to change,” said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities and co-head of multiasset investing for Lazard Asset Management.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Stronger U.S. economic growth over the past year hasn’t resulted in accelerating price pressures even though unemployment has dipped to levels officials believe should force employers to raise wages and prices.

</span>Mr. Powell offered a mostly bullish assessment over two days of congressional hearings last month. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Pressed over whether inflation was more likely to be higher or lower than expected, he said he was “maybe slightly more worried about lower inflation,” given the long period in which inflation defied Fed forecasts that predicted an imminent return to<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span>

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The Labor Department is set to report on July hiring this Friday.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">In June, the unemployment rate ticked up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.8% in</span> May despite strong employment gains, reflecting a surge of new workers who hadn’t been actively looking for work.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">This week’s Fed meeting was the first since President Trump last month signaled his unhappiness with the Fed’s rate-increase campaign, though Mr. Trump said he wouldn’t interfere with their plans.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, have said they won’t react to political pressure and made no mention of it Wednesday.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said on Twitter last month the Fed’s efforts to slowly raise interest rates from unusually low levels “hurts all that we have done” to boost economic growth.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">In effect, Mr. Trump signaled his desire to enlist the Fed in his broader campaign to narrow trade deficits.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Those efforts could be undermined if higher interest rates in the U.S. raise the value of the dollar against other currencies.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">A stronger greenback makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive in world markets.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump regards bilateral trade deficits as important benchmarks of economic vitality, though most economists don’t see it that way.

</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s own policies also have contributed to the stronger dollar because they are boosting growth and raising budget deficits, which places upward pressure on the U.S. currency.

</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">A Trump administration official told The Wall Street Journal last month the White House was comfortable with one more rate increase this year—but not two.

55115,"<h3>Both Sides Harden Positions on Anniversary of Nazi Defeat in Europe</h3>Both Sides Harden Positions on Anniversary of Nazi Defeat in Europe
PARIS — On a day of commemoration of the end of World War II in Europe, the war in Ukraine was marked by posturing and signaling on Sunday, as each side ramped up its rhetoric and resolve.
Leaders of the world’s wealthiest democracies vowed to end their dependence on Russian energy and ensure that Russia does not triumph in its “unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal aggression,” as President Vladimir V. Putin pursued his indiscriminate bombardment of eastern Ukraine and orchestrated celebrations for Russia’s Victory Day holiday on Monday.
A statement by the Group <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 major</span> industrialized nations said that on a day when Europe recalled the devastation of World War II and its millions of victims, including those from the Soviet Union, Mr. Putin’s “actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.”
The leaders, signaling to Mr. Putin that their unrelenting support of Ukraine would only grow, said, “We remain united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war against Ukraine.” The memory of all those who fought for freedom in World War II, the statement said, obliged them “to continue fighting for it today.”
The tone was firm, with no mention of any potential diplomacy or cease-fire.
In Moscow, as fighter jets streaked across the sky and nuclear weapons were put on display in preparation for Victory Day, Mr. Putin appeared to signal back to Western leaders that he was determined to double down on the war until he could conjure something that might be claimed as victory.
There was fresh evidence of that on Sunday, as rescuers picked through the rubble in Bilohorivka, a village in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine where a Russian bomb had flattened a school building the day before, killing people sheltering there, local authorities said.
“Most likely, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 60 people</span> who remain under the rubble are now dead,” Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. But it was unclear how many people were in fact in the school and that toll may prove inflated. If confirmed, it would be one of the deadliest single Russian attacks since the war began in February.
Despite the World War II commemorations in most of Europe on Sunday and in Russia on Monday, a painful reminder of the tens of millions of people killed, there was no indication that the war in Ukraine was anywhere near ending. If anything, all signals pointed in the opposite direction. Russian attacks on Ukrainian towns and villages met a crescendo of Western rhetoric, accompanied by the constant danger of escalation.
Mr. Putin, whose steady militarization of Russian society in recent years has turned the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 9 celebration</span> of the Soviet defeat of the Nazis into an annual apotheosis of a resurgent nation’s might, is expected to portray a war of repeated setbacks in Ukraine as a successful drive to “de-Nazify” a neighboring nation whose very existence he denies.
His much-anticipated speech may go further, possibly signaling that whatever conquest in Ukraine there has been up to now will become permanent through annexation. Russia annexed Crimea <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> began stirring military conflict in the eastern Donbas region.
In Mariupol, the Ukrainian port city now in ruins after sustained Russian assault, and a place Mr. Putin wants to showcase as evidence of his “victory,” the city’s last Ukrainian defenders vowed to fight on. Russian forces were cleaning the streets on Sunday in possible preparation for a celebratory parade on Monday.
Across eastern Ukraine, Russia appeared intent on making its occupation permanent through Russian flags, Russian-language signs and the introduction of the ruble. The Group <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 leaders</span> said any attempts “to replace democratically elected Ukrainian local authorities with illegitimate ones” would not be recognized.
Visits to the region by the first lady, Jill Biden, who crossed into western Ukraine to meet Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, in an unannounced visit to Uzhhorod, and by Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who appeared unexpectedly in a war-scarred suburb of Kyiv, were clearly intended to drive home a message of unwavering Western commitment.
Senior American diplomats returned to the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv for the first time since the war began.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine released a black-and-white video address on Sunday marking the Allied victory <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> Standing in front of a destroyed apartment block in a Kyiv suburb hit hard by Russian troops before their withdrawal from the region around the capital, he said, “We pay our respect to everyone who defended the planet against Nazism during World War II.”
Mr. Putin has portrayed Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, as the leader of a nation threatening Russia with revived Nazism. His aim has been to instill the spirit of the Great Patriotic War, as World War II is known in Russia, among Russian troops, but to little apparent avail.
In the vast Azovstal steel mill that is the last remaining part of Mariupol not under Russian control, Ukrainian troops again rejected Russian deadlines to surrender. In a virtual news conference, Lt. Illya Samoilenko, an officer in a Ukrainian National Guard battalion known as the Azov regiment, said: “We are basically dead men. Most of us know this. That is why we fight.”
Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the regiment, said, “We don’t have much time, we are under constant shelling,” with attacks from Russian tanks, artillery, airplanes and snipers.
The remaining civilians in the steel plant were evacuated on Saturday. Local officials estimate the death toll in the city at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 20,000.</span>
If the United States and its allies have refused to commit military forces for fear of sparking World War III, they have moved to support Ukraine in every other way, their determination mounting and their actions expanding with each Russian atrocity.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Group <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 statement</span> included a series of economic, military and judicial steps, with the apparent aim of bringing the Russian economy to its knees and increasing the pressure on Mr. Putin to turn back from a war of choice that has turned him into a pariah and threatens much of his country’s progress over the past two decades.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“We commit to phase out our dependency on Russian energy, including by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil,” the statement said.</span> It added, without being specific, that this would be done in a “timely and orderly fashion.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Alternative sources, they added, would be found to ensure “affordable prices for consumers.”
Russia-Ukraine War: Key Developments
A show of support.</span> In a high-profile display of solidarity with Ukraine on the eve of a key Russian military holiday, Jill Biden, the first lady, made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine. Canada’s leader, Justin Trudeau, also made an unannounced trip to the Kyiv suburb of Irpin.
It was unclear how this commitment from the Group <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 went</span> beyond existing undertakings, if at all.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The 27-nation European Union has already committed to a complete import ban on all Russian oil, with most countries phasing out Russian crude oil within six months and refined oil by the end of the year.</span> The European Union is too dependent on Russian gas to consider banning it in the short term.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The war has already driven up gasoline prices across much of Europe in a generally inflationary climate.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">If the war drags on for a long time, it is likely that support for the West’s commitment to Ukraine may waver among consumers paying the cost at the pump or in their utility bills.
</span>The statement of the Group <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7,</span> meeting remotely, said the seven nations — the United States, France, Britain, Japan, Germany, Canada and Italy — had already provided or <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pledged $24 billion</span> to Ukraine <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2022.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“In the coming weeks, we will step up our collective short-term financial support,” they said.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We will continue to take action against Russian banks connected to the global economy and systematically critical to the Russian financial system,” they added.</span> More generally, they would “take measures to prohibit or otherwise prevent the provision of key services on which Russia depends.”
Military and defense assistance would continue to ensure that “Ukraine can defend itself now and deter future acts of aggression.”
The leaders said they would “spare no effort to hold President Putin” and his accomplices “accountable for their actions in accordance with international law.”
The charges of illegality leveled at Mr. Putin for the invasion of a sovereign country are certain to anger the Russian president. The NATO bombing of Belgrade <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999 during</span> the Kosovo War, the United States invasion of Iraq <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 and</span> Western support for the independence of Kosovo <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008 have</span> given him a healthy distrust of American invocations of the United Nations Charter and international law.
War raged in Ukraine’s east on Sunday, with a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, gaining ground in the northeast. However, the Ukrainian army withdrew from the city of Popasna after two months of fierce fighting.
In general, the planned Russian offensive in the east of the country, like the rest of Mr. Putin’s war, has gone less well than planned. Mr. Putin’s broad aim, at least for the time being, seems to be to connect Crimea through Mariupol to other occupied areas in eastern Ukraine, and to Russia itself, forming a cohesive and strategic swath of territory.
William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the current phase of the war was at least as dangerous as Russia’s initial attempt to attack the capital and topple the Ukrainian government.
Speaking on Saturday in Washington, he said Mr. Putin was “in a frame of mind that he thinks he cannot afford to lose,” and was convinced that “doubling down still will enable him to make progress.”
In <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 77 years</span> since the end of World War II, the possibility of a broad conflagration in Europe has seldom, if ever, appeared more plausible.

44045,"<h3>Workers Seeking Productivity in a Pill Are Abusing A.D.H.D. Drugs</h3>Fading fast <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 p</span>.m., Elizabeth texted her dealer and waited <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 30 minutes</span> for him to reach her third-floor New York apartment. She handed him a wad of twenties and fifties, received a tattered envelope of pills, and returned to her computer.
Her PowerPoint needed another four hours. Investors in her health-technology start-up wanted re-crunched numbers, a presentation begged for bullet points and emails from global developers would keep arriving well past midnight.
She gulped down one pill — pale orange, like baby aspirin — and then, reconsidering, took one of the pinks, too.
“O.K., now I can work,” Elizabeth exhaled. Several minutes later, she felt her brain snap to attention. She pushed her glasses up her nose and churned <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 7 a</span>.m. Only then did she sleep <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 90 minutes</span>, before arriving at her office <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.</span>
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The pills were versions of the drug Adderall, an amphetamine-based stimulant prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that many college students have long used illicitly while studying.</span> Now, experts say, stimulant abuse is graduating into the work force.
Reliable data to quantify how many American workers misuse stimulants does not exist, several experts said.
But in interviews, dozens of people in a wide spectrum of professions said they and co-workers misused stimulants like Adderall, Vyvanse and Concerta to improve work performance. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Most spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or access to the medication.
</span>Doctors and medical ethicists expressed concern for misusers’ health, as stimulants can cause anxiety, addiction and hallucinations when taken in high doses. But they also worried about added pressure in the workplace — where the use by some pressures more to join the trend.
“You’d see addiction in students, but it was pretty rare to see it in an adult,” said Dr. Kimberly Dennis, the medical director of Timberline Knolls, a substance-abuse treatment facility for women outside Chicago.
“We are definitely seeing more than one year ago, more than two years ago, especially in the age range <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 45,</span>” she said.
Elizabeth, a Long Island native in her late 20s, said that to not take Adderall while competitors did would be like playing tennis with a wood racket.
“It is necessary — necessary for survival of the best and the smartest and highest-achieving people,” Elizabeth said. She spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her middle name.
Most users who were interviewed said they got pills by feigning symptoms of A.D.H.D., a disorder marked by severe impulsivity and inattention, to physicians who casually write prescriptions without proper evaluations. Others got them from friends or dealers.
Obtaining or distributing stimulants without a prescription is a federal crime, but the starkest risks of abuse appear to be overdose and addiction.
<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2013 report</span> by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that emergency room visits related to nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adults 18 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34 tripled</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2005 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 23,000.</span>
The agency also reported that <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2010 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> people entering substance rehabilitation centers cited stimulants as their primary substance of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">abuse 15 percent</span> more often than in the previous three-year period.
Just how stimulants like Adderall might improve work performance, and to what extent, remains a matter of scientific debate.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">But many young workers insist that using the drugs to increase productivity is on the rise — and that these are drugs used not to get high, but hired.
</span>“Given the increase in rates of abuse in college students over the last decade, it is essential that we understand the outcomes as they leave college and assume adult roles,” Dr. Wilson Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an interview.
Immediate Impacts
Elizabeth’s sleep tracker was confused. Her nightly rests were so brief, the iPhone software thought they were just naps. It recorded her average sleep over nine months: from 4:17 a.m. until 7:42.
After founding her own health technology company, Elizabeth soon decided that working hard was not enough; she had to work harder, longer. Sleep went from an indulgence to an obstacle.
So she went to a psychiatrist and complained that she could not concentrate on work. She received a diagnosis of A.D.H.D. and a prescription for Adderall in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 minutes</span>, she said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Friends of mine in finance, on Wall Street, were traders and had to start <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5 in</span> the morning on top of their games — most of them were taking Adderall,” Elizabeth said.</span> “You can’t be the one who is the sluggish one.”
Researchers in the field are quick to caution that, despite stimulants’ reputation as “smart pills,” few studies suggest that they improve a person’s ability to learn or understand. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">But they often improve attention and motivation, particularly for tedious tasks, which can increase productivity — or at least the appearance of it.
</span>Some industries have banned the use of stimulants for reasons of safety or fairness. The Federal Aviation Administration forbids pilots to use the medications under any circumstances. Major League Baseball players and other athletes had long abused amphetamines to increase focus and endure exhausting travel schedules, but the drugs are now considered performance-enhancers allowed only with a confirmed A.D.H.D. diagnosis.
Interviews with people who have misused the pills showed them to be a diverse group. A dentist in eastern Pennsylvania prescribed herself Adderall and other stimulants for years because, she said in a telephone interview, she could <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">see 15 patients</span> a day rather <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 12.</span>
Lisa Deese of Fishers, Ind., said she had abused Adderall as a stay-at-home mother of three for years. The pills, she said, “were like mommy crack.”
“I got so much more done during the day,” she added. “I was hooked by my first pill.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">While many studies have assessed the prevalence of misuse among college students, no doctor or researcher contacted for this article could cite a formal assessment of misuse among adults to improve job performance.
</span>But Dr. Anjan K. Chatterjee, the chairman of neurology at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and an expert in the field of cognitive enhancement, said that even without conclusive data, misuse was undoubtedly rising. “Kids who have been using it in high school and college, this is normalized for them,” Dr. Chatterjee said. “It’s not a big deal as they enter the work force.”
A Slow Realization
Sitting in a conference room at Timberline Knolls, the treatment facility, and hearing the details of Elizabeth’s professed harmless misuse of Adderall, a New York native in her mid-20s said pointedly, “That was <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">me 17 days</span> ago.”
The woman said her road to addiction had begun at her East Coast college, where Adderall was readily available from classmates <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $5 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10 a</span> pill, she said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">When her postgraduate job involved extensive early-morning driving and detailed paperwork, she began taking more.</span> She said friends in accounting and teaching were doing the same thing.
“Everything was just —” she said, snapping her fingers loudly. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I did my job faster than anybody.</span> I was on a mission, and I was not going to stop until I succeeded and got what I wanted.”
When she became too wired to relax or sleep, she added the tranquilizer Xanax to calm herself. She tried to stop taking Adderall, she said, but “became terrified that I couldn’t perform without it.” She turned to alcohol, then cigarettes and other prescription drugs to modulate her intensifying mood swings, before entering Timberline for five weeks.
The number of stimulant misusers who become addicted is unclear. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But supply has risen sharply: <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 2.6 million</span> American adults received A.D.H.D. medication in<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> a rise <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 53 percent</span> in only four years, according to Express Scripts, the nation’s largest prescription-drug manager.</span> Use among <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adults 26 to</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34 almost</span> doubled.
Most experts say a proper evaluation for the disorder typically requires an extensive inquiry into a patient’s history of impulsivity and inattention. Yet misusers routinely described brief chats with doctors to get a prescription. Two lawyers in Houston said wearing a suit to their appointments guaranteed no scrutiny.
Those lawyers said they and dozens of young colleagues at their firms had casually traded pills to work into the night and billed hundreds of extra hours a year in the race for partnerships.
One said he had originally <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 20 milligrams</span> of Adderall a day, moving up <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100 milligrams</span> — almost double the highest dose recommended by the Food and Drug Administration — by getting prescriptions from multiple doctors, a felony in Texas. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">His productivity, he said, thrilled his unquestioning bosses and clients.
</span>Then came the downside: rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating and acute anxiety due to sleep loss. These overwhelmed any positive effects on his work performance, he said, and transformed his personality to the point that his wife divorced him. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">After he lost his job, he spent six weeks at a drug treatment center.
</span>“It’s a crutch, and it becomes a crutch immediately,” said the lawyer, who recently joined a smaller firm in Texas.
In her New York apartment, where floor-to-ceiling white boards were scribbled with nascent projects, Elizabeth considered what her generation appears willing to swallow for success.
“It’s like this at most of the companies I know with driven young people — there’s a certain expectation of performance,” she said, banging away on that PowerPoint presentation as her own pills kicked in. “And if you don’t meet it, and I’m not really worried how, someone else will.”"
69969,"<h3>Germans Forget Postwar History Lesson on Debt Relief in Greece Crisis</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">As negotiations between Greece and its creditors stumbled toward breakdown, culminating in a sound rejection on Sunday by Greek voters of the conditions demanded in exchange for a financial lifeline, a vintage photo resurfaced on the Internet.
</span>It shows Hermann Josef Abs, head of the Federal Republic of Germany’s delegation in London on Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1953,</span> signing the agreement that effectively cut the country’s debts to its foreign creditors in half.
It is an image that still resonates today. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">To critics of Germany’s insistence that Athens must agree to more painful austerity before any sort of debt relief can be put on the table, it serves as a blunt retort: The main creditor demanding that Greeks be made to pay for past profligacy benefited not so long ago from more lenient terms than it is now prepared to offer.
</span>But beyond serving as a reminder of German hypocrisy, the image offers a more important lesson: These sorts of things have been dealt with successfully before.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The 20th century offers a rich road map of policy failure and success addressing sovereign debt crises.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The good news is that by now economists generally understand the contours of a successful approach.</span> The bad news is that too many policy makers still take too long to heed their advice — insisting on repeating failed policies first.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve seen this movie so many times before,” said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who is perhaps the world’s foremost expert on sovereign debt crises.
</span>“It is very easy to get hung up on the idiosyncrasies of each individual situation and miss the recurring pattern.”
The recurring, historical pattern? <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Major debt overhangs are only solved after deep write-downs of the debt’s face value.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The longer it takes for the debt to be cut, the bigger the necessary write-down will turn out to be.
</span>Nobody should understand this better than the Germans. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">It’s not just that they benefited from the deal in<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1953,</span> which underpinned Germany’s postwar economic miracle.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Twenty years earlier, Germany defaulted on its debts from World War I, after undergoing a bout of hyperinflation and economic depression that helped usher Hitler to power.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">It is a general lesson about the nature of debt.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Yet from the World War I defaults of more than a dozen countries in the 1930s to the Brady write-downs of the early 1990s, which ended a decade of high debt and no growth in Latin America and other developing countries, it is a lesson that has to be relearned again and again.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Both of these episodes were preceded by a decade or more of negotiations and rescheduling plans that — not unlike Greece’s first bailout programs — extended the maturity of debts and lowered their interest rate.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But crises ended and economies improved only after the debt was cut.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">In a recent study, Professor Reinhart and Christoph Trebesch of the University of Munich found sharp economic rebounds after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1934 defaults</span> — which cut debtors’ foreign indebtedness by at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 percent</span>, on average — and the Brady plan, which sliced debtors’ burdens by an average <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 36 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">“The crisis exit in both episodes came only after deep face-value debt write-offs had been implemented,” they concluded.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings.”
</span>Policy makers have yet to get this.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">This is true even at the International Monetary Fund, which was created after World War II to deal precisely with such situations.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Its approach to the European debt crisis, five years ago, started with the blanket assertion that default in advanced nations was “unnecessary, undesirable and unlikely.”</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">To justify this, it put together an analysis of the Greek economic potential that verged on fantasy.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Even as late as <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014,</span> the I.M.F. held that the government in Athens could take <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">out 3 percent</span> of the Greek economy this year, as a primary budget surplus, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 4.5 percent</span> next year, and still enjoy an economic growth surge to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4 percent</span> pace.
</span>How could it achieve this feat? Piece of cake. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Greek total factor productivity growth only had to surge from the bottom to the top of the list of countries using the euro.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Its labor supply had to jump to the top of the table and its employment rate had to reach German levels.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The assumptions come in shocking contrast to the day-to-day reality of Greece, where more than a quarter of the work force is unemployed, some three-quarters of bank loans are nonperforming, tax payments are routinely postponed or avoided and the government finances itself by not paying its bills.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Peter Doyle, a former senior economist at the I.M.F. who left in disgust over its approach to the world’s financial crises, wrote: “If ‘optimism’ results in serial diagnostic underestimation of a serious problem, it is no virtue: At best, it badly prolongs the ailment; at worst, it is fatal.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Creditors, of course, do not generally like debtors to write down their debt.</span> But that’s not how Germany and its allies justify their approach. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">They rely instead on a “moral hazard” argument: If Greece were offered an easy way to get out of debt, what would prevent it from living the high life on other people’s money again?</span> What kind of lesson would this send to, say, Portugal?
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">But the Greek economy has shrunk by a quarter.</span> Its pensioners have been impoverished. Its banks are closed. That counts as suffering consequences. No sane government would emulate the Greek path.
Germany, in fact, understands moral hazard backward. The standard definition refers to lenders; covering their losses will encourage them to make bad loans again. And that is, let us not forget, exactly what Europe’s creditors have done. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Their financial assistance to Greece was deployed to pay back German, French and other foreign banks and investors that held Greek debt.</span> It did Greece little if any good.
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Greece has done little to address its endemic economic mismanagement.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">But it has few incentives to do so if the fruits of economic improvements will flow to its creditors.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">A charitable explanation of the strategy of Greece’s creditors is that they feared Europe’s financial system was too fragile <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> when Greece’s insolvency first became apparent, to survive a write-down of Greek debts.</span> Greece, moreover, was not an outlier but one of several troubled European countries that might have followed the same path.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">But Adam S. Posen, who heads the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says he thinks it has more to do with political cowardice.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Greece’s creditors were not prepared to take a hit from a Greek debt write-down and then explicitly bail out their own banking system.</span> So they resorted to what Mr. Posen calls “extend and pretend.”
“There’s an incredibly strong incentive not to recognize losses,” Mr. Posen told me. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Governments “will do things that are more costly as long as they don’t appear as a line-item on the budget.”
</span>There is a slim case for optimism. Today, the risk of contagion from Greece is low, Professor Reinhart says. Other peripheral European countries are in better shape. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">And even the I.M.F.’s economists recognize that there may be no way around a Greek write-down.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">The cost to Europe’s creditors would be minuscule.
</span>Yet Germany has not come around. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">It took a decade or more from the onset of the Latin American debt crisis to the Brady deal.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Brazil alone had six debt restructurings.</span> Similarly, the generalized defaults <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1934 followed</span> more than a decade of failed half-measures. Does Greece have to wait that long, too?
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">An earlier version of this column described incorrectly the period of time in which Brazil had six debt restructurings.</span> It was the 1980s and 1990s, not the 1990s."

14784,"<h3>Trump’s State Visit to the U.K.: Live Updates</h3>Here’s what you need to know:
Moments before arriving, Trump took aim at London’s mayor.
President Trump arrived at Stansted Airport, north of London, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 9 a</span>.m., but even before setting foot in Britain, he had ignited controversy by sending a series of tweets attacking the mayor of London. Moments before his flight was due to land, Mr. Trump took aim at the mayor, Sadiq Khan, calling him a “stone cold loser” in a series of posts. He then went on to compare him to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York.
....<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height.</span> In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 3,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019
Mr</span>. Trump has feuded with the mayor before. When large protests greeted the president in London during a visit last year, Mr. Khan allowed demonstrators to fly a giant orange balloon of Mr. Trump depicted as a baby in diapers. The blimp’s creator told news outlets on Sunday that the mayor had granted permission for the balloon to fly again this time round.
Days before Mr. Trump’s visit, Mr. Khan wrote an article published online on Saturday by The Observer saying: “It’s too late to stop the red-carpet treatment, but it’s not too late for the prime minister to do the right thing. Theresa May should issue a powerful rejection — not of the U.S. as a country or the office of the presidency, but of Trump and the far-right agenda he embodies.”
Mr. Trump will spend three days in Britain, first traveling to the American ambassador’s residence in London before heading on to Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. He will then attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster Abbey, have tea with Prince Charles, and attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday.
On Tuesday, he will meet with the departing prime minister, Theresa May, at her London residence and hold a joint news conference.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump will travel to the southern city of Portsmouth for a D-Day commemoration. He will then fly to Ireland on Wednesday afternoon, where he will meet with that country’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and stay overnight at the Trump International golf course in Doonbeg.
Mr. Trump arrives just as Mrs. May’s tenure as party leader is ending.
After two years of delay, friction and awkwardness, Buckingham Palace announced a date for President Trump’s state visit this past April, after Prime Minister Theresa May conveyed the queen’s invitation to Mr. Trump. He arrived in London on Monday — days before Mrs. May is to step down as leader of the Conservative Party.
When Mr. Trump did make his first visit to London as president, in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2018,</span> it had been downgraded to a working trip, without the pageantry. Mr. Trump was received by Mrs. May, Queen Elizabeth II and protesters. He criticized the prime minister’s approach to Brexit and took a weekend detour to a golf course he owns in Scotland.
This time, Mr. Trump’s penchant for uncensored opinions is likely to capture more headlines, if history is any guide. The turbulence has already started. As he did last year, before arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump spoke to The Sun tabloid and The Sunday Times — Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers — wading into the country’s political and social affairs and firing criticism at prominent officials.
Comments from Woody Johnson, the American ambassador to Britain, are likely to complicate matters. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, Mr. Johnson said that all parts of the British economy would be “on the table” in discussions over trade, including the National Health Service and agriculture.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The possibility of chlorine-washed chickens from the United States has emerged as a symbol of British concerns about a post-Brexit trade deal, but Mr. Johnson indicated that the United States would insist on access.</span> “You give the British people a choice,” he said. “If they like it, they can buy it. If they don’t want it, they don’t have to buy it.”
State visits serve as diplomatic bonanzas for the British government, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to have tea with Prince Charles, hold talks with Mrs. May and attend a banquet with the queen, among other events.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In April, Mrs. May called the visit “an opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship” on issues such as trade, investment and security.
</span>Weeks later, Mrs. May said she would resign, after nearly three years of trying but failing to shepherd Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. The contest to succeed her will begin on Friday, after she steps down as leader of the Conservative Party.
The president has been barred from speaking at Parliament.
John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has said that he would not allow Mr. Trump to address Parliament, as other leaders — including Presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, President Xi Jinping of China and former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa — have done.
<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> Mr. Bercow said Mr. Trump had “not earned” the honor of speaking to Parliament, and has so far resisted calls to let the president speak. Mr. Bercow has also declined an invitation to the banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday night, a spokeswoman for his office said.
The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, also declined an invitation to the state dinner. Unlike Mr. Bercow, he elaborated on his decision in a statement in April.
“Theresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric,” Mr. Corbyn said. “Maintaining an important relationship with the United States does not require the pomp and ceremony of a state visit.”
In The Sun interview, the president said he thought that the Labour leader was making a mistake. “I think he would want to get along with the United States” if he were to become Britain’s leader, Mr. Trump said.
He will meet the queen for the second time.
The world’s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 93,</span> has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">met 12 American</span> presidents, starting with President Harry S. Truman when she was a princess and heir to the throne. Last year, she sat for tea with Mr. Trump — who with the first lady, Melania Trump, appeared not to follow long-running protocol in which a bow or curtsy is customary.
One awkward moment, in particular, caught the eye of social media users: While they inspected her honor guard, the queen gestured to Mr. Trump and appeared to direct him forward. But he walked in front of her and then stopped, cutting off her path and forcing her to sidestep around him.
This year, Mr. Trump is scheduled to take tea with Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Harry is expected to join them for a private lunch with Mr. Trump, according to the BBC, and Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, will attend the state banquet on Monday evening.
The BBC also reported that Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex — who is on maternity leave after giving birth to the couple’s first child last month — would not be attending the dinner.
In The Sun interview, when the president was told that <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 the</span> former actress, an American, threatened to move to Canada if he were elected president, Mr. Trump said, “I didn’t know she was nasty.” Still, he said he thought it was nice to have an American princess, adding, “I am sure she will do excellently.”
Mr. Trump may meet with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.
Mrs. May’s rivals have already begun angling to succeed her, and the field is crowded.
The apparent front-runner is Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister and supporter of Brexit. Mr. Trump has voiced his support for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc — calling himself Mr. Brexit — and last year, he both second-guessed Mrs. May’s handling of it and said that Mr. Johnson “would be a great prime minister.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the recent interviews with the British news outlets, Mr. Trump again said that the former foreign minister would do a very good job, but added that his words did not amount to an endorsement.
</span>“Well, I like him, I’ve always liked him,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know that he is going to be chosen, but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person.” He added, “He has been very positive about me and our country.” (Mr. Johnson was born in the United States but renounced his American citizenship <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span>)
He also criticized Britain’s negotiating strategy. “I think that the U.K. allowed the European Union to have all cards,” he said. “And it is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage.”
It is unclear whether the praise will reap benefits for Mr. Johnson, given Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in Britain. Conservative lawmakers are expected to whittle the candidates to two. Then the finalists will compete for the votes of party activists.
Mr. Trump also said he might meet with Mr. Farage and Mr. Johnson this week.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">While Mr. Trump has had a sometimes strained relationship with Mrs. May, especially over Brexit and the possibility of a trade deal, he has found a more closely aligned ally in Mr. Farage, whose nationalist and populist Brexit Party did well in last month’s European Parliament elections.
</span>“Nigel Farage is a friend of mine, Boris is a friend of mine, they’re two very good guys, very interesting people,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday.

41923,"<h3>Trump signs $15 billion Harvey aid package after Republicans booed top White House officials</h3>President Trump signed a bill Friday to <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">deliver $15 billion</span> in disaster aid and also extend government funding and the federal borrowing limit until Dec.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> despite objections of Republican lawmakers who booed two top White House officials earlier in the day over the deal Trump struck with Democrats.
The measure passed a morning House <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vote 316 to</span> 90; every member opposed was a Republican.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Yet even the House Republicans who supported the bill were frustrated that Trump bargained with Democrats on Wednesday for a short-limit debt increase, undercutting GOP congressional leaders and setting up a messy end-of-year negotiation.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That frustration was taken out Friday morning on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who came to Capitol Hill to urge skeptical Republican lawmakers to back the measure.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">To many GOP members, the administration’s messengers were poorly chosen: Mnuchin is a New York financier known for his past as a Democratic fundraiser.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mulvaney is a former House conservative who spent much of his legislative career browbeating GOP leaders over the national debt and budget deficits.
</span>“There were probably a lot of members in there in disbelief,” Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said. “I do know that there is a lot of frustration with the deal that was cut by the president, and I think it’s a very difficult pill for many in there to swallow.”
At several points, according to several members and aides, comments from Mnuchin and Mulvaney were met with groans, boos and hisses.
Mnuchin, in particular, drew jeers after asking Republicans to support the measure for him personally rather than for the policy, then leaving the meeting early by explaining he had other pressing matters to attend to.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“His last words, and I quote, was, ‘Vote for the debt ceiling for me,’ ” said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), who leads a group of conservative members.</span> “That did not go over well in the room at all … His performance was incredibly poor.”
Mnuchin’s closing went so poorly, Walker said, that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reminded members afterward that hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims were counting on their votes.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">At another point, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) pressed Mulvaney on whether the Trump administration would commit to seeking reductions in the federal budget deficit as a part of negotiations with Democrats ahead of the new Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 deadline</span>.
</span>Mulvaney said he could not make that commitment, and members booed.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The debt ceiling is supposed to be at least a stop sign that gives us pause and gives us a chance to change the way we’re doing our spending, and it’s not even a yield sign,” Barton said afterward.</span> “In fact, it’s an increase speed sign right now.”
Democrats were expected to deliver a majority of the votes to approve the deal, making it easier for Republicans to vote against the package without the threat of failing to provide critical disaster funding as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida’s southern coast.
Republican leaders avoided an embarrassing benchmark by persuading a solid majority of GOP members to support the deal.
But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the scale of the Republican revolt on Friday was still “remarkable.”
“If I ever as leader or as speaker <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 90 members</span> vote against one of the easiest bills to vote for, which is disaster assistance, you know they have a philosophical problem with governance,” she said.
The legislation easily passed the Senate by a vote <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 80 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17 on</span> Thursday, despite similar concerns from Senate conservatives.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was among those Republicans who initially opposed the idea of a three-month extension of the federal borrowing limit, but he said Thursday he supports the legislation. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Ryan said he worries about the impact of continued reliance on short-term debt limit fixes on credit markets but that the package Trump agreed to is intended to create certainty while the United States responds to a number of natural disasters.
</span>“We need to make sure that the government responds to people,” Ryan told reporters at a weekly news conference. “So the president wanted to make sure that we are — are going together as Republicans and Democrats to respond to this.”
[Republicans jolted by, and Democrats wary of, Trump’s overtures to opposing party]
While the passage of the bill Friday defuses the most explosive items on the September calendar, Congress has not cleared all of the obstacles ahead. It still must reauthorize several programs and agencies before the end of the month, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Democrats have indicated they might use those deadlines to press for action to protect those at risk of deportation because of Trump’s cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as well as payments to health insurers mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Those fights, however, would not result in a government shutdown or federal default. That risk now shifts to December, setting up months of high-stakes bargaining that will determine whether Trump will be able to fulfill promises of increasing military spending and building at least a portion of a Mexican border wall. Also likely to become part of the negotiation is another chunk of federal funding for disaster victims — a tally that could increase dramatically with Hurricane Irma.
Among those most frustrated by Trump’s deal with Democrats were Texas conservatives who represent the area affected by Hurricane Harvey.
Texas lawmakers met Thursday for a bipartisan lunch during which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) called in and urged them to support the federal aid bill.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Many conservatives left the lunch saying they expected to take their first-ever vote in favor of a debt-ceiling hike to advance Harvey aid.
</span>Most of the state’s delegation supported the bill, but four Texas Republicans voted against it: Barton, as well as Reps. Sam Johnson, Jeb Hensarling and Mac Thornberry. The latter two men both chair major committees.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“I love President Trump, and I’m with him <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">probably 90 or</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 95 percent</span> of the time, but I don’t think it’s appropriate to raise the debt ceiling <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $19 trillion</span> public debt and not have any effort to change the way we spend money here in Washington,” Barton said Thursday.
</span>Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.), who represents a Central Texas district largely spared by Harvey, voted for the bill but wondered about its consequences Thursday.
“I just hope the president isn’t hurt by the long-term impact of this deal,” Flores said. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“You think about a Dec.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 debt</span>-ceiling deadline: The Democrats are going to play that for all it’s worth in terms of a government shutdown and trying to cut a deal that may have all of their pet projects in it, and that may be something the president doesn’t find to be beneficial.”
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">[Debt-ceiling shift signifies a remarkable political evolution for Trump]
</span>But others saw Trump’s deal as a wake-up call to Republicans.
“I think he sent a crystal-clear message that if we don’t get things accomplished, he’s going to find other ways to move the ball,” Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) said. “That should ratchet up pressure on the House and the Senate.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">On Friday morning, it was Mulvaney — a firebrand co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group that has railed against increasing the debt limit — who absorbed much of the House GOP’s frustration.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) rose to ask Mulvaney whether he <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 42 openings</span> for deputy directors at the Office of Management and Budget.</span> A bewildered Mulvaney replied he had only one vacancy.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Issa replied that was unfortunate, because he could hire his former Freedom Caucus colleagues so they could reverse their positions on raising the debt limit just like Mulvaney had — a response that prompted a roar in the room and caused Mulvaney, in several members’ telling, to turn red.
</span>Afterward, Mulvaney’s former colleagues defended him — to a point. “It’s ironic, but it’s not hypocritical, because he works for somebody now,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said. “But it’s ironic — it’s really, really, really ironic.”"
36631,"<h3>What to Know About Trump’s TikTok-WeChat App Store Ban: Live Updates</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">What to Know About Trump’s TikTok-WeChat App Store Ban: Live Updates
The latest economic and business news during the coronavirus pandemic.
</span>The Trump administration said Friday it will block WeChat and TikTok from app stores in the United States. The ban will take effect on Sunday and means WeChat users in the country won’t be able to use it to transfer funds or make payments.
Both apps, which are used by more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 million</span> people in the United States, are owned by Chinese companies. The Trump administration has argued that they collect data that could be accessed by the Chinese government.
The ban comes as TikTok is negotiating a deal that would make Oracle a technology partner while taking an ownership stake in the app. The deal is meant to address the Trump administration’s concerns about China’s access to user data on the app.
The New York Times has been covering developments between the White House and the two apps. You can read more about what’s been going on here:
China’s Powerhouse App Is WeChat, and Its Power Is Sweeping
For most Chinese people in China, WeChat is a sort of all-in-one app: a way to swap stories, talk to old classmates, pay bills, coordinate with co-workers, post envy-inducing vacation photos, buy stuff and get news. For the millions of members of China’s diaspora, it is the bridge that links them to the trappings of home, from family chatter to food photos.
Woven through it all is the ever more muscular surveillance and propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party. As WeChat has become ubiquitous, it has become a powerful tool of social control, a way for Chinese authorities to guide and police what people say, whom they talk to and what they read.
It has even extended Beijing’s reach beyond its borders. When secret police issue threats abroad, they often do so on WeChat. When military researchers working undercover in the United States needed to talk to China’s embassies, they used WeChat, according to court documents. The party coordinates via WeChat with members studying overseas.
Targeting WeChat, Trump Takes Aim at China’s Bridge to the World
Outside China, WeChat has mainly been a tether for the Chinese diaspora to their homeland.
May Han, a Chinese-born American, moved to the United States with her family when she <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 9.</span> Lonely when she first arrived, Ms. Han was encouraged by her parents to use another Tencent chat service, QQ, to keep up with her elementary school friends in China. They also hoped it would help her remember Chinese.
Eventually she made the jump to WeChat, where she still whiles away her online days chatting with <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 350 friends</span> and relatives, many of them in China. Now an environmental science major at the University of California, San Diego, Ms. Han said WeChat had become the cultural glue that held together much of her Chinese community.
“If we can’t use WeChat, our connections to China will decrease or even vanish,” she said. “Most of us have got used to using WeChat, especially older generations. Changing an app is not easy for them; it means changing their lifestyle.”
Trump’s Attacks on TikTok and WeChat Could Further Fracture the Internet
China and the United States have different starting points when it comes to governing high-tech industries. The Communist Party has no tolerance for its citizens speaking out against it online or organizing outside its sphere of control. It has also made no secret of its ambitions to cultivate Chinese companies’ expertise in advanced technologies, which foreign competitors say sometimes leads the authorities to give local firms unfair advantages.

The Federal Reserve unveiled a major update to its policy statement this week, indicating that it will leave interest rates on hold near zero until the economy has regained full employment, inflation has risen <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2 percent</span></span>, and those price gains look to be headed even higher.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">While that guidance lays the groundwork for years of growth-stoking monetary policy, Neel Kashkari from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis wanted to do even more and was one of two votes against the statement.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He would have pledged to keep rates low until core inflation — which strips out volatile fuel and food — had <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeded 2 percent</span> on a sustained basis.
</span>“I would have preferred the Committee make a stronger commitment to not raising rates until we were certain to have achieved our dual mandate objectives,” Mr. Kashkari wrote in an explanation of his dissent published Friday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed’s new guidance, had it been in place following the Great Recession, would only have slightly delayed the central bank’s timing on rate increases, he said.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Inflation did briefly rise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2 percent</span></span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span></span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He argued that the revamped language should not include a reference to full employment, which is nearly impossible to gauge in real time.
</span>Mr. Kashkari’s colleague, Robert S. Kaplan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, joined him in dissenting. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But Mr. Kaplan did so for a very different reason: He wanted the central bank to retain more flexibility, rather than indicating that actual achievement <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 percent</span> inflation was a necessary condition for raising rates.</span> That would create leeway to raise rates earlier.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The statement revamp came after the Fed reworked its long-run policy goals last month, making changes that would embrace periods of faster inflation and which enshrined modesty when it came to judging labor market hotness.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“They’re sort of on two sides of the discussion,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s Chair, said of the dissents at his post-meeting news conference.</span> “We’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework. There’s no cookbook.”

</span>The pandemic has had devastating consequences for a wide variety of occupations, but housekeepers have been among the hardest hit.
Seventy-two percent of them reported that they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Domestic Workers Alliance. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The fortunate had employers who continued to pay them.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The unlucky called or texted their employers and heard nothing back.</span> They weren’t laid off so much as ghosted, en masse.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The pandemic has laid bare not just the vulnerability of housekeepers to economic shocks but their total lack of leverage.</span> Several workers said they had clients who would not let anyone clean who has had Covid-19; others know clients who will hire only Covid survivors, on the theory that after their recovery, they pose no health risk.

CaixaBank and Bankia agreed late Thursday to merge in a deal that would form Spain’s largest bank and end the government’s majority control over Bankia, the institution that was at the heart of Spain’s financial crisis <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2012 banking</span> bailout.
</span>The all-share agreement was presented as a merger, but CaixaBank, which is based in Barcelona, will account for about two-thirds of the new bank’s combined assets, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 665 billion</span> euros, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $785 billion</span>. The combined institution, with an <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 20 million</span> customers, will keep the CaixaBank name.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The transaction comes after both banks have reported sharp drops in first-half earnings, at a time of record-low interest rates and as the coronavirus pandemic has plunged Spain into one of the deepest recessions in Europe.
</span>Many analysts expect the continued pressure on banks’ margins to force further consolidation in the sector. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">A merger between CaixaBank and Bankia “could revive moves by other banks to gain scale or strengthen their franchises or business models to remain competitive,” Fitch Ratings said in a note to investors earlier this month.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Bankia was formed as a seven-way merger intended to consolidate savings banks, known as cajas in Spain, which were crippled by bad loans, a result of the bursting of the country’s construction bubble after the onset of the world financial crisis <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But instead of shoring up Spain’s financial sector, Bankia ended up posting the largest banking loss in the country’s history and requiring about €22 billion in rescue funding, as part of a European banking bailout that the Spanish government was forced to negotiate <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span></span> As a result, the government also took over Bankia, which was then slimmed down to return it to profit.

12016,"<h3>No one expected a Stephen Strasburg extension. Then Scott Boras made a call.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">It had become a ritual for the Strasburgs of San Diego, an annual opportunity for a young family to sort out business, to assess the past year and look toward the future.</span> Stephen and Rachel, parents to 2-year-old Raegan, would meet for dinner at King’s Fish House with his agent, Scott Boras, in mid-February, before heading to Viera, Fla., and spring training with the Washington Nationals.
Boras and Scott Chiamparino, a top lieutenant, had driven from his Newport Beach offices. They chose King’s for mutual convenience — a 10-minute drive from the Strasburgs’ north San Diego offseason home, just off <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 405 for</span> Boras — and the food. They devoured plates of popcorn shrimp, crab Louie salad, clam chowder, fried fish and, for the health-conscious Strasburg, grilled salmon. Typically, they would use the meeting to discuss the specifics of Strasburg’s arbitration deal. This time, both Boras and Strasburg entered the meal with grander ideas.
Boras already had engaged in preliminary conversations with top Nationals officials, in both the front office and ownership, regarding signing Strasburg to a long-term contract extension. Strasburg, too, had spent the winter pondering the possibility, weighing his contentment in a city far away from the West Coast of his childhood that had slowly and unexpectedly come to feel like home. Free agency beckoned, but he felt the pull of comfort and familiarity. He wanted, he told Boras over fish and cocktail sauce, to stay in Washington.
When Boras left King’s, walking back to his car under the Southern California moonlight, he believed absolutely something no one else in the baseball world saw coming, even months later, until the news broke Monday night as Strasburg pitched at Nationals Park: Strasburg and the Nationals, he thought, would reach a long-term agreement to extend his contract. He phoned Ted Lerner, the Nationals’ managing principal owner.
“I think we have an opportunity to put this thing together,” Boras told him.
The following account, based on interviews with people directly and indirectly involved on both sides of the negotiations, describes how Strasburg, a former No.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 overall</span> pick as one of the most heralded young pitchers in a generation, and the Nationals agreed on a complex, seven-year extension <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $175 million</span></span>. The dealings offer a window into the often fruitful and uncommonly close relationship between Lerner and Boras, a show of Strasburg’s affinity for Washington and a potential road map for future negotiations over a contract extension for Bryce Harper, Washington’s other No.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 pick</span> and franchise pillar represented by Boras.
The discussions started Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span> a busy day across baseball, the deadline to exchange contract figures for teams and players for salary arbitration. “Frantic Friday, man,” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said. As Rizzo and Boras negotiated one-year deals for some of Boras’s Nationals clients — Danny Espinosa, Anthony Rendon and Strasburg himself — Rizzo broached Strasburg’s future.
Although Strasburg, a natural introvert, had been slow to adjust to public life, Rizzo had seen subtle changes. In recent years, his interactions in Washington gave Rizzo a sense he had grown comfortable in the city. Even though Strasburg had just one season remaining before free agency, a stage at which almost all players choose to have <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 30 teams</span> bid on them, Rizzo believed Strasburg might be interested in a long-term deal.
The suggestion didn’t surprise Boras. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The seed had been planted back in November, when Boras and Lerner met at the owners meetings in Boca Raton, Fla. Lerner, the 90-year-old Washington native who became one of America’s wealthiest men through a real estate business he began with a loan from his wife, Annette, outlines his offseason vision at their annual discussion.</span> Boras, the 63-year-old former Class AA infielder who became one of baseball’s most powerful figures, pitches Lerner on available clients.
“They have an incredible relationship,” said Mark Lerner, a Nationals principal owner and Ted’s son. “Scott really respects my dad and what he’s built over the years from nothing. They enjoy the banter back and forth. It’s an interesting relationship. They know how to get things done.”
[How the Strasburg deal may affect Bryce Harper’s future]
Boras explained how Baltimore Orioles slugger Chris Davis would fit into Washington’s lineup, hitting behind Harper. Lerner countered by saying he did not want an exorbitant contract like Davis’s tying up long-term payroll that would hinder signing Strasburg or Harper, who is scheduled to become a free agent after <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 season</span>. Boras made a mental note about Lerner’s desire to lock up Strasburg. Both men knew they would be in touch over the winter.
On the day of the arbitration deadline, the idea resurfaced. After Rizzo and Boras talked, Rizzo informed Lerner he should contact Boras. Lerner called Boras and invited him to his Palm Springs, Calif., home. “Come look at some art,” Lerner told him.
More than the public realized, Lerner viewed Strasburg with great affection. Strasburg in his eyes represented the growth of his franchise, a first overall pick who had validated the Nationals when he signed out of San Diego State, a foundational superstar who brought national attention with his sensational debut at Nationals Park <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span>
Third baseman Ryan Zimmerman was a National when the Lerner family bought the team, so Strasburg was the Lerners’ first great player and biggest splash. More than that, Lerner admired how Strasburg and Rachel lived quiet and humble lives, unchanged by his stature. He liked them personally and appreciated what Strasburg meant to his team.
In early February, Boras drove the two hours from his Newport Beach office to Palm Desert, the town next to Palm Springs. He met Lerner and Annette at Wolfgang Puck’s WP Kitchen + Bar. Over grilled shrimp and pasta, Annette chatted up Boras about art. Ted talked about baseball philosophy and a common perception: that Boras refuses to sign contract extensions, determined instead to take players to free agency. Boras insisted otherwise.
“No, I work for players,” he told Lerner. “It’s up to them what they want to do.” Boras told the Lerners he would speak with Strasburg about an extension. The dinner at King’s Fish House several days later would be the setting.
The security of a deal, Boras told Strasburg that evening, would lead to happiness and relaxed performance. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He laid out the business model of what an extension would look like, telling Strasburg he could expect seven years, with an opt-out clause that would allow him to reenter the free agent market.
</span>Over the winter, Strasburg had asked himself a simple question: “Why do I play?” He determined he wanted to win and to enjoy teammates. Both, he believed, could be accomplished with the Nationals. Strasburg also appreciated how the Nationals took care of his body. The team’s unprecedented decision to shut down Strasburg in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2012,</span> in the middle of their first playoff run, following his recovery from arm surgery bothered the right-hander then. But as time passed, Strasburg came to peace with the reasoning.
The baseball world thought Strasburg wanted to bolt for his home state in free agency. Even close friends admitted this week that they figured Strasburg would end up in California. The assumptions were wrong, misguided speculation about a cypher. He expressed to Boras a desire to stay.
With Strasburg’s blessing, Boras could begin full negotiations. With the Nationals, that meant a kind of triangular discussion. Over the years, as Boras clients Jayson Werth, Rafael Soriano and Max Scherzer signed high-profile free agent deals, the Nationals had developed an unofficial system for dealing with Boras. Rizzo and Lerner would talk about baseball markets and contractual guidelines. Boras would meet in person with Lerner. Lerner and Rizzo would debrief.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">[Max Scherzer’s bravura 20-strikeout performance]
So when Lerner told Rizzo he wanted to offer Strasburg a five-year extension <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $100 million</span>, Rizzo had to let him down easy — that just wasn’t market value.
</span>Days later, Boras was driving up Frank Sinatra Drive to Tamarisk Country Club, where the Lerners had long been members, a course not far from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 9,500</span>-square foot, six-bedroom Palm Springs home. Boras had met Ted and Annette at the club often enough to know how lunch would go: No matter how much he resisted or explained that he doesn’t eat bread, they would make him try Tamarisk’s renowned cheese bread. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">They chatted about golf and business philosophy and competition.
</span>They retreated to the Lerners’ home, where Boras had negotiated many deals and taken many meetings. As per their custom, Annette showed Boras one piece from her self-curated collection — a sculpture, on this day — and explained its history and how she had acquired it at auction. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 4 p</span>.m., the Lerners’ in-home chef prepared coffee and crispy cinnamon cookies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The meetings had grown to always be a mix of business and friendship.
</span>“It’s book-worthy,” Boras said. “The rare thing in life is that — who gets to talk to someone who is in gym class when Pearl Harbor is bombed and what Roosevelt said and his gym coach is Red Auerbach? Seriously. Ted’s amazing because you sit and you talk to him and you’re going through things for an hour, and then you <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 15 minutes</span> of things you’ve never heard anybody say in your life.”
For two hours, Boras showed Lerner binders of information about Strasburg’s potential, the needs of opposing teams and revenues across the sport. Lerner wanted to compare Strasburg’s potential deal to those free agent deals signed by former National Jordan Zimmermann with the Detroit Tigers (five years,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $110 million</span> ) and Johnny Cueto with the San Francisco Giants (six years,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $130 million</span> ). Those pitchers, Lerner reasoned, had accomplished more than Strasburg, who had yet to win more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 games</span> in a season and who had tossed more <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 innings</span> just once.
Boras showed him the recent contracts of the game’s best pitchers — Clayton Kershaw, Scherzer, Zack Greinke, all Cy Young winners — and told him to think more along those lines. Boras agreed that Strasburg could not match their accomplishments, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2010 Tommy</span> John surgery added another risk. But Boras laid out a case for why Strasburg fit between the groups: If his potential filled in, he would accomplish all that those pitchers had and maybe more. He sold Strasburg to Lerner, really, on spec.
Behind the scenes, the Nationals’ front office treated Strasburg’s extension like an arbitration case, looking up comparable players and contracts. It had reached a conclusion similar to Boras’s, settling on pitchers Justin Verlander with the Detroit Tigers (seven years,<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $180 million</span> ) and Felix Hernandez with the Seattle Mariners (seven years,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $175 million</span> ) as models. Even though those two had accomplished more than Strasburg, revenues had increased across the sport since they signed their deals.
The key to the negotiation for Boras was to create a contract that could provide Strasburg with long-term comfort but also keep alive the chance to enter free agency after he had accomplished more. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He envisioned Strasburg,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> having a minimum of <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $220 million</span> guaranteed in his entire career, plus the chance to hit the market <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 30 or</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 </span>— as Scherzer and Greinke had done — with a baseline salary somewhere <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $25 million</span>.</span> He proposed a “rolling” opt-out clause that would allow Strasburg to break a contract after three or four seasons.
Boras made three more trips to Palm Springs over the next two months, all the same routine — art and crispy cinnamon treats and hammering out the details of Strasburg’s contract. Lerner wanted money deferred to years after the contract’s conclusion, a common arrangement between the sides on prior deals. Boras would accept deferrals in exchange for performance bonuses —<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1 million</span> for every season in which Strasburg <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaches 180 innings</span> pitched — and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10 million</span> signing bonus to offset the lesser present-day value. Lerner agreed.
“It’s a pretty fascinating process when the two of them go at it,” Mark Lerner said. “My dad, he’s always loved to negotiate, and that’s a classic thing for Scott.”
Lerner and Boras had done enough contracts that those seeming intricacies came together quickly; they even used Scherzer’s contract as a blueprint for how Strasburg would be paid the deferred money. Lerner had made a fortune on far more complex real estate contracts.
The hardest part was haggling over the average annual value and total years. Back in February at King’s, Boras had told Strasburg he could expect seven years. He would not settle for less, even though Lerner had a hard time agreeing to even six.
During the last week of April, with the Miami Marlins in Los Angeles to play the Dodgers, Boras was eating lunch with client Jose Fernandez, the Marlins’ young pitching ace. He saw a call on his phone from Lerner’s number. He excused himself and listened.
Lerner agreed to a seventh year. They had a deal.
Strasburg received a text message from Boras asking him to call. When Boras gave him the news, Strasburg was elated. He called his family for their final thoughts before telling Boras “yes,” to proceed.
Finishing touches still remained. Strasburg would have to take a physical. Because the Nationals had never given a player an opt-out clause, it took their legal team a week to write and review the language. Meanwhile, the Nationals’ season rolled on.
Strasburg pitched for two weeks with the cloud of the near-finalized contract looming over his head. He told Boras early in the process to leave him out to avoid distractions. But Boras had to involve him in the latter stages.
“It’s hard to block something like this out because it’s your future and your kids’ kids’ future, too,” Strasburg said. “The bottom line is I play this game because I’m a competitor, I love the guy next to me and I want to do everything I can to help this team win.”
Boras’s stomach was in knots as he watched Strasburg make two starts before the contract was done. Any pitch could pop a ligament or a false step blow out a knee and could spell doom for the deal. The potential for cruel fate is why Boras doesn’t like to work out contracts midseason.
Baseball is a small world, so even a whiff of a potential extension could spread. But the Nationals, Boras and Strasburg kept quiet. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Well-connected team employees and most of Strasburg’s teammates didn’t know.
</span>“A couple guys knew,” Strasburg said. “But ones that did know knew to kind of keep it hush-hush. Some guys asked me how I was doing when I left [for my physical], and I said, ‘Nothing serious.’ They didn’t really pry after that.”
The Nationals were concerned questions would arise <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 30,</span> the second day of a three-game series in St. Louis. Strasburg had started the game the night before, striking out nine Cardinals and allowing two runs over seven innings in the 5-4 Nationals win.
“They say Washington is a town of secrets,” Boras said. “I now believe that it is. I was amazed. I told Rizz, ‘There’s no chance we keep this thing quiet for seven or eight days.’ ”
A first-class ticket in hand that Saturday morning, Strasburg boarded the first flight from St. Louis to Reagan National Airport. Team physician Robin West, an orthopedic surgeon at Inova Fairfax Hospital, spearheaded Strasburg’s physical. Among other tests, Strasburg spent two hours in an MRI machine. “Pretty much an all-day affair,” he said.
The Nationals are wary of the life span of a second elbow but believed in Strasburg’s health. Despite <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 elbow</span> reconstruction <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2013 bone</span> chip removal, the Nationals were pleased with Strasburg’s clean test results.
Strasburg could have been spotted in Washington while the team was in St. Louis, but his presence remained unreported, and he never worried about it, anyway. He left on the last flight from Reagan National the same day of the physical. Exhausted, he rejoined the rest of the team at the Westin St. Louis and went straight to sleep. He awoke Sunday and headed to Busch Stadium, happy he could throw his bullpen session as scheduled.
Strasburg signed the letter of agreement a week later. Word of the extension first came out during the third inning of Strasburg’s start Monday, delivered in a tweet by The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes at 8:06 p.m. Boras was at the game but unseen by reporters. After Strasburg was pulled in the eighth inning, he heard a fan above the Nationals’ dugout say congratulations. “The light bulb went off,” he said.
On Tuesday afternoon, Strasburg formally signed the contract in the executive offices on the second floor of Nationals Park. It reminded him of the day seven years ago when he had signed the draft contract that made him a professional baseball player. He had, in those seven years, become a star, a lightning rod for controversy, a father, a dominant big league pitcher, a man.
And now, as his pen met paper, he would stay a Washington National.

63851,"<h3>Chinese Textile Mills Are Now Hiring in Places Where Cotton Was King</h3>INDIAN LAND, S.C. — Twenty-five years ago, Ni Meijuan <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earned $19 a</span> month working the spinning machines at a vast textile factory in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Now at the Keer Group’s cotton mill in South Carolina, which opened in April, Ms. Ni is training American workers to do the job she used to do.
</span>“They’re quick learners,” Ms. Ni said after showing two fresh recruits how to tease errant wisps of cotton from the machines’ grinding gears. “But they have to learn to be quicker.”
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Once the epitome of cheap mass manufacturing, textile producers from formerly low-cost nations are starting to set up shop in America.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is part of a blurring of once seemingly clear-cut boundaries between high- and low-cost manufacturing nations that few would have predicted a decade ago.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Textile production in China is becoming increasingly unprofitable after years of rising wages, higher energy bills and mounting logistical costs, as well as new government quotas on the import of cotton.
</span>At the same time, manufacturing costs in the United States are becoming more competitive. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In Lancaster County, where Indian Land is located, Keer has found residents desperate for work, even at depressed wages, as well as access to cheap and abundant land and energy and heavily subsidized cotton.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Politicians, from the county to the state to the federal government, have raced to ply Keer with grants and tax breaks to bring back manufacturing jobs once thought to be lost forever.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The prospect of a sweeping Pacific trade agreement that is led by the United States, and excludes China, is also driving Chinese yarn companies to gain a foothold here, lest they be shut out of the lucrative American market.
</span>Keer’<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $218 million</span> mill spins yarn from raw cotton to sell to textile makers across Asia. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">While Keer still spins much of its yarn in China, importing the raw cotton from America, that is slowly changing.
</span>“The reasons for Keer coming here? Incentives, land, the environment, the workers,” Zhu Shanqing, Keer’s chairman, said on a recent trip to the United States.
“In China, the whole yarn manufacturing industry is losing money,” he added. “In America, it’s very different.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since Beijing and Washington resumed trade relations in the early 1970s, the United States has mostly run a huge trade deficit, as Americans consumed billions of dollars in cheap electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But surging labor and energy costs in China are eroding its competitiveness in manufacturing.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">According to the Boston Consulting Group, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have almost tripled in China over the last decade, to an <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $12.47 an</span> hour last year <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $4.35 an</span> hour <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004.</span>
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 percent</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2004,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $22.32 an</span> hour, according to the consulting firm.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies.
</span>Today, for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every $1 required</span> to manufacture in the United States, Boston Consulting estimates that it <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs 96 cents</span> to manufacture in China. Yarn production costs in China are <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 30 percent</span> higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.
“Everybody believed that China would always be cheaper,” said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. “But things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.”
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.</span> In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.
In recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2000 to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> Chinese companies <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invested $46 billion</span> on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.
The Carolinas are now home to at <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 Chinese</span> manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“I never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,” said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20 million</span>, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The inner workings of Keer’s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.
</span>Inside <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 230,000</span>-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.
The work is highly automated, with the factory’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 32 production</span> lines churning out <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 85 tons</span> of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 500 workers</span>, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries — a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.
The spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts — as long as the yarn is made in a member country.
</span>Sheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">“Common sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,” he said.</span> “Now some of that is reversed.”
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that “it’s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.”
</span>Investment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $70 million</span> factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area’s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 that</span> it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.
“The whole textile world is looking at us,” Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory’s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.
For residents of South Carolina, Keer’s arrival could not have come soon enough. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world’s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The global economic crisis hit soon afterward.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">By <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2009,</span> Lancaster County’s unemployment rate had <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 18.6 percent</span>.
</span>“They shut them down one by one,” said Donnie R. Gordon, who <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 17 years</span> weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“You could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.”
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases.</span> Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.
“I think I’m going to like it here,” said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni’s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer’s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.
Keer’s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">The outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer’s American prospects.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.
</span>Then there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 Chinese</span> trainers at Keer’s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers’ occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.
Robbie Sowers, a 32-year textile industry veteran who maintains the plant’s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes’ leeway before calling them late.
“There’s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.”
As she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100,</span> how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators. The screens flashed:<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 85,</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 90.</span> Experienced workers in China rarely let that number drop <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 97,</span> she said.
“They’re learning,” she said. “I have to be patient.”"
1787,"<h3>Sex Offender Registries Don't Keep Kids Safe, But Politicians Keep Expanding Them Anyway</h3>The first time Damian Winters got evicted was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> He was living with his wife and two sons in suburban Nashville when his probation officer called his landlord and informed him that Winters was a registered sex offender.
The previous year, when he <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 24 years</span> old, Winters had been arrested for downloading a three-minute porn clip. The file description said the girl in the video was 16; the prosecutor said she <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 14.</span> He was charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a minor and, because he had used file-sharing software to download the video, attempted distribution of child pornography.
Winters had no criminal record, no history of contact with children and no other illegal files on his computer. Facing an eight-year prison sentence, he had taken a plea deal that gave him six years’ probation <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 15 years</span> on Tennessee’s sex offender registry.
The day after his landlord found all this out, Winters found a letter on his porch giving him and his <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">family 72 hours</span> to move out. He ended up in one homeless shelter, his wife and sons in another.
He had no idea that it would be the last time he would ever live in a home. He has been sleeping in shelters, halfway houses and parked cars ever since.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“I’ve lost everything so many times,” said Winters, who asked HuffPost not to use his real name due to concerns that it would add to the difficulty of finding housing and employment.
</span>His years on the registry have been an exercise in hitting rock bottom and then falling even further down. He has attempted suicide twice and checked himself into inpatient psychiatric facilities three times. The strain of living apart from his family eventually ended his marriage. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Without an income to help keep his family afloat, his now-ex-wife had no choice but to take the kids and move back in with her parents in Ohio.</span> Winters can’t visit without approval from his probation officer and can’t afford the bus fare very often anyway, so he only sees his sons a few times per year. <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 29,</span> he still <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">h<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10 years</span></span> left before his name comes off the registry.
“I don’t even forge relationships anymore,” Winters said. “People are judgmental, so I keep to myself. I go to work, I go to sleep and I try not to think about what’s going to take everything away the next time.”
Winters is a member of an expanding and invisible American underclass. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1994,</span> when Congress passed the first sex offender registration law, the list was reserved for law enforcement officials and only applied to the most serious offenders. Since then, American lawmakers at every level have relentlessly increased its scope and severity.
The registry now includes more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 900,000 people</span>, a population slightly greater than Vermont’s. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 states</span> require sex offender registration for public urination; five apply it to people charged with offenses related to sex work;<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29 require</span> it for consensual sex between teenagers. According to Human Rights Watch, people have been forced to spend decades on the registry for crimes they committed as young <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10 years</span> old.
“When we first started talking about registering sex offenders it seemed like a good idea,” said Jill Levenson, a Barry University researcher and social worker who has published more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 articles</span> about sexual abuse. “But now the net has widened. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They’re for life, there’s no mechanism to come off and there’s more restrictions on employment, housing and travel.”
</span>The conditions imposed on registered sex offenders have become significantly more draconian over time. More <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 states</span> now require registrants to live at <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 1,000 feet</span> away from schools, churches and other places children congregate — a requirement that renders up <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 99% of</span> homes and apartment buildings off-limits. Some states require registered offenders to submit to regular polygraph tests and random police inspections. Florida adds “sexual predator” to the front of registrants’ driver’s licenses. Louisiana doesn’t allow sex offenders to evacuate from their own homes before natural disasters.
What explains these relentlessly tightening restrictions, Levenson said, is the domino effect that happens every time a city or state strengthens their registration laws. Politicians in neighboring jurisdictions, fearing an influx of offenders, feel they have no choice but to tighten their own. In April, Tennessee passed a new law restricting sex offenders from being alone with their own children, a direct response to a similar provision in Alabama.
Despite child sexual abuse declining <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 60% between</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1992 and</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010,</span> states continue to legislate as if lenient sex offender laws are a national emergency. And, like so many other corners of the criminal justice system, the crackdown hasn’t affected all Americans equally. State registries are disproportionately black and overwhelmingly poor. As demonstrated by the recent case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire long accused of molesting underage girls, local prosecutors and judges have wide discretion to overlook wealthy offenders while imposing impossible restrictions on poorer ones.
Sex offender registries continue to enjoy enthusiastic bipartisan support and meager media scrutiny despite any evidence that they achieve their stated goals.
“These laws are passed with good intentions,” Levenson said, “but they’re based on myths about sex offenses and they don’t keep people from reoffending. Community safety is important, but we need evidence-based policies that allow offenders to reintegrate into society. All we’re doing now is putting people in a position where they have nothing to lose.”
Sex offender registries are based on faulty assumptions and debunked myths.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While the criteria for sex offender registries vary widely between states, they are all based on the same two false assumptions: that sex offenders are uniquely likely to reoffend, and that notifying their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status will make that outcome less likely.
</span>The first assumption is based on the “stranger danger” myth — that serial predators commit most offenses against children. In reality, strangers carry out <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 7% of</span> these crimes. Statistically speaking, the greatest risks to children are their parents, other children and authority figures they know and trust.
Researchers consistently find that sex offenders are in fact less likely to reoffend than other criminals. A study of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1,800 sex</span> offenders across four states found that <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 10% reoffended</span> in the decade after their release from prison — far lower than <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 83% recidivism</span> rate for parolees convicted of other crimes.
Not only are registered sex offenders relatively unlikely to reoffend, but the registries themselves appear to have no effect whatsoever on recidivism rates. Numerous studies have found that enacting sex offender registries doesn’t reduce the rate of sex crimes and that states don’t see a drop in the number of abuse victims after enacting harsher requirements.
One of the most common restrictions on registered sex offenders is the “buffer zone” preventing them from living or working near schools, parks or playgrounds. While these restrictions may seem like an obvious safety measure, they too appear to have no effect on abuse or recidivism rates. An analysis <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 224 crimes</span> committed by known offenders in Minnesota found that residential restrictions would not have prevented even one. Another study in New Jersey found that <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 4.4% of</span> offenders met their victims in the types of public, children-oriented spaces the registry restricts.
“There isn’t any empirical relationship between where somebody lives and their likelihood of abusing a child,” Levenson said. Offenders will encounter children nearly everywhere, from grocery stores to city buses. The widest city and state buffer zones <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 2,500 feet</span>, or roughly a 15-minute walk. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">These measures, Levenson said, do little to protect children, but a lot to keep offenders from finding homes and jobs.
</span>If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that. If they’re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences. Michael Seto, forensic research director at The Royal Ottawa Health Care Group
Another common element of sex offender registries is public notification. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Every state requires offenders to notify their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status.</span> Some send out postcards to every resident within a two-block radius. Others offer mapping apps with photos and locations for each offender.
This, too, appears to have no impact on recidivism. In fact, most of the available evidence indicates that it makes reoffending more likely.
“There are already enormous barriers to reintegrating back into society after spending time in prison,” said Alexis Agathocleous, a civil rights lawyer who led a series of challenges to registration laws for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “Sex offender registries cement those barriers.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Winters said his registration status has made it nearly impossible to find employment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He worked at a Family Dollar before his arrest, but lost the job while he spent a month in pre-trial detention.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He lost his last job, at a cafe, because his probation officer forgot to file the paperwork noting his new employer.</span> The oversight constituted a probation violation, which landed him in prison <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 9 months</span>.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">He got a new job washing dishes at a local diner after he was released.</span> His boss knows about his status and even showed up to testify to his character during one of his probation hearings. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Despite Winters’ stellar work record, though, he can’t get a promotion ― Tennessee’s registry restrictions forbid him from taking jobs that could require him to supervise employees <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 18.</span></span> That also means he’s unlikely to get a raise from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $11.50 per</span> hour he currently makes.
“I don’t see the purpose of this other than keeping me miserable, poor and lonely for the rest of my life,” Winters said.
The rest of the country’s registrants face similar challenges. <span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2014 survey</span> of sex offenders five years after their release from prison found <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 36% had</span> never found employment.</span> Another, <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> found that Florida registrants in counties with larger buffer zones around schools were more likely to be homeless. Numerous studies have found that being out of work and living on the streets significantly increase the risk of recidivism.
“People are less likely to reoffend when they have a sense of purpose,” Levenson said. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“The more you’re able to build relationships and stay in stable housing and employment, the more you’re going to be invested in not doing something that will cause you to lose it.”
</span>And these provisions also make rehabilitation and reintegration into society nearly impossible. In some states, drug treatment facilities and homeless shelters bar access to registrants. Some bar them from churches, a crucial source of stability for adults trying to get back on their feet. Notifying neighbors can encourage vigilantism and abuse toward offenders and their spouses and children.
“It’s profoundly discouraging,” Levenson said. “For every other crime you go to prison, you do your time and the sentence ends, but for this, there’s no end.”
Registries don’t work for high-risk sex offenders, either.
Perhaps Winters is an unfairly sympathetic protagonist for a feature about the excesses of sex offender registration. He’s young, his crime was nonviolent, and he’s never been accused of inappropriate contact with children.
Sam Albertson, on the other hand, isn’t so sympathetic. <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2002,</span> he molested his 9-year-old daughter. Six years later, she told a friend’s parents, who told the police. Albertson served eight years in prison and was released <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> He will be on the registry for the rest of his life. (Albertson also declined to use his real name.)
The question for the state of Tennessee is what to do with Albertson now. As a condition of his parole, he is forbidden to leave the county where he was convicted. <span id=""13"" class=""red""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1,000</span>-foot buffer zone around schools and playgrounds, however, leaves him few options for housing.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">He drives a forklift on the overnight shift, but his wages barely cover a weekly motel room in one of the few neighborhoods where he’s allowed to legally reside.
</span>The fees that come with his registration status have also made it hard to rebuild his life. The state requires him to <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $40 per</span> week on psychiatric treatment,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $200 every</span> six months for a polygraph test, <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $200 per</span> year for the police to notify his neighbors of his address. If he doesn’t pay his fees, he’ll be charged with a parole violation and sent back to prison. A month after he first spoke with HuffPost, he moved into his car. Now that his registration status has been changed to “transient,” he’ll have to <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $50 per</span> month for an ankle monitor.
“I want to be a better person,” Albertson said, “but the system is designed to fail.”
Michael Seto, the forensic research director at The Royal Ottawa Health Care Group and a prominent expert on sex abuse and pedophilia, said that the current registration system doesn’t take into account the vast diversity of characteristics, motivations and recidivism risk among people who have committed crimes against children.
According to Seto, pedophiles — people who are attracted to prepubescent children — make up less than half of offenders who commit child sexual abuse. The rest suffer from a combination of mental illness or disability, other sexual disorders or disinhibitions due to drug or alcohol abuse.
Albertson appears to match this pattern. He said he’s never been attracted to minors. Molesting his daughter was an expression of emotional instability and his own history of sexual abuse, he said.
None of this excuses Albertson’s crime, of course. But registry systems rarely take into account the complexities of sexual abuse or incorporate evidence on the factors that will reduce reoffending. Even when they do split registrants into high-, medium- and low-risk categories, they typically base these assessments on their crime alone. This leaves out critical information about the circumstances of their crime and the factors that could lead them to commit another.
For registrants who aren’t attracted to children, restrictions like buffer zones around schools and postcards to their neighbors amount to disproportionate punishment. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">For registrants who are attracted to children, the high risk of homelessness, social ostracism and unemployment associated with their registration status may be pushing them in the wrong direction.
</span>“If someone has an attraction to children, they need energy to control and manage those feelings,” Seto said. “If you take away their social support and if they don’t have something to do with their time, you diminish their ability to manage their urges and increase the likelihood that they’ll drink or use drugs. That’s a much greater risk factor than living close to a school.”
Politicians are still unwilling to roll back sex offender registration laws.
The ineffectiveness of sex offender registries has been well-established for years, and yet lawmakers at every level are reluctant to roll them back.
Brandon Buskey, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Smart Justice Project, said he’s not aware of a single jurisdiction that has voted to loosen its registry requirements voluntarily. <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> National Affairs noted that no enhancement of sex offender registry laws had ever failed a floor vote in a state legislature. Many pass unanimously and few earn any critical media coverage.
“The logic is that if they save even one life, then they’re worth it,” Buskey said. “That’s the sentiment that is keeping them alive: You can’t prove that they won’t help someone, regardless of how many people we know they hurt.”
Courts, however, are beginning to find this argument unconvincing. <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> judges in California and Michigan declared those states’ <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">longstanding 2,000</span>-foot buffer zones around schools unconstitutional. <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina’s law banning sex offenders from using social media violated the First Amendment. The same year, a Colorado judge ruled that the “public shaming and banishment” caused by public notification amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The provision now applies only to violent offenders.
But the process of overturning registry restrictions is achingly slow and confoundingly specific. Earlier this year, Georgia struck down lifetime electronic monitoring for sex offenders but deemed it acceptable for criminals on probation. A number of states have ruled that registration is unconstitutional for juveniles and when applied retroactively — but acceptable in all other circumstances. An Iowa judge <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004 declared</span> that there was “no evidence demonstrating that <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2,000</span>-foot ‘buffer zone’ actually protects children,” but his decision was later overruled by the State Supreme Court.
Seto said one of the reasons for the ongoing push-and-pull over sex offender registries is that American institutions still haven’t decided what purpose they are intended to serve. When they were first devised, registries were primarily a tool for law enforcement. By now, they have become a form of retribution, a reminder for offenders and their communities that they are nothing more than their worst moment.
“If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that,” Seto said. “If they’re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences.”
A real solution to child sexual abuse, Seto said, would be humane, individualized and comprehensive. It would include more widely available mental health treatment for offenders after their crimes and the rest of the population to prevent them from happening in the first place. It would also involve educating parents about where the real risks lie, informing children about boundaries and consent and reforming law enforcement agencies to encourage victims to report — and take them seriously when they do.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And while registries do have a role to play in reducing child sexual abuse —most researchers acknowledge that some offenders should not be allowed to work with children, for example — this goal could be achieved with targeted databases that that function more like background checks for employers and law enforcement.
</span>All of these steps would finally align America’s solution to sex abuse with the reality of the problem.
“We’re always worrying about the creepy stranger at the playground,” Seto said, “but if we want to solve this problem, we have to improve safety at home.”"

<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 10,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 10</span>:18 pm ET

MOSCOW—When the Russian government needed to build up infrastructure in the southern city of Sochi ahead of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2014 Winter</span> Olympic Games, it turned to Russia’s most important lender: Vnesheconombank, the country’s state-owned development bank.

</span>Russian President Vladimir Putin said private investors would be responsible for most of the Olympic costs, which ballooned to an <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $50 billion</span>. But VEB ended up picking up much of the tab, eventually holding the equivalent of at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $2.9 billion</span> in overdue loans.

Now, the bill is coming due. VEB for years kept its books in balance by borrowing heavily from foreign lenders. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But after being slapped with sanctions by Europe and the U.S. following Russia’s annexation of Crimea <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> the bank faces the task of paying off <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20 billion</span></span> in foreign-currency debt, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 billion</span> of which comes due this year, with much-diminished access to capital markets.

</span>“On the asset side, the key problem is bad loans,” said Yegor Fyodorov, a senior credit analyst at ING Bank in Moscow. “On the liability side, the problem is that VEB was very exposed to international capital markets. And when sanctions were implemented, VEB was cut from this channel.”

VEB didn’t respond to several requests for comment.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The trouble at VEB—which has the equivalent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $56.9 billion</span> in consolidated assets, equal to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.5% of</span> Russia’s gross domestic product—is a significant issue for the Russian state.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">In late March, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the government will provide the bank with the equivalent <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.2 billion</span> so the lender can manage its outstanding debt.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Sergei Gorkov, the new head of VEB, said Tuesday that the funding had helped the bank to meet all of its debt obligations but that the bank would develop a long-term strategy by <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Russian authorities are already struggling to guide the country’s oil-dependent economy through its worst downturn in years.</span> Analysts estimate that VEB will need at <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 300 billion</span> rubles ($4.47 billion) in relief this year. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But the Russian government has pledged to hold <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.5 trillion</span> ruble budget deficit it projected in December down <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% of</span> GDP.</span> It has already slashed health-care and education spending and frozen pensions and state salaries.

“We weren’t very happy with the idea,” said a person familiar with the bailout plan for VEB, which <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 133 billion</span> rubles in the first nine months <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015.</span> “But there is an old rubbish bin of assets that someone should sort out—you can’t just pretend that this rubbish bin doesn’t exist.”

The person said the government was pushing VEB to both stop acquiring new assets and to sell or spin off some of what it already owns.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Bond traders are betting the bailout is a virtual certainty, sending prices higher.

</span>“VEB is one of my biggest bond positions,” said one trader. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The government knows that it will not let VEB default.”

Founded <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1922 by</span> Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin to foster trade after years of revolution and civil war, VEB was revamped <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 under</span> Mr. Putin as a development bank tasked with everything from financing major infrastructure projects to boosting exports.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> the bank turned into a dumping ground for bad assets and money-losing state projects. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">It bought two struggling lenders, Sviaz-Bank and Globex, to shore up the country’s banking system during the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> VEB bought the debt of a large pulp-and-paper factory on the shores of Siberia’s Lake Baikal.</span> The heavily polluting factory was unable to break even and it shut down soon afterward. VEB said in a statement that it planned to find a private company willing to undertake <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $88 million</span> project of rehabilitating the polluted area, but two years later, little has been done.

The bank has also become a lever for bolstering Russia’s influence in neighboring Ukraine. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The former head of VEB, Vladimir Dmitriev, told Russian television <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 that</span> the bank had <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $8 billion</span> investing in metals and mining in eastern Ukraine, where economic activity has come to a near-standstill because of fighting between Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed rebels.

</span>It appears increasingly unlikely that VEB will be repaid for the costliest projects. Many of VEB’s biggest debtors in Sochi are in talks to restructure the loans.

Russia’s largest state bank, Sberbank, for example, spent <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 52 billion</span> rubles in loans from VEB to build a major ski resort in Sochi, called Krasnaya Polyana, which records show <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 20.8 billion</span> rubles <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> In <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015,</span></span> Sberbank management told Russian news agencies that it was selling Krasnaya Polyana to another company that was created less than a month before the deal. Sberbank didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">VEB’s bad-loan problem worsened when Russia’s central bank, in an attempt to save the ruble from hitting record lows, jacked the key interest rate up <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% from</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10.5% in</span> a single night in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2014.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That move rippled through the banking system and sparked a wave of defaults, as institutions previously squeaking by with loan repayments were suddenly faced with interest rates they couldn’t afford.

</span>By <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015,</span></span> Russian government officials publicly acknowledged that VEB would likely have to be rescued. In February, Mr. Dmitriev was replaced with Mr. Gorkov, who previously held senior positions at Sberbank and at the oil company Yukos. The bank’s top executives aren’t the final word, however.

“In all of the key projects that are now the cause of their problems, decisions were taken by the government, and then the management agreed,” said Karen Vartapetov, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s. “So there’s not much that the actual management of the bank can do if the government asks or requests to invest money into some projects.”

79651,"<h3>Saudi Oil Attack Is the Big One</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday’s attack will linger over the energy market

Updated Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 7</span>:28 am ET

Saturday’s attack on a critical Saudi oil facility will almost certainly rock the world energy market in the short term, but it also carries disturbing long-term implications.

</span>Ever since the dual 1970s oil crises, energy security officials have fretted about a deliberate strike on one of the critical choke points of energy production and transport. Sea lanes such as the Strait of Hormuz usually feature in such speculation. The facility in question at Abqaiq is perhaps more critical and vulnerable. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Wall Street Journal reported <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 5.7 million</span> barrels a day of output, or <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 5% of</span> world supply, had been taken offline as a result.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">To illustrate the importance of Abqaiq in the oil market’s consciousness, an unsuccessful terrorist attack <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 using</span> explosive-laden vehicles sent oil prices more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $2.00 a</span> barrel higher.</span> Saudi Arabia is known to spend billions of dollars annually protecting ports, pipelines and processing facilities, and it is the only major oil producer to maintain some spare output. Yet the nature of the attack, which Iranian-supported Houthi fighters from Yemen claimed was the result of an attack by their forces, shows that protecting such facilities may be far more difficult today. U.S. officials blamed Iran and U.S. and Saudi officials were investigating the possibility that another Iranian-backed group carried out all or part of the attack using cruise missiles launched from Iraq. Iranian officials on Sunday denied responsibility for the attacks.

There are countries that even today see their output ebb and flow as a result of militant activity, most notably Nigeria and Libya. Others, such as Venezuela, are in chronic decline due to political turmoil. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Such news affects the oil price at the margin but is hardly shocking.

</span>Deliberate attacks by actual military forces have been far rarer, with the exception of the 1980s “Tanker War” involving Iraq, Iran and the vessels of other regional producers such as Kuwait. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">When Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1990,</span> removing its production from the market and putting Saudi Arabia’s massive crude output under threat, prices more than doubled over two months.

</span>Yet Saturday’s attack could be more significant than that. Technology from drones to cyberattacks are available to groups like the Houthis, possibly with support from Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That major energy producer, facing sanctions but still shipping some oil, has both a political and financial incentive to weaken Saudi Arabia.</span> The fact that the actions ostensibly were taken by a nonstate actor, though, limits the response that the U.S. or Saudi Arabia can take. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Attempting to further punish Iran is a double-edged sword, given that pinching its main source of revenue, also oil, would further inflame prices.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">While the redundancies in Saudi oil infrastructure mean that output may be restored as soon as Monday, the attack could build in a premium to oil prices that has long been absent due to complacency.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, traders may now need to factor in new risks that threaten to take not hundreds of thousands but millions of barrels off the market at a time.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">U.S. shale production may have upended the world energy market with nimble output, but the market’s reaction time is several months, not days or weeks, and nowhere near enough to replace several million barrels.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">After the smoke clears and markets calm down, the technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday’s attack will linger over the energy market.

Delta Variant and Rise in Cases Has New Yorkers ‘Scared All Over Again’
The city is grappling with a new surge in cases and questions. The only shared emotion is uncertainty.
For a fleeting moment, New York was a city reveling in itself. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Just a month ago officials declared it fully open for business; masks slipped to chins and restaurants packed in customers as vaccines rolled out.</span> The virus seemed to be losing.
Today, the coronavirus has crept back, in a new, more infectious form that has driven up cases and hospitalizations, primarily among those still refusing vaccination, sending a city just staggering back to life into a tailspin.
For some New Yorkers, scarred from the thousands of deaths at the pandemic’s painful peak, every new case, though few in comparison, comes with pit-of-the-stomach foreboding. For others, the spiking rates, and the fact that if infected, few vaccinated people fall gravely ill, portend a new reality of cohabiting with the virus — maybe indefinitely.
Perhaps the only shared emotion is uncertainty. As the variant known as Delta entrenches across the city, there are questions in its wake: Is this simply what the future looks like? Despite a maskless, celebratory summer of social closeness, is the pandemic forever?
“It’s like the flu, the flu never stops,” said Nelson Lopez,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 45,</span> a resident of East Harlem, who said he still cannot walk down his block without tallying every neighbor he lost to the virus. “People will be afraid forever.”
Over the weekend, Hua Cheng,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> and her husband, Keith Hu,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60,</span> both electrical engineers, drove in from their home in Randolph, N.J., to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a city that suddenly once again felt precarious. When they got out of their car, they pulled on masks.
“I thought I was safe!” said Mr. Hu, at the foot of the museum steps. The couple are back to wearing masks, even though they are vaccinated, as the Delta variant has continued to spread. “Before this we didn’t take it seriously,” Mr. Hu said.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that vaccinated people should return to wearing masks in public indoor spaces in areas that have recorded more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 new</span> infections <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">per 100,000 residents</span> over the previous week, or where more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8 percent</span> of tests are positive for infection over that period.
All of New York City’s boroughs fall under those criteria. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has resisted reinstating a mask mandate, said at a news conference on Wednesday that his administration was reviewing the C.D.C. guidelines. The mayor announced that the city would begin <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">giving $100 to</span> residents who get their first dose of a vaccine at a city-run site, starting Friday.
The seven-day average of new coronavirus cases is <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,000,</span> up from just <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 last</span> month, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75 percent</span> are attributed to the Delta variant, according to city data. Though the numbers of patients hospitalized for coronavirus in New York City remain at just <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 300,</span> they account for <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 75 percent</span> increase from earlier this month. The vast majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated people, according to the city.
“The Delta variant has really thrown us a curve ball,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference last week, at which he announced that all public sector health care workers must be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">On Monday the mayor expanded the mandate to all of its <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 340,000 city</span> employees, setting the deadline for mid-September.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that state employees would be required to show proof of vaccination or face weekly testing under new state policy that will go into effect by Labor Day.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Earlier this week, California introduced similar mandates, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced that all of its frontline health care employees must get vaccinated within eight weeks or face penalties, including removal.
</span>Latest Updates
For some, like Julissa Matos,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> the news has changed decisions about getting vaccinated: “I did not want to get vaccinated,” Ms. Matos said as she watched her nieces play in a fountain in a park in the South Bronx over the weekend. “I feel like they were just experimenting, and I didn’t want to be an experiment.” <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 45 percent</span> of residents are vaccinated in the borough, the lowest vaccination rate in the city.
On Monday, Ms. Matos took her 12-year-old son, Cleon Clarke, to Lincoln Medical Center in Mott Haven where they both got vaccinated, fearful that he might contract the virus when he leaves soon for sleep-away camp in Pennsylvania. Last week, an outbreak at Camp Pontiac in Columbia County, N.Y., had sickened more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 campers</span>, all of them too young to receive vaccines.
“As I am going to sleep for the past two weeks now, something in my heart just keeps telling me to get him vaccinated,” Ms. Matos said. “I am just starting to get scared all over again.”
Others say the increasing cases are not changing their behavior at all.
On Staten Island, Daniel Presti was helping set up a friend’s bar on Victory Boulevard on Friday evening. The bar he used to manage, Mac’s Public House, was shut down last year by the city after Mr. Presti and its owner, Keith McAlarney,<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> repeatedly violated city lockdown rules intended to reduce the spread of the virus — something the men said they felt infringed on their personal liberties. It became a center of the coronavirus culture wars.
Today Staten Island’s South Shore has some of the highest number of coronavirus cases in the city. Mr. Presti,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35,</span> said he does not believe the data showing rising case numbers. “I do not think that we should have destroyed lives for a virus that is highly survivable,” he said.
“I will not change the way I am doing things,” he added.
The Orthodox Jewish enclaves of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, were some of the hardest hit by the coronavirus at the peak of the pandemic, which tore through tight-knit families and killed influential religious leaders. For Tova Schiff, who is in her 80s and survived the virus, a possible resurgence is chilling.
Understand the State of Vaccine Mandates in the U.S.
- College and universities. More <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400 colleges</span> and universities are requiring students to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Almost all are in states that voted for President Biden.
- Hospitals and medical centers. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Many hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities, even within their work force.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In N.Y.C., workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or else get tested on a weekly basis.
- Federal employees.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">President Biden will formally announce on Thursday that all civilian federal employees must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or be forced to submit to regular testing, social distancing, mask requirements and restrictions on most travel.</span> State workers in New York will face similar restrictions.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">- Can your employer require a vaccine?</span> Companies can require workers entering the workplace to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to recent U.S. government guidance.
“You don’t know when it will end, or how it will,” Ms. Schiff said. “Will it get worse than it is now or will it just disappear?”
Ms. Schiff was hesitant to get vaccinated, but ultimately decided to get a shot. “I was afraid to do it, I was afraid not to do it,” she said.
Outside the Queens Public Library in Flushing, a group of young people were handing out fliers of information on the vaccine in English and Chinese to passers-by. In the New World Mall food court nearby, Cyrus Lee,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> was sitting with his 1-year-old daughter. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 85 percent</span> of Flushing residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to city data.
Mr. Lee saw the pandemic up close. His extended family in China experienced the virus months before it came to America, he said. When it arrived here, he cared for patients hospitalized for Covid-19 at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he is an office assistant.
His parents, who live in Sunset Park, hardly left the neighborhood for a year after the pandemic began, afraid for their safety after a slew of hate crimes targeting Asian people.
With the increase in cases, Mr. Lee said he was afraid the same violence would continue: “It never went away,” he said. “They blame Asians still.”
Hiking through The Ramble in Central Park, Navdeep Shergill,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 41,</span> his wife, Ajinder,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> and their three young children each wore a mask as they scrambled over rocks and down trails.
The Shergills were visiting from Folsom, Calif.
“Covid is here to stay,” said Mr. Shergill, who, like his wife, is vaccinated; their children are too young to qualify. “You can’t turn Delta variant off and go back to life as normal.”
Behind her mask, Ms. Shergill nodded. “This,” she said, “is a way of life.”

President Trump is an exception. In an interview with Time magazine, published on Thursday, Mr. Trump veers from topic to topic, praising himself and dismissing his critics in language that sometimes is hard to follow.
For a detailed fact-check into Mr. Trump’s assertions in this interview, see this New York Times article by Linda Qiu.
Here are several passages from the interview, and analysis on what they show about how Mr. Trump thinks.Continue reading the main story
An ‘Instinctual Person’
I’m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right. When everyone said I wasn’t going to win the election, I said well I think I would. You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, The New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1 percent</span>. Well, I said, “No, I think I am going to win,” and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed, you remember. He thought it was very cute, and very funny. Other people smiled. And some people, the smart people or the people that know me, didn’t laugh at all. There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn’t laugh at all. They thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me. They get it. — President Trump
If there’s one thing that Mr. Trump hates, it is being laughed at. That is clear from this response in the Time magazine interview, when the president dismissed the critics who found humor in his pursuit of the White House.
It is also worth remembering how flustered and angry Mr. Trump appeared to be when President Barack Obama made fun of him — and made a roomful of people laugh — during <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 White</span> House correspondent’s dinner. Mr. Trump has said he will not attend this year’s dinner.
No matter if the facts currently contradict him, Mr. Trump appears to have convinced himself that he will be proved correct — always — in the future.
Just Quoting
Why do you say that I have to apologize? I’m just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano. I quoted Judge Napolitano, just like I quoted Bret Baier. I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don’t know where he has gone with it since then. But I’m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks. — President Trump
Among Mr. Trump’s more bizarre assertions in recent days — and repeated in the Time interview — is the idea that he should not be held accountable for merely quoting someone who makes a controversial, even unproven, claim or allegation.
That idea flies in the face of the longstanding expectation that everything a president says matters. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Previous presidents have been careful, for example, not to say anything that could move financial markets.</span> Mr. Trump (along with Sean Spicer, his spokesman, who similarly quoted Andrew Napolitano during a briefing) appears to believe that quoting someone else shields him from that expectation.
* BONUS: Mr. Trump asserts in this passage that Mr. Napolitano had “three sources” for a claim about British intelligence conducting surveillance on Trump Tower. That is particularly ironic, given Mr. Trump’s attacks on the news media for using anonymous sources.
‘Very Sad’ About Sweden
I am talking about Sweden. I’m talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about. That is what I am talking about. You can phrase it any way you want. A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened. I talked about Brussels. I was on the front page of The New York Times for my quote. I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels. I was absolutely lambasted. A short time later they had the major attack in Brussels. One year ago today. Exactly one year ago today. And then people said, “You know, Trump was right.” — President Trump
One of the staples of Mr. Trump’s rhetorical repertoire is trying to rewrite what he said in the past to fit a new set of facts that has since been revealed. This passage in the Time interview is a classic example: His comments about Sweden during a rally referred to some alleged situation the previous night. Now, in the interview, he makes it seem as though he had been prescient, anticipating a riot that happened several days later.
Mr. Trump uses this tactic a lot. But he may find it more difficult now that he is in the White House, since by tradition just about every word a president utters is transcribed.
How Life Works
I happen to be a person that knows how life works. I said I was going to win the election, I won the election. In fact, I was number one the entire route, in the primaries. From the day I announced, I was number one. And The New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win. We thought we were going to win the night of the election. — President Trump
Central to Mr. Trump’s self-image is his belief that he is smarter than the people around him. Throughout his campaign, he often bragged that he knew better than the doubters, who he predicted eventually would be proven wrong.
In addition to contradicting some of his previous assertions (in which he acknowledged that he had not known whether he would win), this passage in the interview underscores the extent to which Mr. Trump rarely allows any self-doubt to creep into his thinking.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">‘I’m President, and You’re Not’
I inherited a mess with jobs.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can’t get a job,</span> O.K. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And I inherited a mess on trade.</span> I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder. But that’s the story. Hey look, in the meantime, I guess, I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not. You know. Say hello to everybody, O.K.? — President Trump
All presidents want to know how they are doing after moving <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 1600 Pennsylvania</span> Avenue. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And many denigrate the job of their predecessor; Mr. Obama often criticized the economy and the foreign policy he inherited from President George W. Bush.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump is no exception, and this passage shows his willingness to rely on the same positive jobs numbers that he frequently dismissed as a candidate.
</span>But his response at the end of this interview also shows how Mr. Trump’s mind works: His victory in November is the last word in the success of his administration.Continue reading the main story"

Instead, German prices jumped, sending yields plummeting, following the apparent collapse of a prospective Italian coalition government over the weekend.

</span>Mr. Gross’s fund <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.04% Tuesday</span>, ranking it last in performance among similar funds this year, data tracker Morningstar said. Similar funds returned, on average, <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.22% decline</span> <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 through</span> Tuesday, Morningstar said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Gross’s fund <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.34%.</span>

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The fund’s decline on Tuesday was the latest setback for Mr. Gross, the onetime “bond king” who built Pacific Investment Management Co. into a dominant force in the debt markets, with more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 billion</span> at one point under management in his Total Return Bond Fund.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Gross appeared to signal a call for selling German bonds in his first-quarter letter to investors, noting that a March statement by the European Central Bank had paved the way for higher interest rates across the continent.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Unconstrained bond funds like Mr. Gross’s are free to invest in a wider array of securities than those with more traditional fixed-income investments, like U.S. government and corporate bonds.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The declines in Mr. Gross’s fund are an example of how vulnerable investors can be to sudden reversals in market sentiment at a time of low, if erratically rising, interest rates and strong demand for income-generating investments.

</span>“Even for unconstrained bond funds, it’s rare for such a sharp decline,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA.

Mr. Gross gained a global following in part for making bold predictions on the markets—and placing outsize bets on those convictions. <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> as manager of the world’s largest bond fund at Pimco, he famously sold all of his U.S. Treasury holdings and used derivatives to place wagers against government-related bonds.</span> Those trades, among others, left Mr. Gross’s funds far more susceptible to wrong-way bets than his peers, former colleagues have said.

Slumping performance, client defections and a feud with some of his colleagues greased his exit from Pimco, a firm he co-founded decades earlier. He jumped <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 to</span> the smaller Janus Capital Group Inc., where the Unconstrained Bond Fund <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $2.08 billion</span>.

Mr. Rosenbluth said Mr. Gross may have been caught flat-footed during Tuesday’s selloff of Italian bonds. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He had argued that the yields on ultrasafe German bonds would rise, reflecting improving economic prospects throughout Europe and an increased willingness among investors to take on risk.

</span>Instead, the spread between yields on Italian and German 10-year bonds <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit 2.83 points</span> on Tuesday, widening <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2.05 on</span> Friday <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.57 in</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2018.</span>

The spread between Italian and German bonds was unchanged <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.828 points</span> on Wednesday, Thomson Reuters said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Stock benchmarks in Europe and the U.S. edged higher.

</span>Calls to a spokeswoman with Janus Henderson Group PLC, formed through <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 merger</span> between Janus and the U.K.’s Henderson Group, weren’t returned. Reached through a spokesman, Mr. Gross declined to comment.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s move on Sunday to block the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government has reignited fears that the continent’s third-largest economy would exit the currency union, a concern that rattled markets because any move to drop the euro or default on existing bonds could fuel significant losses among European lenders and impair economic growth.

</span>Mr. Gross’s Global Unconstrained Bond wasn’t the only mutual fund caught up in the selloff. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Managed-futures funds, which bet that market trends will continue, also fell sharply as one of those themes—rising U.S. interest rates—reversed course.

</span>AQR Capital Management’<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $10 billion</span> Managed Future Strategy, the biggest of the group, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 2.1% on</span> Tuesday on losses from its shorts, or bearish bets, on U.S. government-bond futures.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The LoCorr Market Trend Fund, another managed-futures fund, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">declined 2.2%,</span> while the Equinox Campbell Strategy Fund <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.51%.</span>

</span>Many traditional bond funds fared better.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Morningstar’s director of fixed-income manager research, Miriam Sjoblom, noted that the Pimco and DoubleLine ETFs are two of a breed of actively managed funds that rarely make the sort of esoteric bets that likely hurt Mr. Gross’s performance.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But even some ETFs with sizable allocations to Italian debt outperformed Mr. Gross.

</span>Italian bonds account <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20% of</span> the iShares International High Yield Bond ETF, which <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.7% on</span> Tuesday. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $11.8 billion</span> Vanguard Total International Bond ETF, which <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 8.3% of</span> its portfolio in Italian debt, slid <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 0.22%.</span>

</span>“In a diversified bond portfolio, where you had some Italy exposure, you generally held up OK,” Ms. Sjoblom said.

In his first-quarter letter, Mr. Gross said European investors had “piled into the region’s safe havens, namely German Bunds,” earlier this year after stocks declined sharply, Mr. Gross wrote. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">German bond yields, which had been on the rise as the nation’s economic picture improved, also plummeted, he said.

558,"<h3>The Former Afghan Central Bank Chief Says the Taliban Can’t Access Most of the Country’s Reserves</h3>Advertisement
The former Afghan central bank chief says the Taliban can’t access most of country’s reserves.
The former acting governor of the Afghan central bank, who has fled the country, said on Wednesday that nearly all of the bank’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $9 billion</span> in reserves were beyond the reach of the Taliban, who took over the country’s government over the weekend.
Ajmal Ahmady, who was appointed to the central bank just over a year ago, said nearly all the money was held overseas, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $7 billion</span> in assets by the Federal Reserve. In a series of Twitter posts, he added <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that $1.3 billion</span> in assets were held by other international accounts and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $700 million</span> were held by the Bank of International Settlements, which is based in Switzerland and acts as a bank for central banks.
“We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perhaps 0.1</span>-0.2 percent of Afghanistan’s total international reserves,” he wrote. “Not much.”
On Tuesday, a Biden administration official said access has been blocked to Afghan central bank reserves held in the United States. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">This action, which was taken by the Treasury Department, will put economic pressure on the Taliban as they seek to keep public services operating.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Separately on Tuesday, a group of lawmakers sent a letter to the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, urging her to intervene in the scheduled release <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $650 billion</span> in International Monetary Fund emergency reserves this month.</span> The allocation, of so-called special drawing rights, would potentially give Afghanistan and the Taliban access <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $450 million</span>.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, Mr. Ahmady wrote that Afghanistan was reliant on obtaining shipments of cash every few weeks because it had a large current account deficit.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(Afghanistan imports about five times more goods than it formally exports.)
</span>“The amount of such cash remaining is close to zero due a stoppage of shipments as the security situation deteriorated, especially during the last few days,” Mr. Ahmady wrote.
On Friday, the central banker received a call saying the country wouldn’t get further shipments of U.S. dollars, though the next one was supposed to arrive on Sunday. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Saturday, Afghan banks requested large amounts of dollars to keep up with customer withdrawals, but Mr. Ahmady said he had to limit the currency that could be sent to the banks to conserve the central bank’s supply.</span> He said it was the first time he made such a move.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Ahmady added that he told President Ashraf Ghani about the currency shipments being canceled and that the Afghan president then spoke with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.</span> Though he said the shipments were approved “in principle,” they never arrived the next day.
“Please note that in no way were Afghanistan’s international reserves ever compromised,” he wrote.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Without access to these reserves, Mr. Ahmady wrote, the Taliban will probably have to put capital controls in place and limit access to dollars, beginning a cycle in which the national currency, known as the afghani, will depreciate and inflation will rise rapidly.</span> On Tuesday, the afghani reached a record low <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 85.4 to</span> the U.S. dollar, but appreciated <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 percent</span> on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data.

New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait: '12 gallons of milk a week may sound like a lot, but they've actually had to cut out their milk baths on alternate days'
A large family featured on CNN discussing the rising costs of basic groceries like milk was mocked by some progressive media figures on Thursday.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">To demonstrate the ""squeeze"" of inflation and supply chain issues on everyday Americans, CNN's ""New Day"" featured the Stotlers, a Texas couple looking after nine children – two of whom are their biological kids, while they've adopted six more and have one foster child.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Krista Stotler said she started seeing prices rising this summer and it was costing them an <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra $100 a</span> week on groceries.

FOX NEWS POLL: <span id=""3"" class=""red"">HIGH VOTER WORRY ON INFLATION AS BIDEN ECONOMY RATINGS PLUMMET
Liberals jumped on the segment and appeared to mock the family's concerns.
</span>""12 gallons of milk a week may sound like a lot, but they've actually had to cut out their milk baths on alternate days,"" snarked New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait.
The New York Times account on crossword puzzles also got into the act, tweeting – and deleting –, ""sorry, i can't do today's crossword. i'm too busy carrying <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">my 12 gallons</span> of milk home.""
CNN anchor Brianna Keilar's tweet of the segment got thousands of responses, many of them from left-wing accounts mocking the family for buying that much milk. Some didn't appear to realize the size of their family, which was only apparent from watching the segment.
""Nobody mentioning that she thought PF Chang's was the healthy stuff,"" joked Rex Chapman, a left-wing Twitter personality.
""Who <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buys 48 gallons</span> a month?"" Daily Beast contributing editor Goldie Taylor wondered.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">GROCERY STORE SHOPPERS SOUND OFF ON SURGING PRICES
Other reporters and pundits dinged CNN for the segment, with some saying they couldn't be right about milk being that cheap earlier this year and the family wasn't indicative of a typical American household.</span> It's unclear what average grocery costs have been in the Stotler's Dallas-area town.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS WAGES RISING FASTER THAN INFLATION
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">""It’s certainly possible that the Stotlers got a gallon of milk <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.99 at</span> some point on sale, and <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $2.79 price</span> as of today is what a gallon of Kroger-<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">brand 2 percent</span> milk costs at the Texas store shown in the CNN clip, according to Kroger’s website,"" Vice reported, while arguing it wasn't due to crisis inflation levels.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""The Stotlers may be wrong about the significance of random milk price fluctuations, but their angst over inflation and the general state of the economy is shared by millions of other Americans.</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">""
Evan McMorris-Santoro, the CNN correspondent who interviewed the family, blasted critics of the piece, saying it was remarkable how many were trying to ""dunk on a charming family who lays out how it feels to shop with price rises.</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">""
""Glad you're all weathering the economy so well!""</span> he wrote.

Instead, we live differently here: with meager lawns (if we have any at all), common stoops, shared walls (or ceilings), and echoes of our neighbors' dubious TV choices.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The District is a city of row homes and modest apartments, which makes the feel of the place — and your housing options here — significantly different from what you'd find in New York or Chicago or Kansas City.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The above chart, based on <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">new 2014 American</span> Community Survey data on the characteristics of occupied housing, breaks down these differences.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A quarter of all housing in DC is in rowhomes.</span> One-third, as <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014,</span> was in large apartment buildings <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 units</span> or more, a share that will no doubt grow as new apartments emerge downtown and in Southeast.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Half of the occupied housing in Baltimore, in contrast, is in row homes (a whole lot of the unoccupied housing there is, too).</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Nearly half of the housing in New York is in large apartments.</span> Detroit, a spread-out city now struggling mightily to shrink with grace, has vast stretches of single-family homes on par with newer car-centric cities in the South and West.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">These figures tell us not just about the physical character of each city, but the potential they have for new housing as many places (Detroit not withstanding) look for space to fit a growing urban population.</span> Higher density, in all of these cities, doesn't have to mean Manhattan-style mega-rises.
A parcel of land that has traditionally been zoned for a single-family home could fit several rowhouses. A hundred-year-old rowhouse — as Washington has witnessed — can become a three- or four-unit condo. A stretch of land that fits several houses can also accommodate a modest-scale apartment building fitting three times as many families.
As this chart shows, there are a lot of options between the traditional single-family home and the tower. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">And there are few cities in America — including those with conspicuously rising housing costs — that don't have room in the mix for more of them.

Coronavirus collides with Latin America’s maid culture — with sometimes deadly results
RIO DE JANEIRO — Every weekday morning <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 years</span>, housekeeper Bety Santos has left her Rio favela to take a crowded bus to the wealthy seaside district of Barra da Tijuca. But the family she serves there now frightens her.
It’s the rich — those who can afford to travel or study abroad — who brought the novel coronavirus to Latin America. But it’s the poor, she believes, who will pay.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Her employer, a 71-year-old physician, returned from Paris recently with a cold.</span> Though she tested negative for the coronavirus, Santos, who cooks and cleans for the family, can’t shake her anxiety — or her mounting annoyance. Governments are urging social isolation. Officials have asked the upper classes to put their maids on paid leave. But she’s still working.
“They cannot survive without me,” said Santos,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48.</span> “They depend on me for everything. ‘I lost my glasses: Do you know where they are?’ ‘Next to the bed.’ ‘Where is the control for the TV?’ ‘Over there.’ <span id=""4"" class=""red"">I am scared of catching it from [my boss], but it’s not an option for me to be unemployed right now.</span> I am a worker.”
As the coronavirus moves deeper into Latin America, analysts expect the region’s everyday structural inequities to accelerate the spread of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Imported by the wealthy, the virus is now reaching into impoverished communities, at times through domestic employment, infecting people with fewer resources to combat the disease — with sometimes deadly results.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Rio’s first death was a maid who is believed to have caught it from her employer.

EasyJet, the British budget airline that grew to become one of Europe’s largest carriers, announced Monday that it would ground all of its planes due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
</span>“As a result of the unprecedented travel restrictions imposed by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the implementation of national lockdowns across many European countries, easyJet has, today, fully grounded its entire fleet of aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement carried by ITV News.
“At this stage there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">We will continuously evaluate the situation based on regulations and demand, and will update the market when we have a view.</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">""
Airlines around the world have faced a collapse in demand and increasing government restrictions on where they can fly.</span> EasyJet has called on the British government to step in with loans to aid ailing airlines.
EasyJet had announced last week that it would be suspending most of its flights. Many of the flights that went ahead served to repatriate customers stuck abroad.
More <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 300 planes</span> will be grounded under the current plan. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Cabin crew on grounded flights will be furloughed for two months <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 80 percent</span> of their salary under the British government’s job retention program.
</span>Saudi deaths from coronavirus double as overall cases <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 1,299
DUBAI</span> — The number of fatalities from the covid-19 disease in Saudi Arabia doubled to eight while cases increased <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 96 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,299,</span> authorities announced on Sunday night.
After nearby Iran, Saudi Arabia is the worst hit in the region by the coronavirus pandemic with the steepest rate of increase of any of its neighbors.
The Red Sea port city of Jiddah was also locked down on Sunday, with a curfew starting <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 p</span>.m. and all entrance and exit from the province barred. The holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the capital Riyadh were similarly locked down on Thursday, while the local outbreak epicenter of Qatif, in the east, was closed the week before.
The suspension of all public transportation as well as domestic and international flights in the country has also been extended until further notice.
Less than a third of the new cases were linked to travel, according to the Health Ministry, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 68 of</span> them traced to transmission from the infected already inside the kingdom.
Neighboring United Arab Emirates also reported a jump of cases late Sunday, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 102 new</span> cases, bringing the national total <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 570,</span> and another death for a total of three in the country. The highest percentage of cases in the country are between the ages of 20-44, reflecting the demographics in the UAE where <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 90 percent</span> of the population are foreign-born.
The UAE also announced it was setting up new drive-in testing centers across the country to boost testing which the Ministry of Health said was already the second highest per capital in the world <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 220,000 tests</span> conducted for a population of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 9 million</span>.
Florida checkpoint shut down after causing massive traffic jam on I-95
An attempt to screen out-of-state drivers entering Florida backfired on Sunday when <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 95 came</span> to a standstill, creating miles of traffic near the Georgia border.

The</span></span> Florida Department of Transportation erected a checkpoint on the heavily traveled highway around noon on Sunday, citing an executive order from Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) that requires visitors from hotspots like New York to self-isolate for two weeks upon arriving in Florida. Officials told the Florida Times-Union that all drivers, except for those in commercial vehicles, would have to stop and provide their contact information and details about their trip.

Within a matter of hours, though, long lines of cars and trucks stretched past the state border and into Georgia. The checkpoint was shut down for four hours to give traffic a chance to clear up, WJXT reported. It later reopened at around 5:15 p.m., once the slowdowns had subsided and traffic cones had been adjusted to allow for a better flow of vehicles.

Australia’s government plans to subsidize the wages of private-sector employees for up to six months to help businesses and workers struggling with the impact of the coronavirus shutdown.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">“We will pay employers to pay their employees,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday, as he announced what he dubbed a “job keeper"" program.</span> “Our government has made a decision today ... that no government has made before in Australia.”
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">The payment will be a flat rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,500 Australian</span> dollars — more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $920 </span>— every two weeks, Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters, with any firm that has suffered <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 30 percent</span> decline in revenue able to take part.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Businesses would be required to keep each subsidized worker employed to take part in the program, which the Australian government said was part of <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $80 billion</span> package to support the wages of up to six million Australians for six months.

</span>Brazil opens stadiums, including the Maracanã, for coronavirus victims
Brazil has found new use for several of the stadiums it built and renovated in preparation for <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2014 World</span> Cup. Local governments plan to convert the venues into hospitals and vaccine centers for what is expected to be a surge of novel coronavirus cases.
The country’s most famous stadium, the iconic Maracanã sports complex in Rio de Janeiro, will become a temporary hospital. The Maracanã stadium held the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Summer</span> Olympics and is among the best-known soccer stadiums in the world. It first was used for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1950 World</span> Cup, and authorities have not decided how many beds it will hold or whether they will be placed on the playing field or elsewhere in a complex that also houses a track and field stadium and an aquatic park.

Bolsonaro told reporters last week that he believes Brazilians are protected by natural immunity.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A pro-Trump community in Florida sits at nexus of debate over reopening economy
FORT MYERS, Fla. — Hours after her father died, an angry and distraught Lori Hannaford typed out <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3 a</span>.m.</span> Facebook post aimed at anyone still walking around this laid-back city as if the world wasn't reeling from a pandemic caused by a deadly virus with no vaccine and no cure.
“I hope you never have to lose a spouse and be unable to touch them, be in their room, or say goodbye to them,” she wrote, a short time after changing her Facebook cover photo to a picture of her stepfather kissing her on her wedding day. “I hope you never have to lose your father and be unable to hug your mom and be consoled because you have to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">stay 6 feet</span> away.”
Before New York hospitals were flooded with coronavirus cases and Florida <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 3,000 cases</span>, this tourist haven near the Gulf of Mexico was the first city on the Eastern Seaboard to report a death from the virus, a woman who had traveled overseas and died on <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 5.</span> Hannaford’s stepfather, John Gness, was the virus’s second victim here, succumbing to a fatal combination of covid-19 and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had battled for the final years of his life.
The pandemic-related deaths jolted a region that boasts low crime, paradise-like weather <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 50 miles</span> of white-sand beaches — a year-round vacation destination that city leaders admit can feel immune to the problems that plague other places.
Now, weeks into the crisis, Fort Myers sits at the emotional nexus of a growing — and increasingly politicized — national debate over what to do next.
Popular Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies of coronavirus
TOKYO — Veteran Japanese slapstick comedian Ken Shimura has died after contracting the new coronavirus, local media reported on Monday, marking the first high-profile death in the country since the outbreak began.
Shimura,<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70,</span> was a member of a Japanese comedy band The Drifters (not to be confused with the American R&B group) and starred in the group’s prime-time television comedy show “Hachijidayo Zeninshugo!” (“It’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8 o</span>’clock, gather round everyone!“) that was popular with children but not so much with parents.
The TV show, launched <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1969,</span> has one of the highest ratings in Japanese television history.
Shimura, who said in his memoir that he drew inspiration from Jerry Lewis, “captured the hearts of all generations with his penchant for funny faces and ability to deliver jokes as if they were unscripted,” Kyodo News reported, noting sketches such as the “mustache dance” and characters such as the “stupid lord” and “strange uncle.”
Before Shimura joined the band, the Drifters were famous for a very brief opening act at the Beatles first concert in Japan <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1966.</span>
Shimura, who was still working in television when he fell ill, was hospitalized on <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 20 after</span> developing a fever and was
diagnosed with severe pneumonia, Kyodo reported. He tested positive for the virus on <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 23.</span>
FDA approves unlimited use of Battelle mask-sterilizing technology after lobbying from DeWine, Trump
Battelle has received full emergency authorization to sterilize N95 face masks so that they can be re-used, the Food and Drug Administration announced late Sunday.
The decision followed a weekend of intense lobbying by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), who previously criticized the FDA for putting limits on the use of the new technology.
Battelle, a Columbus, Ohio-based nonprofit, says that its decontamination system is capable of sanitizing up <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80,000 respirator</span> masks per day. Initially, however, the FDA issued only a partial waiver of its usual rules, which restricted Battelle to <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cleaning 10,000 masks</span> per day.
DeWine slammed that decision in a Sunday morning news release, calling it “reckless,"" and Ohio’s attorney general threatened to sue. Later on Sunday, President Trump said that after speaking with DeWine, he had contacted the head of the FDA to see if the limitations could be removed.
I have just talked with @realDonaldTrump about this issue, and we had a good conversation. He understands the problem and says he will do everything he can to get this approved today. Thank you, @POTUS. https://t.co/iha2F2AXgv— Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span></span></span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020
The</span></span> FDA revised its stance late Sunday night, saying that it will no longer be putting a limit on how many masks can be sanitized in a given day. In a news release, DeWine’s office said that Battelle plans to ship its machines to New York and Washington state, in addition to using them in Ohio.
“We‘re grateful that the President and the FDA moved quickly to help us get this solution back up and running,” said a statement from Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. “This Ohio-driven solution has the potential to save lives now and in the future across the United States.”
China’s Xi seen in public for first time during outbreak without face mask, party media says
In a photo released by Xinhua on Sun, President #XiJinping was seen, for the first time, inspecting a public place without a face mask since the onset of the outbreak. He was seen adhering to health protocols by maintaining a distance from others on a dock. pic.twitter.com/Q7DrRIkUFS— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 30,</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020
Chinese</span> leader Xi Jinping appeared in public without a face mask for the first time since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in the country, Chinese media stated on Monday.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the ruling Communist Party, shared a photograph of Xi with a bare face from a visit on Sunday to the Ningbo-Zhoushan port in Zhejiang Province.
Other photographs from the visit published by state-run Xinhua News Agency show Xi and others accompanying him wearing masks.
Though the World Health Organization and other health organizations have advised against the wearing of surgical masks in most circumstances, Xi has been seen repeatedly wearing one in public. When the Chinese president visited the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, on <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 10,</span> he wore a mask and spoke to patients via video link.
China has been announcing consistently low numbers of new cases. There were <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 new</span> cases on Sunday, according to official figures, and none in Hubei, the province that was at the heart of the outbreak, for the sixth day. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Though the Chinese government has pushed the country to resume economic activity, some experts worry that the figures may mask a lingering outbreak in the country.
</span>De Blasio says New Yorkers can be <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fined $500 if</span> they defy orders to break up gatherings
New Yorkers who defy police orders when told to break up gatherings can be fined up <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to<span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $500,</span></span> New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) told reporters on Sunday.
Gatherings of any size are prohibited in New York state, and the New York Police Department has been authorized to issue summonses and fines at parks, playgrounds and places of worship where people ignore social distancing regulations and refuse to disperse, De Blasio said. Those fines can range from $250 <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to<span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $500,</span></span> and will also apply to people who return to gatherings after being told to leave.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">De Blasio emphasized that the penalty would be only used as a last resort, saying that he didn’t want to fine people “when so many folks are going through economic distress.”</span> But, he added, “if they haven’t gotten the message by now, and they don’t get the message when an enforcement officer’s staring them in the face [...] that person then deserves the fine.”
“You’ve been warned and warned again,” De Blasio said.
South Korea <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">announces 78 new</span> cases as concerns grow about clusters in Seoul
South Korea <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">announced 78 new</span> cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday, along with six deaths, according to an announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
The country has seen a steady rate of new cases for almost two weeks, with <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 100 new</span> cases each day since <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 11.</span> The total number of deaths from the country’s outbreak <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 158 so</span> far.
However, concerns grew that greater Seoul, the country’s bustling capital and its sprawling satellite towns, had become new hub for the outbreak.
New infections reported in Seoul and neighboring Gyeonggi Province and Incheon came <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 31,</span> surpassing the number found in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, earlier epicenters of the Korean outbreak.
The outbreaks in the Seoul region have been linked to a call center and a church that held services in violation of the government’s social distancing policy.
Andrew Cuomo during the covid-19 crisis is the same as ever, with one big difference: People like him
One odd side effect of covid-19 has been what it does to taste. Even those who have avoided the illness enjoy things they once disliked: Government spending. Facetiming with family.
Andrew M. Cuomo.
The governor of New York’s morning news conferences have become part of the country’s new daily rhythm. And to the surprise of anyone who has watched his State of the State, it’s must-see television.
First come the facts. In a matter of days, there are no cases, <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 30,000 cases</span>, then <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 cases</span> in New York state. “That’s a problem,” he says. They are running out of beds and ventilators. He doesn’t shy away from that. “That’s a challenge.” He pauses.
“Take a breath,” he says, and when he starts to talk again it is the revival portion of the meeting. There are moving stories about New York, his mother, his father and all of humanity. The density of the state — its “closeness,” he says — is its vulnerability in this moment. But it is also what will get it through. He is talking to New York but the whole country is listening to the Cuomo Monologues: part briefing, part sermon, part inspirational talk.
The coronavirus crisis has reintroduced the nation to a different cast of Democratic leaders. Former vice president Joe Biden — the supposed standard-bearer of the party — has been largely missing, as governors like Jay Inslee of Washington state, Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan find the spotlight. And no one is on a bigger stage right now than Cuomo.
Analysis: Trump beats a retreat on opening the country as coronavirus data, images show dark reality
For six days straight, President Trump talked about reopening the country quickly. He wanted people filing into offices again, diners returning to restaurants and shoppers gathering at malls without fear of contagion.
Trump mused about a reopening date of <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 12,</span> picking it arbitrarily because he thought it would be beautiful to see church pews packed with parishioners on Easter. Then he dug in, seeming to tune out the nearly unanimous assessment of public health experts and governors and mayors fighting to help save lives, which was that Easter would be far too soon because the worst still was yet to come. As the self-described wartime president saw things, the novel coronavirus was a “silent enemy” and America was defeating it.
What a difference a week makes.
Trump beat a hasty retreat on Sunday, announcing from the Rose Garden just before dusk that the federal government’s stringent social distancing guidelines, set to expire on Monday, would be extended through <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 30.</span></span>
Japan uses targeted coronavirus testing; South Korea goes big. The U.S. faces a choice.
TOKYO — In East Asia, two rivals are grappling with the coronavirus pandemic in very different ways: mass testing versus targeted testing.
It's a debate over tactics that has profound implications in the United States and elsewhere, as health officials struggle to find the best methods to track and contain the virus.
South Korea has won global praise for swiftly making coronavirus tests widely available and has already tested more <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 394,000 people</span>. It has <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 9,583 infected</span> people.
Japan, a country whose population of <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 127 million</span> is more than twice that of South Korea, has conducted more <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 48,000 tests</span> on <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 28,000 people</span> and <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 1,724 cases</span>.
For weeks, Japan has been gripped with a debate. Is the country seeing fewer infections than South Korea simply because it is testing fewer people? Is the Japanese government marshaling its resources wisely, or burying its head in the sand?
As in the United States, Japan’s government was criticized in the early weeks of the outbreak for failing to expand its testing capacity.
Japan has since expanded testing capacity, but the Japanese Medical Association said it has <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">identified 290 examples</span> in which doctors requested tests for sick people but were unable to obtain them.
As Trump declared coronavirus under control, local leaders faced confusion and chaos as cases piled up
As a mysterious respiratory illness tore through China and other countries in mid-January, Kyle Coleman, an emergency management coordinator in Texas, took inventory of his team’s personal protective gear at a warehouse in Bexar County.
The hazmat suits and gloves were in good condition. Some of the respirator masks had expired. Three pallets of hand sanitizer seemed like enough because they seldom used more than one pallet a year.
Over several weeks in January, Coleman followed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus: the first death reported in China on Jan.<span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> the spread to Thailand and Japan, and then the first U.S. case in Washington state confirmed on Jan.<span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span>
The next day, President Trump, in an interview on CNBC, assured the public: “We have it totally under control.”
But Coleman thought it was only a matter of time before it arrived in Bexar County, home to <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 million</span> residents, including those in the city of San Antonio. So on Jan.<span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Coleman purchased <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 25,000 respirator</span> masks.
“You would read one story one day, and then you get another story the next day, and it wasn’t the same message coming out,” Coleman said. “But it kind of looked like it was bad, so we started ordering supplies.”

WASHINGTON—When a business-school student sought out Jerome Powell several years ago for career advice, Mr. Powell, President Donald Trump’s pick to become the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered his philosophy on getting ahead.

</span>His advice: Keep your head down and work hard, according to the student, Sean Gillispie, today a software product director in the Washington area. Mr. Powell told him he would be surprised “how many otherwise competent people self-sabotage with poor behavior,” Mr. Gillispie recalls.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">In recent years, there have been two kinds of Fed chairmen: commanding personalities such as Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, whose views on inflation and interest rates dominated central banking from the 1980s through the mid-2000s; and the consensus-driven leaders, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who guided the central bank toward more open decision-making and de-emphasized the power of the chairman.

</span>Mr. Powell, judging by his nearly 40-year career in government, law and banking, is likely to be in the latter group. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">That means a Powell Fed might look a lot like it has since Mr. Greenspan retired <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such continuity would be welcome in the markets, which don’t like uncertainty, and at the Fed, one of the world’s most powerful economic policy-making bodies.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">It also could please Mr. Trump, who has spoken approvingly of record stock prices and declining unemployment.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">His appointment could also cause friction within the Republican Party, where many rank-and-file members want to see the Fed roll back a decade of central-bank activism sparked by the financial crisis.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In the weeks leading up to the selection, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said he thought the Fed should “move in a different direction.”

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The president opted against offering the job to two candidates more popular with the Republican establishment—former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor—after advisers raised concerns that their past support for higher interest rates could unsettle Wall Street, according to two people familiar with the deliberations.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“I would be surprised if [Mr. Powell] walked away at the end of his term with a huge stamp of reshaping the Fed,” says Charles Plosser, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2015 worked</span> closely with Mr. Powell.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“He’s not likely to lead Federal Reserve reform and innovation on monetary policy, but that does not mean he won’t be a good chair.”

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Unlike Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Powell doesn’t hold a degree in economics—which would make him the first chairman since the late 1970s without such a credential.</span> Although he has worked as an investor, lawyer and bank regulator, he has no experience leading a large organization.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Because Mr. Powell isn’t an economist, he might be more likely to rely on Fed economists.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">He also might be less dug in and more flexible than Ph.D.s on some intense economics debates, such as whether low unemployment is a precursor to rising inflation.

</span>Mr. Powell, who is known as Jay, declined to comment for this article.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Fed is no simple bureaucracy.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">It has a seven-member board,<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 regional</span> banks, a secretive decision-making process and<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span>700 employees involved in interest-rate decisions, bank regulation and managing the nation’s currency circulation.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">It also serves as the Treasury’s fiscal agent in managing the nation’s debt.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">It is in the process of raising short-term interest rates from near-zero levels and of gradually winding down <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $4.2 trillion</span> portfolio of mortgage and Treasury securities built up during and after the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell was part of a group <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 that</span> pressed Mr. Bernanke to wind down the bond-purchase programs, although he has never dissented <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 44 meetings</span> on the Fed board.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s most notable mark on monetary policy at the Fed was his involvement in bond-buying phase out.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Worried that investors believed the programs would continue indefinitely, he joined with two other Fed governors, Betsy Duke and Jeremy Stein, to persuade Mr. Bernanke to scale the program back.</span> The effort was typical of Mr. Powell’s style—conducted almost entirely behind the scenes and with little fanfare.

The initial effort was rocky. Bond investors grew frightened, sparking a selloff known in markets as the “taper tantrum.” <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But they eventually settled and the Fed is now gradually reducing its portfolio.</span> Mr. Powell later conceded that his concerns about continuing the programs were overblown.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s views on economic and monetary policy sync up with Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He has supported a slightly lighter touch on financial regulation but hasn’t backed wholesale efforts to dismantle overhauls implemented following <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">In testimony before lawmakers this summer, he said those rules made the financial system “substantially stronger and more stable.”

</span>“Jay is certainly not going to change course in any radical way, but he’s very smart. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">He will react to whatever shifts are out there,” says Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and an occasional adviser to Republican presidential candidates, who has known Mr. Powell <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>.

</span>A Washington native, Mr. Powell,<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 64 years</span> old, grew up the second of six children in suburban Chevy Chase, Md., where he still lives. His father was a lawyer; his mother worked part time for the Republican National Committee.

Like his father, he attended the Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit high school. His parents were active in civic and charitable causes, many centered around their church. Mr. Powell also has served on the boards of educational and environmental groups.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Matthew McCormick, an economist who has worked for several federal agencies, recalls seeing Mr. Powell last year carrying a car seat and luggage for someone else’s family trying to make a tight connection at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va.

</span>Mr. Powell has a somewhat conventional Washington résumé. He went to Princeton University and Georgetown Law School. He worked for several years as a lawyer in New York before joining investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. <span id=""31"" class=""red""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> he returned to Washington to become assistant secretary for domestic finance in President George H.W. Bush’s Treasury Department, following the bank’s former chairman, Nicholas Brady, who was Treasury secretary.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">He later was promoted to undersecretary for domestic finance, charged with untangling a wave of bank failures.

</span>One Sunday morning in <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 1991,</span> Mr. Powell joined other regulators in a conference room to hash out how to deal with the collapse of the Bank of New England, at the time one of the region’s largest banks. To prevent a bank run, the group decided to guarantee all deposits, no matter how large they were, Mr. Powell recalled in <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2013 speech</span>.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Later that year, Mr. Powell helmed the government’s response to the Treasury auction bid-rigging scandal by Salomon Brothers, a major investment bank.</span> Mr. Powell ironed out an agreement that imposed severe penalties against the bank, which had admitted making unauthorized bids, without forcing it into bankruptcy, and arranged for investor Warren Buffett to become the firm’s chairman.

<span id=""34"" class=""red"">“It was a very ticklish, tricky thing, and it was exceptionally well handled at the end,” says John Dugan, who served under Mr. Powell at Treasury.

</span>The episodes of the early 1990s, which showed Mr. Powell to be relatively pragmatic, shaped his regulatory worldview, says Mr. Dugan. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">“He understands there’s a role for regulation, and he’s not at one extreme or the other,” says Mr. Dugan, who was U.S. comptroller of the currency <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2005 to</span><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010.</span>

</span>After Mr. Bush left office, Mr. Powell returned to banking in New York. <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1997,</span> he moved back to Washington and joined the Carlyle Group, a private-equity investment firm, where he founded and led the firm’s industrial group within its U.S. buyout fund. It was lucrative work. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">In financial disclosures earlier this year, Mr. Powell, who drives a Tesla, reported assets worth <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $19.7 million</span> <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $55 million</span>.

</span>After nearly two decades in the private sector, colleagues say, Mr. Powell was eager to return to public service but wasn’t sure how or where to make his mark. He went to work at the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center, where he didn’t draw a salary.

<span id=""37"" class=""red"">“This was getting his feet back into the water and figuring out where he wanted to get engaged,” says Shai Akabas, an economist at the center who worked closely with Mr. Powell.

</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">He landed at the Fed almost by accident.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">In a closed-door meeting with House Republicans in <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2011,</span> he challenged his own party over its standoff with President Barack Obama about authorizing an increase in the national-debt ceiling.</span> He warned Republican lawmakers about the harm that would fall on retirees, veterans and other Americans if Congress didn’t authorize an increase in government borrowing, according to two people who attended.

<span id=""40"" class=""red"">Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner heard about his take-your-medicine stand and asked colleagues if Mr. Powell might solve another problem they were having, according to several people involved in the deliberations.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">The administration had been unable to get Senate Republicans to confirm its pick for a vacancy on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, and officials were struggling to come up with names of a Republican who might help break the impasse.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Impressed after their meetings with Mr. Powell, officials in the White House recommended his nomination for the job.</span> The Senate confirmed his nomination <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> and he was reappointed two years later.

Many Republicans weren’t thrilled, <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 voting</span> against him <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 and</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 voting</span> against him <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>

<span id=""43"" class=""red"">Some GOP lawmakers have been ruffled by Mr. Powell’s unwillingness to publicly criticize the Fed’s regulatory agenda, which included implementing substantial provisions of <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Dodd</span>-Frank Act.

</span>That reluctance “just left some people flat,” says Rep. French Hill (R., Ark.), who remains friends with Mr. Powell after they worked together in the Bush administration during the early 1990s.

Mr. Hill says he can understand why some colleagues wish Mr. Powell had been more outspoken, but adds it isn’t Mr. Powell’s style to air his concerns publicly. “It’s not fair to assume what Jay Powell said or didn’t say in private,” he says. “He kept those views to himself.”

<span id=""44"" class=""red"">One person who has worked with several Fed officials in recent years says he often heard about petty personal rivalries or feuds between board members, but these people never had a bad word for Mr. Powell.

</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">“He is remarkably undogmatic,” says Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University economics professor, Democrat and former Fed governor whose office was adjacent to Mr. Powell’s.</span> “He listens more than he talks.”

Mr. Powell has held several different roles on a board that has been plagued with vacancies in several years. He earned respect from colleagues for tackling unheralded operational tasks and technical issues, including managing payment-processing systems. He also boosted morale this summer when he oversaw the implementation of a relaxed summer dress code.

10692,"<h3>For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap</h3>WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”
What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.
But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.
</span>As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 landing</span>, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1969,</span> almost six years after his death.
[Remembering <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 in</span> a New York Times special section.]
The presidents who followed Kennedy accomplished remarkable things in space, including the development of the reusable space shuttle, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and its offspring, the robot exploration of the solar system and the construction of the International Space Station along with Russia and other partners. Yet none of it ever fired the national imagination as did humans traveling to other worlds.
“There was a time when science and space exploration just captured the soul of America,” said Douglas Brinkley, the presidential historian at Rice University and author of “American Moonshot,” a new book on Mr. Kennedy and the space race. “The problem is it’s easy to say, ‘Let’s go back to the moon and to Mars,’ but as they used to say in NASA — ‘No bucks, no Buck Rogers.’”
Indeed, other presidents never made it the priority Kennedy did, regardless of their sweeping words. “The key factor is they’re not willing to pay for it,” said John M. Logsdon, a prominent space historian and professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “Kennedy not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. None of the presidents since then have been willing to do anything like that.”
Advocates of space exploration hope Mr. Trump will succeed with his moon program, called Artemis, for the mythical Apollo’s goddess sister, if for no other reason than his relentlessness when he applies himself to a project or a cause. Being the president who returned humanity to the moon on the way to Mars would be the sort of splashy, high-profile spectacle that excites him.
Mr. Trump hosted Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and the family of Neil Armstrong on Friday in the Oval Office to mark what the president called “one of the great achievements ever.” Vice President Mike Pence, who heads a reconstituted National Space Council, plans to visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.
“NASA is back,” Mr. Trump boasted.
The hurdles, however, remain sky-high. Mr. Pence told NASA in March to accelerate its schedule to reach the moon <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2024,</span> the end of Mr. Trump’s second term if he wins re-election. NASA shook up its management to meet that goal. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But Congress has shown less interest in financing it, and the technical obstacles to such a timetable remain formidable.
</span>Mr. Kranz himself highlighted the challenge in an appearance this week at Purdue University, saying the national environment had changed. “Today, you have this marvelous technology — the books have been written, the kids are educated,” he said. “What we need is leadership that says, ‘Let’s go,’ and then you need unity within the nation that’s going to make it happen.”
Kennedy was “not that interested in space.” He was keen to compete.
Kennedy’s moon mission was born not out of the explorer spirit but a desperation to catch up in a space race the United States was losing. The Soviets had beaten the Americans by launching the first satellite into orbit <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1957 and</span>, just three months after Kennedy’s inauguration <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1961,</span> the first man. In a memo a week later, Kennedy demanded any space initiative that “promises dramatic results in which we could win.”
The answer was the moon. Six weeks after Yuri Gagarin’s orbit, Kennedy addressed Congress to set a goal, “before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” He followed up a year later in a landmark speech at Rice University: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”
For Kennedy, it was all about Cold War competition. “I’m not that interested in space,” he told his NASA administrator in a private meeting, where he made clear that space priorities other than a lunar landing meant little to him — as did arriving on the moon second.
Because of an assassin’s bullet, though, it fell to his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson — who unlike Kennedy was genuinely invested in space — to build the moon program into what it would be. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While the space project enjoyed only shallow public support given its cost, the assassination made it a moral imperative to fulfill the martyred leader’s vision.
</span>But it would be their mutual rival, Richard M. Nixon, who would preside over the actual landing on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 20,</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1969.</span> Nixon relished making what he called the “most historic phone call ever made from the White House” to speak with Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin on the moon. But beyond that, Nixon was not especially engaged in the space program, which was seen as a Kennedy legacy.
In <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 1970,</span> less than a year after the first landing, Nixon signed a directive making space just another program that would compete for funding along with every other, the turning point to Mr. Logsdon. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As interest and television ratings for subsequent Apollo launches dwindled, the final three moon missions were scrapped, ending the program with <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 17 in</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1972.</span>
</span>Nixon did authorize the development of the space shuttle, the principal path to space for Americans for decades to come, and he sealed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union that would lead to the docking of Apollo and Soyuz capsules in orbit <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1975 under</span> his successor, Gerald R. Ford.
But the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, while momentous geopolitically, also effectively ended the space race. If astronauts and cosmonauts could meet in space, there hardly seemed an urgent need to spend huge amounts of money on an antiquated competition. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">At its peak, NASA commanded more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4 percent</span> of the federal budget; today it receives about half <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1 percent</span>.

Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.
“None of the administrations since Johnson were facing a proposition that what hung in the balance here was nothing less than the beginning of the end of the Cold War,” said Sean O’Keefe, a NASA administrator under George W. Bush. “This was a very dominant theme.”
Story Musgrave, a retired astronaut who flew six shuttle missions, said the original rationale for the space program proved to be its inescapable burden. “The trouble if you make it about winning is that when you win, you may not have” a reason to continue, he said. “Kennedy really did set us up for the total lack of vision that occurred after ’69 because we won.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Presidential visions are undone by financial realities.
</span>After a six-year hiatus, Americans returned to space <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981 with</span> the launch of the space shuttle Columbia only three months after Ronald Reagan took office.
Reagan embraced the program as a symbol of American optimism and ambition and, echoing Kennedy, announced to Congress <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 that</span> he was directing NASA to build a permanently manned space station “and to do it within a decade.”
But Reagan was most remembered for his moving speech after the Challenger blew up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1986,</span> killing all seven on board, including the teacher Christa McAuliffe. “Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue,” he told a television audience, concluding with a tribute to the crew. “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.”
Hoping to reinvigorate the program, President George Bush announced on the 20th anniversary of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11,</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> an initiative to return to the moon and then to go to Mars. “Why the moon? Why Mars?” Bush asked. “Because it is humanity’s destiny to strive, to seek, to find. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And because it is America’s destiny to lead.”
Mr. Logsdon, the historian, who has written several books on presidents and the space program — most recently one on Reagan, published this year — said Bush came the closest any president has come to matching Kennedy’s vision and budget commitment, but the price tag caused sticker shock in Congress, and the idea went nowhere.
</span>When Bill Clinton took office, he revamped the program. “We had concluded that there was little point in putting astronauts on the moon again” unless it was done with a crewed base, recalled John Holdren, his science adviser. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But as before, the estimated cost was enormous.</span> “We saw no prospect of such a sum materializing.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Instead, Mr. Clinton cut NASA’s budget and reimagined the program as a vehicle for international cooperation, converting Reagan’s envisioned space station into a joint venture with Russia as it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union.</span> By the time Mr. Clinton left office, Americans and Russians were living together on the International Space Station, and have since.
George W. Bush found himself repeating history. Like Reagan, it fell to him to pick NASA back up after a shuttle disaster when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> killing all seven on board. A year later, Mr. Bush set in motion plans to retire the aging shuttles in favor of a new set of powerful rockets and a crew capsule.
And like his father, Mr. Bush aimed to return to the moon <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020,</span> followed by a mission to Mars. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But even though Congress signed on and financed the start of the program, impatient politicians gave up when progress was slower and costlier than predicted.
</span>Trump sends mixed signals about his moon plan.
Barack Obama seemed less interested in space and killed Mr. Bush’s Constellation program to build the Ares rockets and Orion capsule even after it had begun test launches, calling instead for outsourcing manned spaceflight to commercial companies. As a result, since the shuttles were retired <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> Americans have had to rely on paid rides to the space station on Russian rockets.
Mr. Obama saw no need to return to the moon, proposing instead to land astronauts on an asteroid <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> then send them to Mars in the 2030s. Congressional Republicans scoffed and rejected the idea.
Mr. Trump came to office determined to reverse course, re-establishing the National Space Council abolished by Mr. Clinton. The president has relished surrounding himself with Apollo-era heroes like Mr. Kranz, Mr. Aldrin and the moonwalker Harrison H. Schmitt.
But Mr. Trump seems more enchanted with his plan to create a military Space Force and sends mixed signals about his own exploration program. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that “NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon,” but instead be focusing on Mars.
Even during Friday’s visit with the <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 crew</span>, he began grilling Jim Bridenstine, his NASA administrator, on why the agency was not simply heading directly to Mars. “We need to learn how to live and work on another world,” Mr. Bridenstine explained.
Plenty of space program veterans doubt that Mr. Trump will succeed. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“I don’t think that whoever has opted for this goal has any idea about its cost or practicality,” Mr. Holdren said.</span> “Sending humans to Mars would be such a complex and expensive proposition that I don’t believe it will be done at all unless major nations agree to do it together.”
Michael Foale, a retired astronaut who made extended stays on both the Russian space station Mir and the International Space Station, said <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 deadline</span> “is highly unlikely to be achieved.” But he said he would “fully support” the idea of returning to the moon for a sustained stay, not just another one-off visit.
“The danger of a Kennedy-Trump-style ‘go to the moon’ — and then leave — is that it will disenchant another two generations of the world population with traveling to the moon even if it is successful, and much worse if an accident occurs,” Mr. Foale said.
Still, some past officials see reasons for optimism. “There’s a lot more going for this period of time and this initiative to make this a more possible event than what we’ve seen in the past,” Mr. O’Keefe said. “The technology has developed at an absolutely staggering pace that has made this an achievable objective. We know a lot more about what it will take to achieve it.”"

More Hospitals Are Requiring Workers to Get Covid Vaccines
With some health care workers still refusing to be immunized, medical centers around the country are requiring shots as cases climb once again.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">More and more hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities and even within their work force.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Many hospitals say their efforts to immunize their employees have stalled, in much the same way the nation’s overall vaccination rates are stuck <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 60 percent</span>, behind many European countries and Canada.</span> While more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 96 percent</span> of doctors say they are fully vaccinated, according to the American Medical Association, health care workers, particularly in rural areas, have proven more resistant even though thousands of workers have died from the virus and countless more became sick.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">One recent estimate indicated that one in four hospital workers were not vaccinated by the end of May, with some facilities reporting that fewer than half of their employees had gotten the shots.
</span>Some hospitals, ranging from academic medical centers like NewYork-Presbyterian and Yale New Haven to large chains like Trinity Health, are going ahead with a mandate because they recognize that the only way to stop the virus is to vaccinate as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. A large Arizona-based chain, Banner Health, announced Tuesday that it would impose a mandate, and New York City said it would require all health care workers at city-run hospitals or clinics to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.
Watching cases rise prompted Trinity Health, a Catholic system with hospitals <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 22 states</span>, to become one of the first major groups to decide earlier this month that it would mandate inoculations. “We were convinced that the vaccine can save lives,” said Dr. Daniel Roth, Trinity’s chief clinical officer. “These are preventable deaths.”
At UF Health Jacksonville, in Florida, the number of Covid patients being treated has surged to levels not seen since January, and only half of its health care workers are vaccinated, said Chad Neilsen, the director of infection prevention. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Seventy-five employees are out sick with the virus, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated, while more are waiting for test results.</span> “We are absolutely struggling for staffing right now,” he said.
“It’s like déjà vu,” said Mr. Neilsen, who described growing frustration with colleagues refusing to get the shots. “We have a reason to believe this could be over if people got vaccinated.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Despite dozens of virtual town halls, question-and-answer sessions and educational videos, many employees are wary.</span> “We still stagnated,” Mr. Neilsen said.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some employees want more data, while others say the process has been too rushed.</span> Many of the same conspiracy theories and misinformation — that the vaccines will make women infertile or contain microchips — hold sway among staff members. “Our health care workers are a reflection of the general population,” he said.
Hospital leaders and others plan to meet with state officials in the coming weeks about the possibility of imposing a mandate, he said.
Unvaccinated workers also continue to care for even the sickest patients, raising concerns that they will spread the infection, especially now that the highly contagious Delta variant comprises more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 percent</span> of the nation’s cases.
“Nowhere is this more important than in hospitals, where health care personnel — who have been heroic during this pandemic — are caring for patients with a wide variety of health challenges under the assumption that the health care professionals treating them are not at risk of acquiring or transmitting Covid-19,” Dr. David J. Skorton, the chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents teaching hospitals, said in a statement last Friday calling for a mandate.
With formal approval of the vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration potentially months away, hospitals find themselves at the center of the national debate over whether to impose mandates. While the vaccines are being offered under emergency use authorization, supporters argue there is ample evidence that the ones available in the United States are both safe and effective.
In states like Missouri, which has reported a sharp increase in cases, there is newfound urgency. “We felt we could not wait,” said Dr. Shephali Wulff, the director of infectious diseases for SSM Health, a Catholic hospital system whose headquarters are in St. Louis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">SSM, where about two-thirds of employees are now vaccinated, is requiring everyone to get their first dose by Sept.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>
</span>SSM’s decision was also motivated by concern that Covid infections could spike this fall when there could also be a surge in other respiratory infections. “We need a healthy work force going into the flu season,” Dr. Wulff said. “We do not have the time to wait for approval.”
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But some systems are already worried about staffing shortages caused by departures during the pandemic, with many employees quitting because of the stress and burnout experienced by caring for Covid patients.</span> Hospitals are hesitant to risk losing more workers if they force the issue.
“They are afraid it could be a tipping point,” said Ann Marie Pettis, the president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, one of the professional organizations that is urging hospitals to require the vaccine.
At Mosaic Life Care, a small Missouri hospital group, executives are reluctant to adopt a mandate if other hospitals do not. “We have the potential to lose some caregivers to other systems,” said Joey Austin, a spokeswoman for Mosaic, which has vaccinated <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 62 percent</span> of its staff.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Many hospitals already require their employees to get a flu shot, a mandate that has been in place for over a decade.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">While that was also met by resistance from employees skeptical of the vaccines’ safety, it is now largely accepted.</span> Individuals can seek a medical or religious exemption, typically representing a small sliver of the work force, which hospitals say would also apply to the Covid vaccines.
Mandates “establish a social norm and say it’s an institutional priority,” said Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who emphasized that hospitals need to strongly encourage workers to voluntarily get the vaccines to be successful.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Unions like the National Nurses United <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1199 S</span>.E.I.U. say they want members to be vaccinated but oppose making it a condition of employment.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">At the first hospital to impose a mandate, Houston Methodist, a group of employees sued to challenge the requirement but the lawsuit was recently dismissed.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 150 employees</span> ultimately resigned or were fired for refusing to meet the deadline for vaccination out of a total work force of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 26,000 people</span>.
</span>Hospitals say they are working hard to dispel much of the pervasive misinformation around the vaccines, even among physicians and nurses.
“I have to remind them that reputable scientists do not publish their findings on YouTube,” Dr. Wulff said. In addition to presenting hard data about the vaccine, she and her colleagues at SSM are also sharing their personal experiences, like getting vaccinated while trying to get pregnant. “What I’m finding is people are moved by stories and anecdotes,” she said.
“Generally it’s a lot of listening and homing in on what is driving their fear,” Dr. Wulff said.
Some high-profile systems like Intermountain Healthcare and the Cleveland Clinic are waiting. The clinic, which has a sprawling network <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 18 hospitals</span> in the United States, said existing policies, like masking and closely tracking infections, protect patients and workers.
“We know if we ensure these safety precautions are in place we know we can continue to keep our patients and caregivers safe,” said K. Kelly Hancock, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief caregiver officer.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">About three-quarters of employees are now vaccinated, and efforts are continuing “full force,” she said.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">At Intermountain Healthcare, based in Utah, “a good majority” of employees are vaccinated, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, medical director for infection prevention and control and employee health.
</span>If more safety data is compelling and the F.D.A. approves the vaccines, Intermountain may require immunization along with other hospitals in the state. “We are starting the conversation now in Utah,” she said.
The lack of full F.D.A. approval has also influenced other hospitals. Mass General Brigham, which has vaccinated more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 85 percent</span> of its work force, said it would adopt the requirement as soon as the vaccines were approved.
Some hospitals argue a mandate is not necessary. “In my opinion, there isn’t one right answer,” said Suresh Gunasekaran, the chief executive of the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 90 percent</span></span> of its workers are now vaccinated, he said, adding that he was confident that virtually everyone would be immunized by the end of the year.
The system has been “successful in chipping away” at vaccine hesitancy, Mr. Gunasekaran said, in part because Iowa was involved in the clinical trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Northwell Health, the large New York hospital group, does not require workers to be immunized against the flu but <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 90 percent</span></span> of its work force is vaccinated against it, said Maxine Carrington, Northwell’s chief human resources officer. It is taking a similar approach to Covid.
“We want people to be believers,” Ms. Carrington said, so they are better able to persuade the community at large to get vaccinated. She described the system as “pounding the pavement on education, education, education.” <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 76 percent</span> of its work force is currently vaccinated against Covid. Northwell will revisit the idea of a mandate after F.D.A. approves the vaccines, she said.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Yale New Haven Health is now requiring employees to get vaccinated, as have the other hospitals in Connecticut.
</span>“From the very beginning, we messaged that it isn’t mandatory — yet. We emphasized the yet,” said Dr. Thomas Balcezak, the chief clinical officer for Yale.
“Health care has to lead,” he said.

34121,"<h3>The Politics of Self-Esteem</h3>Welcome to what I’ve called “the politics of self-esteem.” By this, I mean that increasing numbers of people, on both the right and left, and most with good intentions, have become politically engaged because it makes them feel better. It raises their self-esteem. This phenomenon predates Donald Trump’s candidacy, but it helps explain a Trump puzzle that baffles many observers.
By now, the puzzle is familiar. Trump repeatedly says things that seem (by conventional wisdom) hateful, offensive, stupid or simply wrong. But instead of these apparent missteps backfiring — sowing doubt about his competence and moral values — just the opposite happens. The more Trump flouts prevailing norms, the more popular he becomes among Republicans. The latest example: After proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which was widely criticized, his support among Republicans jumped <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 38 percent</span> in December <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 32 percent</span> in November, according to a Washington Post-ABC News survey.
Trump has not redefined politics, but he has exploited a fundamental change of recent decades. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Since World War II, much of national politics has involved a struggle for economic benefits.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1940,</span> the government transferred <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span> of national income from some groups to others.</span> Now, that share is <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 20 percent</span>. This remains a huge part of politics, as debates over highway spending, farm subsidies, taxes and so much more remind us. But spending decisions are incremental; sweeping shifts are unlikely. We’re not going to abolish Social Security.
Against this backdrop, politics is increasingly shaped by issues that are cast in moral terms: abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, global warming, guns, immigration and health care — to name a few. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Compared with most economic matters, these issues are much more combustible politically.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">On many economic questions, you can negotiate compromises that please, or displease, almost everyone equally.</span> There’s room for give-and-take. By contrast, compromises on moral questions are usually hard and often impossible.
The people who support these various moral crusades — again, right and left — are generally sincere. Liberals pledge to save the planet; conservatives vow to end illegal immigration. But their very passion suggests that they feel morally superior to their opponents and crave anything that strengthens their sense of superiority. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">They receive what I call “psychic benefits,” just as Social Security beneficiaries receive economic benefits.</span> Significantly, these psychic benefits do not require the enactment of legislative agendas. Anything that makes your side look good or the other side look bad will suffice.
What his supporters most like about Trump, even if they disagree with some of his policies (as some inevitably do), is that he defines himself — he does not let others do it for him, and this rubs off on them. It’s liberating. As he asserts his moral superiority over the judgments of the “political establishment” and “mainstream media,” so can his supporters defy others’ hostile judgments of their values. In the contest for the high moral ground, they have a champion and a spokesman. They feel better about themselves. These are the psychic benefits.
For the “political establishment” and “mainstream media” — admittedly ambiguous groups — this poses a dilemma. When Trump makes proposals that strike them as simplistic, unworkable, undesirable or, worse, racist, they have two choices, both bad. If they decide not to react, their silence may seem to condone policies that they abhor. The second choice is to denounce many of Trump’s ideas, but this plays into his hands because the more he is attacked by despised outsiders, the more popular and admired he becomes among supporters.
What results is a bizarre, though fascinating, spectacle. Trump proposes. His opponents (pundits, politicians, “experts”) pounce — criticizing and fulminating. And Trump’s popularity rises.
It is not inevitable that this cycle continue indefinitely. Trump may stumble. Some other candidate — or candidates — may soar. The avalanche of criticism may reach a critical mass, raising fresh doubts among some followers. Or Trump’s outsize ego may begin to offend onetime allies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Politics is a fickle business.</span> Still, Trump’s success has so far stunned many veteran reporters and election observers who have underestimated his political skills.
The more durable lesson here concerns the politics of self-esteem. Our system of governance is increasingly infused with a sanctimony all along the ideological spectrum that makes political accommodation and compromise harder to achieve. Well-intentioned people often act in rigid ways that maximize their self-esteem while perversely making it harder for the country to govern itself.

80490,"<h3>Hedge Funds Gear Up for Another Big Short</h3>Some money managers are looking to profit from potential trouble at some ‘alternative’ mutual funds and bond ETFs

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015

Wall</span> Street is preparing for panic on Main Street.

Hedge funds are lining up to profit from potential trouble at some “alternative” mutual funds and bond exchange-traded funds that have boomed in popularity among retirees and other individual investors.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Financial advisers have pushed ordinary investors into those funds in search of higher returns, a strategy that has come into favor as Federal Reserve benchmark interest rates remain near zero.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But many on Wall Street worry that junk bonds, bank loans and esoteric investments held by some of those funds will be extremely hard to sell if the market turns, leaving prices pummeled in a rush for the exits.

</span>Concerns about such scenarios have been escalating for some time. Now, investment firms such as Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">APO 0.52</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LP are laying the groundwork to cash in if they come to pass.

Apollo has been raising money from wealthy investors for a hedge fund that snaps up insurance-like contracts called credit-default swaps that benefit if the junk bonds fall. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Apollo predicted: “ETFs and similar vehicles increase ease of access to the high yield market, leading to the potential for a quick ‘hot money’ exit.”

Guided by a similar outlook, Reef Road Capital LLC, led by former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. proprietary trader Eric Rosen, has been betting against, or shorting, exchange-traded funds that hold junk bonds and buying options that will pay off if the value of these high-yield securities falls.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“They are going to be toast,” David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital LP, said of the funds holding hard-to-sell assets like emerging-market debt and small-capitalization stocks.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It will be one of our first levels of shorting the moment we start to see cracks, because it’s ripe with retail, emotional investors.”

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">In a way, the moves resemble efforts by some hedge funds to find a way to wager against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">At the time, the country brimmed with highly indebted homeowners who had been encouraged to borrow more in a low-interest-rate environment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">John Paulson’s eponymous hedge-fund firm made billions of dollars betting against the subprime-mortgage market.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The risk now is that this latest era of low interest rates has made risky junk bonds, which pay relatively high returns, disproportionately attractive for investors.

</span>The hedge funds are taking aim at what is regarded by many on Wall Street as a weak spot in the markets. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Liquid alternative” funds have emerged as one of the hottest products in finance, fueled by a promise to deliver hedge-fund-style investing to the masses.</span> They use many of the same strategies as hedge funds, with wagers both on and against markets, but are open to less-wealthy investors with fees closer to mutual-fund standards.

Liquid-alternative funds manage a <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cumulative $446 billion</span>, according to fund tracker Lipper, up <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $83 billion</span> at the start <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2009.</span> High-yield bond ETFs, another popular product, manage more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $38 billion</span>, and in the week ended last Wednesday took in their biggest inflows on record <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.5 billion</span>, Lipper said.

Critics said both sets of products suffer from a similar weakness. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They promise investors the ability to trade in and out as they would with a stock, but the underlying securities trade far less frequently, meaning there may not be buyers waiting when the funds line up to sell.</span> The Securities and Exchange Commission allows mutual funds to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">keep 15% of</span> their holdings in illiquid assets, or those that may take more than a week to sell.

Activist investor Carl Icahn brought the issue to the fore last week, saying at an investment conference that he feared a bubble was expanding in junk bonds thanks to the rush into high-yield exchange-traded funds run by companies like BlackRock Inc.

Managers of ETFs and liquid-alternative funds said they are well-protected against any tumult. Some have lines of credit to cover redemptions if needed and point to research showing that even during past crises, mutual-fund investors generally withdraw no more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2% of</span> assets each month.

“A lot of the questions come from a fundamental misunderstanding of ETF mechanics,” said Matthew Tucker, a managing director at BlackRock, the top manager by assets of ETFs, with more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> of such funds under its purview. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He said that in past downturns, the firm’s high-yield bond ETF actually had increased trading volume from firms looking to make both bullish and bearish bets, making it easier to buy and sell shares.

</span>BlackRock asked the SEC last month for permission to borrow from some of its mutual funds to pay redemptions in others. Mr. Tucker said the practice won’t apply to the high-yield fund; a spokeswoman said the firm’s liquid-alternative products were among those it may use to take advantage of the practice. The SEC decision is pending.

Hedge funds’ pessimistic outlook is still unproved, as bond markets remain stable by historical standards. Apollo’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $140 million</span> fund dealing in credit-default swaps is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 4% through</span> midyear, a person familiar with the matter said.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Debt issued by junk-rated companies recently traded at <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 98 cents</span> on the dollar, up from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 61 cents</span> at the end <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2008,</span> according to a Barclays PLC index.</span> But many doubters aren’t deterred and privately have been telling clients they see trouble ahead.

Hedge-fund firm Rimrock Capital Management LLC has doubled the proportion of cash it carries and shifted toward higher-grade, more easily traded bonds, so that is able to pounce quickly on any signs of distress, a person familiar with the matter said. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The idea is to offer the liquid-alternatives funds and ETFs cut-rate prices for thinly traded holdings like low-rated corporate debt and bank loans when they are forced to sell to meet daily redemptions.

</span>“It sounds like just one more promise of something for nothing,” wrote Oaktree founder Howard Marks in a memo to clients this year. “No investment vehicle should promise more liquidity than is afforded by its underlying assets.”

81106,"<h3>Gary Cohn’s Goldman Exit Tops $100 Million</h3>Beyond empty summitry, a harder-edged U.S. strategy comes into focus

Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 6</span>:48 am ET

HANOI—On its face, Donald Trump’s deference to Xi Jinping at their summit was a victory for China, although not nearly the surrendering of U.S. leadership in Asia to the Chinese strongman that some critics allege.

Mr. Xi’s China, Mr. Trump said, paying fulsome tribute to the omnipotence of the newly crowned supreme leader standing next to him, could fix the North Korean nuclear crisis “easily and quickly.”

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Chinese trade abuses, he appeared to absolve Mr. Xi of all responsibility, provocatively suggesting there is honor in the way Chinese leaders game the global trading system to win advantage for their people.</span> “I give China great credit,” he said.

Look beyond the flattery, however, and a harder-edged strategy comes into focus.

As Mr. Trump lavished praise on the Chinese president—“You’re a very special man,” he purred—three U.S. aircraft-carrier strike groups prowled the Western Pacific. They are a reminder of the military options the Pentagon is weighing against Pyongyang, knowing that while China could do more to pressure Kim Jong Un to slow his nuclear buildup, Mr. Xi’s leverage is in fact limited.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, back in Washington, lower-level aides are dusting off a rarely used Cold War-era trade weapon that invokes national-security considerations to push back against Chinese steel and aluminum dumping.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The action reflects an acknowledgment that Mr. Xi has no intention of abandoning predatory industrial policies to bring China, in his words, “closer to the center” of the world, and that conventional counters to Chinese abuses, like World Trade Organization complaints, don’t work.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">All this suggests that a largely vacuous meeting in Beijing, featuring a high quota of bonhomie from Mr. Trump and a low measure of economic deliverables from Mr. Xi, may go down in history as the prelude to a face-off on trade and other contentious issues that Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened during his campaign but has so far conspicuously failed to bring on.

</span>Indeed, empty summitry may have been part of the White House game plan.

Both sides normally strain for agreements to show progress toward the all-round engagement that has been the Holy Grail of successive U.S. presidents since Nixon. This time was different. Nobody was fooled by <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $250 billion</span> in commercial deals signed. Some were already in the works, hastily packaged up for the occasion, while others were memorandums of understanding that mean just that—paper promises that often end up in the bin.

Focus exclusively on his gushing personal diplomacy and the view might be that Mr. Trump was played like a fiddle.

Dwell on the modest takeaways and the White House appears to have used the summit to signal it is no longer playing the old game of pretend. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Is this why, after Mr. Trump had left Beijing, his hosts figuratively ran after their guest with a more substantial offer—improved market access for U.S. securities firms and banks?</span> White House aides suggest this concession was granted, not demanded.

In this more nuanced reading of the summit from Washington’s perspective, Mr. Trump’s assigned role was to enhance a rapport with Mr. Xi that will help anchor the relationship in advance of expected turbulence ahead.

There was nothing subtle, though, about Mr. Trump’s address to Asian leaders gathered in the Vietnamese coastal resort of Da Nang. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In front of a group dedicated to multilateral trade, he thundered his insistence on one-on-one agreements.</span> Instead of offering a sweeping American vision for the region to compete with Mr. Xi’s “China Dream,” which often overrides the ideals and ambitions of smaller Asian nations, he came up with a slogan coined in Japan—a “free and open Indo-Pacific”—with hardly any elaboration.

Borrowing a line from Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Trump took a dig at the ethno-nationalism that imbues Mr. Xi’s dream, as well as his “Belt and Road” initiative: “The world has many places, many dreams and many roads,” he said to scattered applause. His America First stridency, though—“but in all of the world there’s no place like home”—was received in silence.

There’s his problem: The marketing of nationalism—each country for itself—creates fissures in Asia. Whether Mr. Trump is confronting North Korean nuclear terror, or Chinese territorial assertiveness, he needs an Asian coalition behind him, which means first of all promoting common values in a region of traders. Mr. Xi understands this, at least rhetorically. He got a standing ovation for his speech that spoke of “building a community with a shared future for mankind.”

Mr. Xi’s attempts to pose as the savior of open markets and globalization draw as much skepticism today as when he first pitched himself in that role at Davos this year. But what he offers is inclusion, not retreat.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Having forged the region in its own image—a free-trading and substantially democratic dynamo—the U.S. now risks bequeathing the fruits to a rising China.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The sharp rise in world energy prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the U.K.’s inflation rate to four-decade highs, and prompted the BOE to raise its key interest rate more aggressively than it had planned before the war.

The U.K.’s central bank first raised its key rate in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2021,</span> three months before the Federal Reserve began to lift its key rate. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Fed has moved more quickly, and its key rate now stands at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 3% and</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>25%, while the BOE’s key rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 2.25%.</span>
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Recent reversals in government policy have clouded the outlook for U.K. inflation and interest rates.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The government announced a package of tax cuts on Sept.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 that</span> the BOE saw as likely to lead to higher inflation than it had expected to see when it last released forecasts, and a larger rise in its key interest rate.
</span>“As things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps thought in August,” BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey said Saturday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, the government Monday reversed most of those tax cuts, cut the period over which energy prices would be capped for all households to six months from two years, and pledged additional tax rises and spending cuts.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Over the coming months, the energy price cap means that the rate of inflation is set to rise only slightly, with the central bank expecting it to peak <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11% before</span> the end of this year.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But many households may now face sharply higher energy bills through much of next year, which would tend to keep inflation high for longer.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">However, tax rises and spending cuts will likely have the opposite impact on inflation <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">beyond 2023.</span>

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Consider:
• College tuition has <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">soared 1,375% since</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1978,</span> more than four times the rate of overall inflation, Labor Department data show.

</span>• Median rent nationally hit an all-time high <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1,008 a</span> month in the second quarter of this year, according to Census Bureau data. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">It <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 20% faster</span> than the overall inflation rate <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1990 to</span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span>

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Educational Debt Isn’t Necessarily Good Debt
Some parents tell their kids not to worry about taking on student-loan debt because it is “good debt.”</span> Investing in yourself is important, but it’s possible to invest too much. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">It’s important to consider your potential career path as well as your debt repayment strategy.
</span>Plenty of people are already in too deep. More <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 million</span> borrowers have defaulted on their loans in the past six years.
Taking out loans isn’t a guarantee you’ll graduate. The think tank Third Way found that at more than a third of American colleges, less than half of the students will earn a credential within eight years.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">And even if you do make it to graduation, who’s to say the degree could win you your dream job?</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Four <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 recent</span> college graduates are in jobs that don’t require degrees, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.
</span>After college, you may want to consider graduate school as a means of moving your career forward. But is it worth it to borrow tens or even hundreds of thousands for that advanced degree?
If your starting salary out of grad school will be more than the loans you take out to cover your education costs, it’s probably a good investment, says Mark Kantrowitz, vice president of research at savingforcollege.com. If you check this box, you should be able to pay off your loans <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 years</span> or less. (There are exceptions, like doctors heading into low-paid training programs. In these cases, use the starting salary after residency and fellowship.)

You can also think incrementally. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Is the amount you will gain in salary after completing a graduate program more than the debt that you must take on to get the degree?</span> If so, it makes sense.

Don’t Assume You Should Buy a Home
A home of one’s own remains an integral part of The American Dream.
But the thing is, a house may not always be a good investment. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Especially in the hottest housing markets.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Sarah Behr, a financial planner and founder of Simplify Financial in San Francisco, said she cautions even those clients who can scrape together enough to buy a home that it may not be the right investment for them.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“Housing as an asset is expensive, so if you’re not going to be somewhere for seven or eight years, it’s hard to break even and hard to know if you’ll make enough equity to offset the cost,” she said.</span> “Even if it is attainable, it’s not necessarily the best use of your money.”
There are a couple things to keep in mind when you’re considering home ownership. You may be one of the fortunate who already have the money to put <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 20% for</span> a down payment. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">But ask yourself: can you afford the monthly mortgage payments, or will it be hard to make ends meet?</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Have you depleted your savings entirely, putting you at risk for default if your employment situation changes?</span> And lastly, per Ms. Behr’s point, think about how long you plan on staying in this house—maybe you’re already restless and planning to move soon, in which case it might be hard to break even, especially if you factor in the considerable costs of closing on a home purchase.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">What’s The Best Place for Financial Growth?
</span>Another achievement up for debate: living in your dream city. It might not be as dreamy as you think.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Yes, there are cool jobs in growing sectors, drawing young graduates to places like New York and San Francisco.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But housing costs in those cities are high.
</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Some make it work by living far outside the city center, where things are often cheaper, or by putting a hold on their financial goals to free up more room in the budget for pricier housing.
</span>Others leave these places altogether. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tenn., and Portland, Ore., are seeing a boom as workers leave big, pricey cities to instead work remotely in less expensive areas.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Median home prices have still risen in these cities, but owning a home is more achievable.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">The median home price in Nashville, for example, <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $276,800 in</span> <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2019,</span> still lower than the national media home price <span id=""82"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $280,800,</span> according to the National Association of Realtors.
</span>If you want to get ahead in the game, think about where you want to live long term as you consider where you go to college or grad school. <span id=""43"" class=""red"">Unless you’re at a top school, the employers coming to recruit on campus might largely be regional, so pick somewhere you think you’d want to work after graduation, says Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a coaching firm.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">Not All the Old Rules Are Dead
Part of the generational disconnect is the idea that frugality alone will allow a responsible young professional to reach these financial goals.</span> Ditch the Sweetgreen salads and dial back the spending on your fancy coffee, the advice goes, and you’ll be able to afford that down payment in no time.
But Ms. Weeks, the Seattle attorney, already brings her lunch to work. She takes the bus. She and her husband, a leasing professional, have decided they’d rather save money than celebrate their marriage with a wedding. They do hope to take a vacation, just the two of them—something they still haven’t done since they got married <span id=""83"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span>
<span id=""45"" class=""red"">“Fifteen dollars on lunch each day, times seven—[bringing your lunch] might help a little bit, but it’s not going to make a dent in the debt that’s left,” Ms. Weeks said.</span> For her, amassing a down payment seems entirely out of reach right now.
She’s not the only one. The homeownership rate for millennials was <span id=""84"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 38% in</span><span id=""85"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> according to research from the Urban Institute, about seven percentage points lower than the rate of Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers at the same age.
“One of the expectations is you should be able to afford a house, and if you can’t, it’s seen as if you’ve missed one of the rungs you’re meant to climb up in your life,” said Rob Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
“I think for other people, they just give up and say, ‘It’s not going to happen for me.’ And I assume there’s a certain level of disappointment and a sense of failure.”
When the disappointment sets in, some people can be put off of saving or goal-setting entirely. Without advice that feels relevant, they not only give up on traditional goals, but the methods as well.
But while throwing your hands up may provide some temporary relief, it won’t cure this nagging sense of paralysis that holds so many people captive.

You still need to know your numbers—how much you make, how much you owe and how much you spend.
After confronting the numbers, determine reasonable goals and rewards: if you’re not buying a house right away, perhaps you’re contributing to an investing goal or savings account instead. Set aside a small amount of money every month. <span id=""47"" class=""red"">You can automate a monthly deposit and account for that in your budget so you don’t “miss” the money and feel crunched on cash.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">From there, maybe you drop your savings in a high-interest savings account, or do your research and explore the world of investing.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">The cost of putting money to work in the stock market is lower than ever, especially if you keep it simple and invest in something like a low-fee S&<span id=""86"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 index</span> fund.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Retirement savings may not be a physical asset like a house or a car, but that pile of money is ultimately the most important financial goal to keep on your list.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">If you’re lucky enough to work for an employer that offers a 401(k) match, take advantage of it.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">If you don’t have a 401(k), consider a Roth IRA, which will allow you to take money out for emergency expenses, and a health-savings account, which will help you escape tax penalties, should you need to withdraw for a medical expense.
</span>A savings account, a 401(k) or a health-savings account aren’t tangible in the same way as a house, but they’re plus marks in your asset column. And if you feel like you have something going right, if you’re contributing in some small way to your future, you’ll feel less helpless in the long run.
There’s one more thing: Within reason, allow yourself some small joys. There’s a difference between someone who saves some money and enjoys themselves occasionally and one who saves nothing and splurges on brunch every day. <span id=""53"" class=""red"">When you’re feeling less helpless about your financial health, you can feel good about putting money toward the things that make life worth living.
</span>The goal-setting isn’t just important for young adults to understand, though; it’s important for their parents to get it, too. A more realistic, empathetic conversation between the generations can also lead to more conversations about money, period.
<span id=""54"" class=""red"">Ms. Weeks knows her parents meant well when they told her college debt was “good debt,” and they also weren’t the only ones to dole out this mistaken advice.
</span>“As you get older, you learn your parents are fallible,” she says. “I wish they’d been more upfront about how hard it was, because it feels like a moral failure when you can’t reach these milestones.”
In Which I Follow My Own Advice
I applied this advice to my own life on a recent drive with my parents back home. I knew I wanted to talk with them about how they’d seemingly so easily reached these huge goals.
When they <span id=""87"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 28,</span> my parents were already married, with a kid and a house. At the same age, after a series of too-many-roommates scenarios, I now split rent with my girlfriend, and we’re both on the same page when it comes to spending money. <span id=""55"" class=""red"">We budget together every month and we share a credit card, mostly for the convenience, but also for the points.</span> One day, we want to own a home, but for now, we’re just trying to save what we can without sacrificing the occasional dinner out. After seeing our friends drop thousands of dollars on weddings, we’ve agreed a big party like that isn’t in the cards right now.
I’ve had to redefine so many of my goals. Home ownership, as much as I dream about it, just isn’t a viable option for me right now, and like Ms. Behr suggested, I don’t know if it would make the best use of my savings, either. <span id=""56"" class=""red"">Instead, I do what I can: I have taken advantage of every 401(k) match offered (in my first job, that was <span id=""88"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 1%,</span> but I was so excited) and I contribute every month to my savings and investing accounts.</span> I want to learn more about investing and I still dream of buying a little house with a wide window seat, just like the ones I bookmark on Zillow. But for the time being, I feel comfortable just setting aside what I can.
And as my dad told me, he and my mother didn’t start “paying themselves” until much later in their marriage. <span id=""57"" class=""red"">Before then, they were too busy putting money toward their mortgage, their credit card bills and their childcare costs.</span> He said back then they simply didn’t have the cash to stash in a savings account. In that way, I’m already ahead of where they were at my age—just not in a way I expected to be.
The last time I visited my parents, we talked about my own goals. <span id=""58"" class=""red"">I want to go to graduate school one day, but I’m afraid of taking on that much debt.</span> I still want to buy a home, but a down payment feels incredibly elusive to me. My parents, to their credit, tried to understand.
They bought their first home in the 1980s: a one-bedroom starter home in Decatur, Ga. With some help from my grandfather, they came up <span id=""89"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $10,000 for</span> their first down payment (<span id=""90"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $22,200 in</span> today’s dollars).
“You know, <span id=""91"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nowadays 10% isn</span>’t enough,” I told my mother, reminding her of how she and my dad afforded their first house. Lending practices have changed. “A lot of times, you have to <span id=""92"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 20% already</span> saved for your down payment.”
She was shocked. “Who can save <span id=""93"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 20% for</span> a down payment?”

Wages climbed at a rapid pace in the year through March, a sign that labor shortages are prodding employers to increase wages to retain and attract workers — and a signal that climbing pay could keep inflation elevated, ramping up pressure on the Federal Reserve as it contemplates how much and how quickly to cool down the economy.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The central bank is trying to slow demand to a more sustainable pace at a moment when inflation is running at its fastest pace <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Officials began raising interest rates in March and have suggested that they might increase them by half a percentage point in May — twice as much as usual.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Making money more expensive to borrow and spend can slow consumption and eventually hiring, tempering wage and price growth.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Friday’s employment report probably bolsters the case for a supersized increase.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Wages have picked up <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.6 percent</span> over the past year, a report Friday showed, a far quicker pace than <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 percent</span> annual pay gains that were typical during the 2010s.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">At the same time, the jobless rate fell, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3.6 percent</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.8 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Unemployment is now just slightly above the half-century lows it had reached before the pandemic.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The year-ago wage number continues to run very strong; it sort of ends any debate about whether the unemployment rate is giving a faithful, reliable signal about the job market,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The job market is tight.”
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">While the strong labor market has given policymakers confidence that they can slow the economy somewhat without causing an outright recession, such rapid pay gains could also perpetuate price increases by helping to sustain consumer demand and prodding companies to raise prices as they try to cover higher labor costs.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The promise of wages moving up is a great thing,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said after the central bank’s decision to raise interest rates last month in a bid to cool off the economy.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But the increases are “running at levels that are well above what would be consistent <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2 percent</span> inflation, our goal, over time.”
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">With March’s figures, wages are increasing at an even faster rate over the year than they were when Mr. Powell made his remark.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Leisure and hospitality pay shot up as wages rose broadly.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Percent change in earnings for non-managers since <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2019
Quickly</span> climbing pay comes as employers compete for a finite pool of workers.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">There are <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 1.8 job</span> openings for every unemployed worker, and companies complain of struggling to hire across a range of skill sets and industries.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">“If it remains this tight, a wage-price spiral will only accelerate from here,” Mr. Feroli said.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Of the Fed, he said, “I do think they probably think it is unsustainable.”
</span>Over the past year, pay has picked up most markedly for workers in the leisure and hospitality industry, climbing <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14.9 percent</span>, while workers in transportation and warehousing have also received double-digit pay gains. Those figures are for workers who are not supervisors.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Wages climbed markedly in leisure and hospitality again last month, while pay also picked up sharply for workers in the financial and durable goods industries.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">While rapid wage growth is a boon for many workers, families are finding that their paychecks, while bigger, no longer buy as much as prices rise.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Pay gains are not quite keeping pace with inflation for many workers.</span>"
76325,"<h3>Tech workers had their pick of jobs for years. That era is over for now.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Although Tiara Richardson read news articles warning of looming Big Tech layoffs, she still hoped her job as a content designer for Meta would be safe.</span> She had been with the company for four months and said, at one point, her team was considered a priority for the company.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Richardson, a 40-year-old in Raleigh, N.C., had been working remote the past four months with a team she enjoyed and just found her stride when she and <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11,000 of</span> her colleagues lost their jobs.
</span>“I just started bawling,” she said. “I had never been in that position before. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">… I started thinking, ‘Oh my God, what if I can’t find a job?’”
Richardson joins hundreds of thousands of tech workers that are in the same boat — unexpectedly out of work and hunting for their next gig.</span> Twitter, Meta, Stripe, Lyft and most recently Salesforce and Amazon are among some of the most notable companies that have slashed their workforces.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While many laid-off tech workers are finding job openings, they say that there are far fewer and that they’re having to combat larger numbers of top talent for new roles.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The layoffs aren’t deterring workers from the tech industry, several workers say, and they still view tech jobs as opportunities for professional growth and increased earnings.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But the cuts are making them look for roles that may offer more job security in the long run.
</span>Data shows the outlook isn’t all that gloomy, just yet. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Employers added <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 223,000 jobs</span> in December, and the unemployment rate fell to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.5 percent</span>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The tech layoffs are not entirely a reflection of economic conditions, Rand Ghayad, head of economics and global labor markets at LinkedIn wrote in a recent blog post.</span> They are, in part, a move to return to more normal hiring.
Richardson posted on LinkedIn a month after being laid off to let her network know she was open to new opportunities. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">When she started applying for jobs in December and January, she noticed she was competing with hundreds, if not thousands, in her industry for the same positions.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">(LinkedIn shows how many candidates have applied for the position at the top of job postings.)
</span>“The competition is going to be more fierce,” she said. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“For the jobs I have applied for, I’ve gotten more rejection notices than I had previously,” she said.
</span>Hiring in the tech, information and media industry is at its lowest level since <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2020,</span> according to LinkedIn’s member data. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40 percent</span> of LinkedIn members in the industry who hopped jobs in November stayed in the industry.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Others have left for the professional services, like legal or accounting firms, or financial services industries.</span> The wait for tech workers to get their next gig may not be long, according to October data from ZipRecruiter. <span id=""13"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 37 percent</span> of surveyed laid-off tech workers found a new job within one month, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 79 percent</span> were employed within three months.
</span>For Meagan Moakes, getting laid off was unfortunately a familiar experience, but this instance may have come at the worst timing as her husband was laid off two days prior. Moakes, a 37-year-old Dallas resident, has been laid off four times in her career.
“By the fourth time, you’re kind of numb to it,” Moakes said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We went from a two-income family to a one-income family to a no-income family <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span>.”
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Moakes said her plight has vastly contrasted that of her husband, who seems to be more in demand as a video game developer.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But as someone who has worked in customer relationship roles for big and small tech companies, she’s applying for jobs that often have anywhere <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 350 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,600 other</span> candidates, many from Big Tech companies, she said.</span> As a result, she’s starting to doubt her own skills and accomplishments.
“I feel like I’m lost in a sea of numbers,” she said.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Vahan Terterian has applied to at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 150 positions</span> since he lost his job in December, but only a handful have responded with interest.</span> The 26-year-old Denver resident was most recently a product manager at rental tech company Nomad, where he worked for seven months before cuts hit.
“I had a sinking feeling in my chest,” he recalls thinking about the upcoming layoffs.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">After taking a few days to recover from the shock of losing his job, Terterian said he, too, started to realize how many people he’s up against for current openings — a much different reality than when he landed his job in May.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The market is flooded with high-quality talent,” he said.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">“So it seems slower than when I first got this job in May.</span> It was booming [back then].”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Terterian said he’s asking hiring employers more specific questions about their financial stability, hiring and outlook to avoid another layoff.
</span>For 36-year-old Amber Adamson, the strategy is to beef up her coding skills to make her more hirable in tech. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Adamson, a Norristown, Penn., resident who’s been transitioning out of her teaching role, started her first technical job as a junior email developer for veterinarian services company Covetrus in June but was laid off in September.
</span>She says the barriers are plentiful for new entrants into the industry. First, prerequisites often require years of experience for entry-level positions, she says. Then there are the hundreds of qualified candidates she’s competing against. She’s seeing more and more laid-off workers from Big Tech companies post that they’re available for hire.
“I’m hoping to make myself more desirable for recruiters, so they’ll reach out to me,” she said. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“You really have to be prepared to sell yourself because the market is saturated.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Some workers are finding that the best path to a new job is through their professional network.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Charell Star, a former lead of brand media, social media and partnerships at Meta’s payments business who’s worked in marketing for the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 20 years</span>, was also part of Meta’s November layoffs after working for the company for more than two years.
</span>The Maplewood, N.J., resident was four months into her five-month maternity leave. It was the second layoff in her career.
Star said the best leads are coming through connections who either heard about her layoff or saw her LinkedIn post announcing it. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">She’s getting tips on jobs that haven’t been posted or roles that have yet to be created, and some of her employed connections are rerouting recruiters to her.</span> So while the layoffs may be increasing competition, they’re also creating a sense of community, she says.
“There is a camaraderie of us going through this together,” she said. “I recommend people start networking and reaching out to old contacts … you never know where an opportunity will come from.”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Richardson, the former content designer at Meta, said she’s getting creative in her job search.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">With a background in fashion and interests in media, fashion, retail, entertainment and tech, she’s contacting her big dream jobs.</span> How big? She said she’s contacted the head of human resources at Parkwood Entertainment and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s company, and approached the Obama Foundation.
“My advice is to keep a positive mind-set, and don’t be afraid to shoot your shot,” she said.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Five quick tips for job seekers
- Include a summary: All professional profiles and résumés should have a summary at the very top that highlight a job seeker’s most marketable skills and give employers a sense of their personality.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">This is even more important for candidates who may not have direct job experience for the position to which they are applying.
- Use keywords: Professional profiles, especially those online, should have keywords sprinkled throughout to help the candidate get past the computer systems that may be reviewing their résumé first.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Experts say job seekers should research the most common qualities and skills needed for the job and include them, if applicable.
- Highlight accomplishments: Job seekers should refrain from relying on job descriptions to explain their previous experience.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Instead, they should highlight their accomplishments with as many specifics as possible.
- Connect with professionals online: Candidates’ professional networks can often lead to the next job.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Experts say job seekers should be contacting people they know within the industries that interest them.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">But they also should be asking for introductions to people whom their friends, family and colleagues may know, as well as messaging people with whom they have no connection at all.
- Post on social media: To increase the chances of getting hired, experts say job seekers would be wise to post on their personal social networks to let people know they’re looking for a job and provide specifics about what they hope to find.

86518,"<h3>Here’s Why the Fed Will Stay Central to Markets</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Returning to a precrisis playbook risks disruptions

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 12</span>:15 pm ET

Federal Reserve officials grappling with the legacy of expansive stimulus would find it difficult to return to the central bank’s precrisis role on the sidelines of financial markets, analysts and central-bank watchers say.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">A long list of programs adopted to help foster economic growth, along with changes in money markets and bank regulation, have vastly expanded the Fed’s balance sheet and its involvement in markets.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed’s assets now <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">total $4.5 trillion</span>, up from less <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> a decade ago.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2013 the</span> central bank has become one of the largest traders with U.S. taxable money-market funds, according to Crane Data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Many analysts and investors worry that significantly rolling back the Fed’s expansion, a course advocated by some in conservative circles, risks disrupting markets and the economy at a time when growth remains tepid.</span> It would also reduce the connections the institution has built with a diverse set of Wall Street firms, beyond the group of banks it dealt with before the crisis.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Fed has become “like an octopus,” said Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles money manager.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Once you get the power and you are influencing all these markets, do you really want to retreat from all that?”

Investors are already assessing how stocks and bonds might react, when the central bank begins the latest stage of its yearslong retreat from stimulus—likely later this year—by ending the practice of reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds into new bonds.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed is scheduled to publish Wednesday the minutes of its latest policy meeting, where officials may have continued their debate over the mix of policy tools they plan to use in the future.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials say they are attracted to maintaining parts of their current approach.</span> Minutes of their November meeting also showed officials discussing the advantages of keeping something similar to the existing system in place, in part because it is simpler to operate than the precrisis one.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Fed hasn’t decided the issue, but its choices will be closely watched because its leadership is in transition.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">President Donald Trump is preparing to fill three vacancies on the Fed’s seven-member board.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The White House hasn’t named its picks, but its choices could set Fed policy in new directions, including by limiting its role in markets.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Republican lawmakers have also revived legislation to subject its decisions to greater public scrutiny, and some want monetary policy conducted by preset rules.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“It’s not your father’s Fed,” said Adam Gilbert, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and a former New York Fed official.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Changes could herald “incoming policy makers who are by nature skeptical of a Fed that continues unorthodox approaches to both monetary and regulatory policy.”

New York Fed President William Dudley told an audience this month the portfolio isn’t likely to return to its precrisis size.</span> Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said this month the portfolio would be “significantly smaller” than it is today, but likely <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $2 trillion</span> in assets.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The ultimate size will be closely tied to which system the central bank decides to use to control interest rates in the future.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A handful of Fed officials have already begun questioning the wisdom of returning to the blueprint for controlling rates that they used before the crisis, although they have more time to decide.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">At the center of the debate is a special investment program the Fed launched <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013.</span></span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Through the facility, it lends money-market funds and others Treasurys in exchange for cash, temporarily draining excess cash from money markets and discouraging lenders from lending at rates below the target range for interest rates.

</span>Initially, the central bank said it would reduce the capacity of this so-called reverse repo facility “fairly soon after” it had begun raising short-term rates <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Today, the Fed has no current plans to do so.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley suggested in April the Fed likely wouldn’t phase out the facility.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Without the Fed repos, short-term rates could slip too low, and demand for Treasurys in the open market would surge, causing problems for money-market funds seeking alternative places to park cash overnight.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Removing the program would “cause huge dislocations from a bond-market standpoint,” said Debbie Cunningham, chief investment officer for global money markets at Federated Investors.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">A balance sheet that is smaller than today’s, yet still substantial, would enable the Fed to keep the reverse repos around.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">It would also support the Fed’s foreign repos for overseas accounts, where weekly balances have <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaged $250 billion</span>, up <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $30 billion</span> precrisis, as well as <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.5 trillion</span> in currency outstanding and changing cash-management policies at the Treasury Department.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">If the Fed reduces its bond portfolio, the burden will be on private market participants to step in.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Morgan Stanley calculates investors may have to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">absorb $400 billion</span> in mortgage bonds alone, a level not seen <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In the past, such transitions were smoothed by the banks authorized to trade opposite the Fed, called primary dealers.</span> Now those firms are grappling with new leverage rules, and some have less capacity.

Communicating a strategy for unwinding risks some unintended signals. <span id=""28"" class=""red""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> when the Fed surprised investors with talk of slowing bond purchases, financial markets convulsed, thinking the Fed meant earlier rate rises than were expected.

A soldier, call sign Petrovich, stands in a trench on the Kherson frontline on Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8.</span> Efforts by Ukrainian forces to recapture seized territory have slowed. (Wojciech Grzedzinski/For The Washington Post)

MYKOLAIV REGION, Ukraine — On the front line in southeast Ukraine, there is little sign that a major counteroffensive is brewing.

For weeks, Western intelligence and military analysts have predicted that a Ukrainian campaign to retake the strategic port city of Kherson and surrounding territory is imminent. But in trenches less than a mile from Russia’s positions in the area, Ukrainian soldiers hunker down from an escalating onslaught of artillery, with little ability to advance.

“It’s to our left side, our right side, over our heads,” said Yuri, a 45-year-old soldier with the Ukrainian military’s 63rd Mechanized Brigade, said of the incoming fire, which has intensified over the past week. At night, Russian forces make reconnaissance missions that probe the tenuously held farmland. “It’s a more tense situation,” he said.

Retaking Kherson would mark a devastating blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The wider region is crucial to providing fresh water to Crimea, a problem that has cost Russia billions of rubles since its illegal annexation of the peninsula <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span></span> It is also a key foothold for any future Russian military push in the south toward Odessa, the coveted jewel on the Black Sea.

But time is slipping if Ukraine is to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky’s stated goal of winning the war by the end of the year, and the current situation on the ground raises the prospect of a long, grinding stalemate instead. Residents who have fled villages in the Kherson region have described Russian forces moving in reinforcements, and officials have eyed those troop movements warily.

“They’ve dug in,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, after returning from a trip to inspect the front lines on Sunday. “We know that they are trying to fortify their positions. The enemy has significantly increased its artillery along the entire line,” he said of the 60-mile-long front line, after returning from visiting positions on Sunday.

Lacking the basic artillery and armored vehicles needed to progress, Ukraine has focused on operations far behind the front lines. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That includes a mysterious attack earlier this week on a Russian air base in Crimea, a major supply hub for Russian operations in Kherson previously assumed to be out of its enemy’s reach.

</span>The progress Ukrainian forces had made here in recent months — recapturing a string of villages from Russia’s control — has largely stalled, with soldiers exposed in the open terrain.

The roads that soldiers zip along among the scorched wheat fields at the front lines are pockmarked with craters from previous strikes, guided by Russia’s Orlan drones that allow them to pick and choose targets.

“There is nowhere to hide,” said Yuri, who has fought here without a break since the beginning of the war, and like other soldiers did not give his last name, in line with protocol. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His unit has a hodgepodge stock: modern antitank weapons and a Soviet machine gun manufactured <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1944,</span> and the focus here is holding the line.

</span>Ukrainian military officials are tight-lipped on any timeline for a wider push, but say they need more supplies of Western weapons before one can happen. Ukraine lacks the capacity to launch a full-scale offensive anywhere along <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,200</span>-mile front line, one security official conceded.

“We have to be honest — for now, Ukraine doesn’t have a sufficient number of weapons systems for a counteroffensive,” said a defense and intelligence adviser to the Ukrainian government who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

“It’s still possible to get a result, but if so it will be the result of smart Ukraine strategy more than of countering Russia with equal power,” the adviser said. “It’s very difficult to match them.”

In an interview this week, Maj. Gen. Dmytro Marchenko, Ukrainian army commander, also said “small batches” of Western military aid means carrying out offensive actions is “very difficult” but expressed optimism that the dynamic would change soon.

“I think once we get the full package of this aid, our counteroffensive will be very quick,” he told RBC newspaper, urging people of Kherson to be “a little patient.”

“It will not be as long as everyone expects,” Marchenko added.

Others have appeared to temper expectations, stressing that the situation is dynamic. In recent days, Russia has launched a new assault on cities in Ukraine’s east.

“It changes pretty much every day because the enemy moves their forces and we change our tactics and maneuvers,” said Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the defense minister. “Things change and plans change.”

The counteroffensive “is already happening” in the way that is feasible, said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s Southern Command, adding that progress will be “little by little” and pointing out that the conflict is a “hybrid war.”

Some have even hinted that the offensive here may have been trumpeted as part of a campaign of informational warfare, designed to draw Russian firepower away from areas farther east.

And Russia has been reinforcing. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 3,000 troops</span> have arrived in the Kherson region over the past week alone, bringing to at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 15,000 the</span> number of Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnieper River, the intelligence adviser said.

Most of them are elite airborne troops who are helping to bolster exhausted Russian forces who have been manning the front line for months, said Kirill Mikhailov, a Kyiv-based analyst with the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian research and investigative group.

Fleeing residents describe Russian troops as hunkering down.

“Two weeks ago they came in with big equipment,” said one 42-year-old from Novovorontsovka, near Kherson, who is in touch with parents there. “They are setting up bases in houses.” A 65-year-old who left the tiny village of Mar’ine on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 11 said</span> Russian forces who had barely been visible earlier in its occupation began moving in large numbers in the days before she fled. “They were digging in trenches,” she said.

The troop movements have raised concerns that Russia could be preparing its own new offensive in the area. But while Russia may try to recover some of the villages retaken by Ukrainian troops in recent months, they also lack the means to launch a large-scale operation, analysts and officials say.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The forces around Kherson city constitute Russia’s only foothold on that side of the river, a natural defensive barrier that carves through Ukraine and requires supply routes to pass through several highly vulnerable chokeholds.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Those supply routes have proven vulnerable to Ukraine’s new U.S.-supplied HIMAR rocket systems.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And with its strike on Crimea, Ukraine has demonstrated the capacity to hit the heart of Russian military installations in the major military supply hub for Moscow’s operations in the south.

</span>But if Ukraine is to conduct a counteroffensive “the clock is ticking,” Mikhailov said. It’s going to be the muddy season by October, making military movements difficult.

Outgunned, Ukraine is also using hybrid tactics. In the city, much of the local population is hostile to occupation, said Konstantin Ryzhenko, a Ukrainian journalist in hiding there. Russian soldiers are already not visible on the streets of the city in fear of attacks, he said.

Those who remain, including officers from Russia’s FSB intelligence service and police, have moved their bases to civilian locations under hospitals and in urban areas, in fear of HIMAR strikes, Ryzhenko said.

“It just takes one of them to turn around for five seconds for them to be distracted, for them to be hung up and drowned,” he said of Russian troops. In late June, a senior Russian appointed official in the city was killed in a bomb blast.

Given the strike in Crimea, Russia’s hold over Kherson is in jeopardy, said Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank.

“I think the Russians will pull out of Kherson soon,” he said. “It’s becoming untenable — really hard to resupply forces.”

That would stymie any Russian goal, however unrealistic, to take all of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and create a connection to the Russian-controlled territory of Transnistria in Moldova. And others point to Russia’s willingness to sacrifice its soldiers even for operations that don’t make strategic sense, while Ukraine typically moves forward only with caution.

“The Ukraine army will never do anything stupid, like Russia, throwing people like cannon fodder into battle to satisfy the ambitions of their leaders,” Sak said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The question is the price.”

</span>Russia is less militarily vulnerable in areas of Kherson province that lie on the eastern banks of the Dnieper River. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">That territory is essential to Putin’s long-sought “land bridge” to Crimea and its fresh water supply.

</span>In the first days following the invasion, Russian forces blew up a dam in a canal in the region that had long infuriated Putin. Ukraine dammed the waterway <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 following</span> Russia’s occupation of the peninsula. Once-fertile farmland turned into parched barren flats, and the Kremlin was forced to pay out billions in subsidies and to invest in new water projects.

It’s a region Putin is unlikely to relinquish without a ferocious fight.

Although Ukraine has enough manpower to launch a push, Sak said that without more sophisticated weaponry there is a risk of sending troops needlessly to their deaths in an offensive with marginal chances of success.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some Ukrainian military units are already paying a price.</span> For nearly six months, Ukraine’s 28th Mechanized Brigade has fought along the southern front, stopping a lightning advance by Russian forces outside the city of Mykolaiv.

The unit’s battle-hardened fighters continue to claw back territory as they inch closer to Kherson. Despite being some of the best equipped and most professionally trained units on the front lines, withering Russian artillery strikes across the open steppe have maimed and killed many of their fighters.

In late July, the 28th Mechanized Brigade’s commander, Vitalii Huliaiev, was killed in action and his fellow soldiers intend to avenge his death.

“We will get to Kherson,” said a battalion commander for the unit who goes by the call sign Zloi, which translates as Angry or Mean. “We will have our revenge.”

47642,"<h3>New CEO Wants to Make Barnes & Noble Your Local Bookstore</h3>Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 6</span>:00 am ET

LONDON—Barnes & Noble Inc.’s new chief executive wants to run America’s largest bookstore chain more like a collection <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 627 independent</span> stores.

James Daunt, who also leads Britain’s largest bookstore chain, Waterstones, on Wednesday became Barnes & Noble’s fifth permanent chief executive in six years after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. closed its deal to buy the company.

The New York-based chain long worked to give its locations a similar look, feel and inventory, but readers shunned the stores in recent years.

Mr. Daunt plans to reinvigorate the U.S. book giant by applying a playbook that has worked well in the U.K.: Giving individual stores the autonomy to buy and promote books they bet will resonate with the local clientele.

“Barnes & Noble is what Waterstones used to be. They run identical bookshops up and down the country,” said Mr. Daunt. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“You should do what you want; there are no restrictions on what books you stock, how you display them, what you promote.</span> Each bookshop is quite individual.”

The 55-year-old Briton, who led Waterstones out of a difficult period earlier this decade and will remain its CEO, is widely respected in the book industry.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“His sensibilities about our business are excellent and I think Barnes & Noble having him attempting to turn the ship around is as good news as anyone could have asked for,” said Oren Teicher, head of the American Booksellers Association.

</span>But Barnes & Noble has twice as many stores as Waterstones. Many are larger and in less desirable locations, like suburban strip malls rather than busy shopping streets.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Barnes & Noble stores are too big to be filled with assortments of local relevance and be economically viable,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.

</span>The new CEO, who will relocate to New York, will have to woo Americans who are reading less. The percentage of U.S. adults who said they had read a book in any format over the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 12 months</span> dropped <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 74% last</span> year <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 79% in</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> according to Pew Research Center.

Mr. Daunt—who started his career as an investment banker—opened his first bookstore in London <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1990,</span> at the age <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 26.</span> He named it Daunt Books and opened a further eight stores, all of which exist today and remain independent.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> Mr. Daunt was hired to stem sliding sales at Waterstones by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut who bought the British chain for £53 million from HMV Group PLC.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Revenue deteriorated for three more years, hurt by competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle.</span> Mr. Daunt decentralized decision making and refurbished stores. He closed the head office, and moved some managers to space above the flagship store in London’s Piccadilly Circus and others to regional locations close to clusters of stores.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">For <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2018,</span> Waterstones reported an underlying profit of £16.32 million across <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 278 shops</span>, compared with a loss of £42.91 million <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2012 from</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 286 stores</span>.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Sales at the Piccadilly store are on track to hit £14 million this year, up from below £8 million in<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> said Mr. Daunt.

Elliott, which bought Waterstones <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> decided to buy Barnes & Noble after Mr. Daunt convinced executives his strategy could translate to the larger chain, according to a person familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The hedge fund took comfort in the stabilizing market for physical books.</span> It plans to expand the chain’s footprint by opening smaller stores in high-traffic locations like city centers, the person said.

Mr. Daunt—who describes the U.S. as “extraordinarily underbookshopped”—says he doesn’t expect to close many stores. He will first look to renegotiate <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 20% of</span> leases that end each year to ensure stores are profitable.

<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 80% of</span> Barnes & Noble’s books are bought and allocated by its head office, while all promotions are decided centrally, according to Mr. Daunt and publishing executives.

Publishers pay tens of thousands of dollars for chain bookstores to display their new books on promotional tables for a few weeks.

That means shoppers at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan will see the same titles on display as visitors to a branch at a mall in Idaho Falls. Books that don’t sell are sent back to publishers.

Mr. Daunt stopped accepting placement payments from publishers for Waterstones, which he said decreased the share of books stores sent back <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% from</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25%.</span> He is aiming for a similar reduction at Barnes & Noble.

“You need to try to put the right books in the right places and it requires you to trust the local people to make the right decisions,” he said.

At Waterstones, central buyers send stores limited copies of books they think will work at a given location but further orders are made by local buyers, with input from store staff. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Stores are sent a daily compilation of reviews and upcoming media appearances, while booksellers are encouraged to trade tips with neighboring stores.

</span>“You get lots of information but no instruction,” said Mr. Daunt. “It’s the opposite at Barnes & Noble.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Brian Murray, CEO of HarperCollins Publishers, said American book sales are more media-driven than British ones.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That, he said, could leave Barnes & Noble stores that prioritize local input vulnerable to a shortage of books for which there is national demand, sending customers into Amazon’s arms.

</span>“James has the experience, he knows in his gut how to be a bookseller,” he said. “He has to quickly learn how the U.S. is different to the U.K. and figure out how to execute on his vision.”

HarperCollins Publishers is a unit of The Wall Street Journal’s parent company, News Corp.

On a recent morning at the Piccadilly Circus Waterstones, Europe’s largest bookstore <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 50,000 square</span> feet, a sign described books piled on a table near the cash register as “devastating masterpieces.”

Stuart Collie and other staff came up with the theme and decided what books to include. Mr. Collie proudly pointed to a table piled with William Boyd’s “Love is Blind” and another featuring “There There” by Tommy Orange, both authors he decided to promote.

“It’s a really nice feeling when a book sells because of you,” he said.

34811,"<h3>Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus at CPAC: ‘If the Party and the Conservative Movement Are Together, It Can’t Be Stopped’</h3>American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp hosted a conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House strategist Steve Bannon on Thursday at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CPAC 2017.</span>
Priebus began by declaring that President Trump, who will also speak at CPAC, would become known as “one of the greatest presidents that ever served this country.”
Schlapp noted that Trump will also be the first president to address CPAC during his first year in office since Ronald Reagan <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981,</span> and he congratulated Trump for assembling “the most conservative Cabinet we’ve ever seen, according to our CPAC ratings.”
When Schlapp asked for the “biggest misconception about what’s going on in the Donald Trump White House,” Priebus replied: “In regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you’re reading.”
Priebus and Bannon said that contrary to media reports about friction between them, they’re working very well together.
“It’s actually something that you all helped build,” Priebus told the audience. “When you bring together, and what this election showed, and what President Trump showed — and let’s not kid ourselves, I mean I can talk about data and ground game, and Steve can talk about big ideas, but the truth of the matter is, Donald Trump, President Trump brought together the party and the conservative movement.”
The President’s chief of staff went on to say, prompting a burst of applause:
And I’ve got to tell you, if the party and the conservative movement are together — similar to Steve and I — it can’t be stopped. And President Trump was the one guy, he was the one person — and I can say it after <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">overseeing 16 people</span> kill each other — it was Donald Trump that was able to bring this party and this movement together. Steve and I know that, and we live it every day. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Our job is to get the agenda of President Trump through the door, and on pen and paper.
</span>Bannon, formerly a Breitbart News executive, argued that the mainstream media has been consistently wrong in how it portrayed the Trump campaign, the transition, and now the administration during its first months.
“If you remember, the campaign was the most chaotic, by the media’s description, most chaotic, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no earthly idea what they were doing — and then you saw them all crying and weeping that night on the Eighth,” he recalled.
Bannon agreed with Priebus that President Trump’s ideas, energy, and vision were the key to galvanizing a broad coalition of supporters around him.
“A lot of people have strong beliefs about different things, but we understand that you can come together to win, and we understood that from August 15th,” Bannon said. “We never had a doubt, and Donald Trump never had a doubt that he was going to win.”
Priebus and Bannon both emphasized how much of Trump’s agenda is clearly laid out in his speeches, going all the way back to his appearance at <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CPAC 2011.</span>
“What all of us were starving for the whole time, because we’re so sick of politics and politicians — in spite of the fact that we love being here, we actually hate politics — but what we were starving for was somebody real,” Priebus contended. “Somebody genuine, somebody that was actually who he said he was.”
“If you want to see the Trump agenda, it’s very simple: it was all in the speeches,” said Bannon. “He went around to these rallies with those speeches that had a tremendous amount of content in them. I happen to believe, and I think many others do, he’s probably the greatest public speaker in those large arenas since William Jennings Bryan.”
“Remember, we didn’t have any money,” Bannon pointed out. “Hillary Clinton and these guys had <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $2 billion</span>. We had a couple of hundred million dollars. It was those rallies and those speeches. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">All he’s doing right now is he’s laid out an agenda with those speeches, to the promises he made, and our job every day is just to execute on that, to simply get a path to how those get executed.”
</span>Bannon testified that President Trump’s response to advice that he should deviate from his agenda for short-term political benefit has been, “No, I promised the American people this, and this is the plan we’re going to execute on.”
“That’s why you’ve seen the executive orders, the way he’s gone through the Supreme Court, and by the way the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">other 102 judges</span> that we’re eventually going to pick,” he said.
“It’s just methodical, and that’s what the mainstream media won’t report. Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign, and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what’s going on today, because we have a team that’s just grinding it through on what President Donald Trump promised the American people. The mainstream media had better understand something: all of those promises are going to be implemented,” Bannon promised.
Priebus said the most urgent task for the administration was confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He explained:
Number One, we’re not talking about a change over a four-year period. We’re talking about a change of potentially forty years of law. But more important than that, it established trust. It established that President Trump is a man of his word. We always knew that. But when he said here’s twenty names on a piece of paper back in July, remember, and he said, ‘I’m going to pick my judge out of these twenty people that are on this piece of paper,’ and he did it — that’s number one, because Neil Gorsuch represents a conservative, represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump, and it fulfills the promise that he made to all of you, and to all Americans across the country.
Priebus said the second item on the president’s agenda was deregulation. He argued that Trump hasn’t been given enough credit for imposing a consistent process of deregulation by ordering that “for every regulation presented for passage, that Cabinet secretary has to identify two that that person would eliminate.”
The third priority identified by Priebus was immigration — “protecting the sovereignty of the United States, putting a wall on the southern border, making sure that criminals are not part of our process.”
“These are all things that eight percent of Americans agree with, and these are all things that President Trump is doing within thirty days,” he declared.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Bannon divided the White House agenda into three categories: national security, economic nationalism, and the deconstruction of the administrative state.</span> He said:
I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdrawal from TPP. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The people in the mainstream media don’t get this, but we’re already working in consultation with the Hill, people are starting to think through a whole raft of amazing and innovative bilateral relationships, bilateral trading relationships with people that will reposition America in the world as a fair trading nation, and start to bring jobs — high value added manufacturing jobs — back to the United States of America.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The rule of law is going to exist, when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration,” he stated, linking the president’s trade positions with national security.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said the defense budget and Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s plan for defeating ISIS would also be part of that imperative.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Bannon made the interesting point that business leaders have been telling the White House that slashing regulations is at least as important as cutting taxes to get the economy moving faster.
</span>“If you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason, and that is the deconstruction — the way the progressive left runs is that if they can’t get it passed, they’re just going to put it in some kind of regulation in an agency. That’s all going to be deconstructed, and that’s why I think this regulatory thing is so important,” he said.
Schlapp brought the conversation back to media coverage of the new administration. Priebus said he thought there was hope for improvement.
“I”m personally so conditioned to hearing about why President Trump isn’t going to win the election, why a controversy in the primary is going to take down President Trump; I lived through it as chairman of the party,” he said, recalling his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee during <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 election</span>.
“It really hit me because it was maybe the summer <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span> and you remember the media was constantly pounding President Trump, and the polling kept getting better and better for President Trump. But it was when I went home and got out of this town, and I went back to Kenosha, and I talked to my neighbor. And I said, ‘Bob, what do you think?’ He goes, ‘Man, I really love that Trump.’ I said, ‘Sandy, what do you think?’ ‘We’re for Trump.’”
“You all lived through it too, because you all had different people you were for, but you kept running into your neighbors, and you kept running into people that you know, and what did they keep telling you? They kept telling you, ‘Trump, Trump, Trump,’” he said, unintentionally sparking a chant of the president’s name from the audience. He said it was clear the country was hungry for something much bigger than a single issue campaign, or a modest course correction from the previous administration.
Bannon took his turn at the microphone to disagree with Priebus about whether media coverage of the Trump administration would improve. He argued that it was likely to get worse.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">“They’re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,” Bannon argued, recalling how that message resonated everywhere from previous CPAC appearances by Trump to small town hall meetings.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">He predicted media coverage would therefore get worse as Trump continues to “press his agenda, and as economic conditions get better, more jobs get better, they’re going to continue to fight.”</span> Bannon warned:
If you think they’re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. Every day it is going to be a fight, and that is what I’m proudest about Donald Trump. All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to moderate.’ Every day in the Oval Office he tells Reince and I, ‘I commited this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I’m going to deliver on this.’
Priebus stressed the importance of Republicans sticking together through the coming years.
“I think what you’ve got is an incredible opportunity to use this victory that President Trump and all of us, and you, and everyone that made this happen put together, and work together, continue to communicate,” he said, adding:
Some of the core principles of President Trump are very similar to those of Ronald Reagan. When you look at peace through strength and building up the military — I mean, how many times have you heard President Trump say, ‘I’m going to build up the military, I’m going to take care of the vets, I’m going to make sure that we don’t have a Navy that’s decimated and planes that are nowhere to be found?’ Peace through strength. Deregulation. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">You think about the economy and the economic boom that was created.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Some of it is going to take a little time — to get the jobs back, to get more money in people’s pockets.</span> Those things are going to happen. In the meantime, we have to stick together and make sure that we’ve got President Trump for eight years. He’s somebody that we know that we’re going to be very proud of as these things get done. But it’s going to take all of us working together to make it happen.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bannon saw a “new political order” continuing to take shape, noting that populists, limited-government conservatives, libertarians, and economic nationalists could be found in the CPAC audience.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“We have wide and sometimes divergent opinions, but I think the center core of what we believe — that we’re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being,” he said.</span> “I think that’s what unites us, and I think that is what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”
“We’re at the top of the first inning on this. It’s going to take just as much fight, just as much focus, and just as much determination, and the one thing I’d like to leave you guys today with is that we want you to have our back … but more importantly, hold us accountable. Hold us accountable to what we promised, hold us accountable for delivering on what we promised.”
Modertor Matt Schlapp, in acknowledgment of the unique nature of their joint appearance, asked the Honorable Gentlemen what they appreciated about one another.
Priebus lauded Bannon for being “very dogged in ensuring that every day, the promises that President Trump has made are the promises that we’re working on,” for being “incredibly loyal,” and for being “extremely consistent.”
“As you can imagine, there are many things hitting the president’s ear and desk every day, different things that come to the president that want to move him off his agenda, and Steve is very consistent and very loyal to the agenda, and is a presence that I think is very important to have in the White House,” he said. He added that he thought of Bannon as a dear and cherished friend.
“I can run a little hot on occasions,” Bannon allowed. “And Reince is indefatigable. It’s low key, but it’s determination. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The thing I respect most, and the only way this thing works, is Reince is always kind of steady … his job is by far one of the toughest jobs I’ve ever seen in my life.”

Stock markets globally were lower as high Chinese inflation reduced the chances of further monetary easing
Violence in Hong Kong triggered the largest drop in local stocks since August on Monday, while concerns around U.S.-China trade negotiations continue to weigh on global markets.
</span>Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng benchmark closed <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 2.6%,</span> the fourth-biggest drop of the year, after police fired gunshots at protesters, and demonstrations across the city forced schools and offices to close early.

</span>“It’s very concerning today,” said Weiqi Zhu, a fund manager at Gao Zheng Asset Management, adding that political uncertainty was putting off investment in Hong Kong. “The violence is up to another stage now.”

92586,"<h3>First Futures Contract to Pay Out in Bitcoin Poised for Green Light</h3>Intercontinental Exchange project is aimed at institutional investors wary of murky cryptocurrency markets

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:30 am ET

WASHINGTON—The first futures contract that will pay out in cryptocurrency rather than cash is expected to soon get regulatory approval.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The contract, launched by New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE -1.13%decrease; red down pointing triangle is aimed at institutional players who have stayed out of cryptocurrency markets out of concerns that they are unregulated and susceptible to manipulation.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Bitcoin futures allow investors to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency.</span> Other bitcoin-futures contracts exist but they pay out in dollars.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The effort has received backing from major corporations such as Microsoft Corp. and Starbucks Corp., which have the longer-term goal of making cryptocurrency transparent and regulated enough to allow customers to use it for retail purchases, such as a Starbucks latte.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Once digital assets have more trust and regulation, people will be more comfortable using digital assets as currency,” said Kelly Loeffler, chief executive of the ICE cryptocurrency business, dubbed Bakkt (pronounced “backed”).

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Following an extraordinary run-up in bitcoin prices last year, CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange company, and Cboe Global Markets Inc., operator of the biggest U.S. options exchange, both launched futures on the cryptocurrency in December.

</span>Since then, the outlook for the cryptocurrency has dimmed considerably. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">After peaking <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $20,000 last</span> December, bitcoin’s price has dropped by <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 80%.</span></span> Federal regulators are investigating possible manipulation in bitcoin markets, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

The CME and Cboe futures contracts were seen as a big step forward for the once-fringe asset gaining wider acceptance on Wall Street. Both of those contracts settle in cash, meaning that owners receive U.S. dollars rather than bitcoin when the futures contract ends.

“It’s great to have cash-settled, but there’s a need for physical delivery” of bitcoin, Ms. Loeffler said.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">ICE has been working with regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the past several months to make sure its business plan complies with CFTC regulations.</span> The project will require an exemption from the agency to allow it to hold on to customers’ bitcoins, since CFTC statutes are written to account for cash, securities, and agricultural commodities such as wheat or coffee.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">ICE and regulators also had to sort out major cybersecurity issues, both in terms of preventing attacks and the financial liability for lost assets if a hack occurs.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">CFTC staff is currently reviewing ICE’s business plan.</span> CFTC commissioners will likely vote on whether to approve the project early <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> after which the public will <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 30 days</span> to weigh in.

Bakkt is not ICE’s first foray into cryptocurrencies. The exchange giant has an investment in Coinbase, a San Francisco-based provider of “wallet” services that is one of the leading cryptocurrency businesses. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In January, ICE also announced it was teaming up with startup Blockstream to start a service that would bring bitcoin data to hedge funds and other professional trading firms.

68468,"<h3>Kushner arrives at Senate for closed-door questioning on Russia</h3>Jared Kushner, President Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, walked into Senate offices Monday morning to begin answering questions behind closed doors about his contacts with Russian officials.
In written remarks made public prior to his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Kushner denies any improper contacts or collusion. The 11-page statement by Kushner details four meetings he had with Russian officials during <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span> and transition period — including one set up by Donald Trump Jr. with a Russian lawyer.
Kushner defends his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and other Russian officials as typical contacts in his role as the Trump campaign’s liaison to foreign governments, according to the prepared statement he plans to submit for the record.
Kushner is answering questions behind closed doors, first to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday and then again on Tuesday to the House Intelligence Committee. Both panels are probing Russian interference in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 election</span> and contacts between Russia and Trump campaign officials and associates.
[Read Kushner’s prepared statement]
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government orchestrated a far-reaching campaign to meddle with last year’s presidential campaign and influence the outcome in Trump’s favor.
Kushner’s appearances before congressional committees mark a new phase in the investigations of Russian meddling, as he is the first of the president’s closest advisers to appear before them.
In his testimony, which will be submitted to the congressional committees before he answers questions from lawmakers, Kushner says he has had only “limited contacts” with Russian representatives and denies any wrongdoing.
“I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Kushner writes. “I had no improper contacts. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector.”
</span>Kushner portrays himself as a goal-oriented task master new to presidential politics who assumed increasingly important responsibilities on a fast-paced campaign in which decisions were made “on the fly,” including serving as the main point of contact for foreign government officials.
Kushner writes that his first meeting with a Russian official was in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2016 at</span> the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Trump delivered a major foreign policy speech, the execution of which Kushner says he oversaw. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Kushner writes that he attended a reception to thank the event’s host, Dimitri Simes, publisher of the National Interest, a foreign policy magazine.</span> Simes introduced Kushner to four ambassadors at the reception, including Kislyak, Kushner says.
“With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy,” Kushner writes. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies.</span> I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.”
Kushner does not name the other three ambassadors he met at the reception.
Kushner denies having had any other contact with Kislyak during the campaign, disputing a report by Reuters that he had two phone calls with the ambassador.
“While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador,” Kushner writes. “We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place.”
In fact, Kushner goes on to note that on Nov.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span> the day after the election, when the campaign received a congratulatory note from Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kushner tried to verify it was real and could not remember Kislyak’s name. “So I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, ‘What is the name of the Russian ambassador?’ ” Kushner writes.
Kushner also describes attending a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2016 meeting</span> organized by his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr., with a Russian attorney. He says it was listed on his calendar as “Meeting: Don Jr. | Jared Kushner.” He writes that he arrived at the meeting late, and when he got there the Russian lawyer was talking about a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.
“I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting,” Kushner writes. “Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 or</span> so minutes and wrote, ‘Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.’ <span id=""4"" class=""red"">”
Kushner writes that he received a “random email” on Oct.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> from a screen name “Guccifer400,” which he interpreted as “a hoax” that was “an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">him 52 bitcoins</span> in exchange for not publishing that information.”
</span>Kushner says he brought the email to the attention of a Secret Service agent he was traveling with, who advised him “to ignore it and not to reply — which is what I did.”
Kushner also details two interactions with Russian officials during the transition period, before Trump was sworn in as president on Jan.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20.</span> The first, on Dec.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> was a meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower in New York, which retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who would become the president’s national security adviser, also attended.
“I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations,” Kushner writes. “Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.”
Kushner writes that Kislyak addressed U.S. policy in Syria and wanted to “convey information from what he called his ‘generals’ ” but that they could not come to the United States and “he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation.”
Kushner continues that he or Flynn explained there were no such lines, and that Kushner asked Kislyak if the Russians had “an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn.” He writes that Kislyak said “that would not be possible” and they agreed to wait until after the inauguration to receive the information.
The Washington Post first reported in May on Kushner and Kislyak’s discussions about establishing a secret communications channel, though Kushner suggests in his testimony that the channel would have been for the purpose of this one meeting as opposed to establishing a “secret back channel.”
“I did not suggest a ‘secret back channel,’ ” Kushner writes. “I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period.”
The second transition-period meeting Kushner says he had with Russians was on Dec.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> when Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, a banker with “a direct line to the Russian President,” at the urging of Kislyak. On Dec.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span> the Russian Embassy asked Kushner to meet with Kislyak on Dec.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span> and Kushner declined, he writes. They asked if he could meet on Dec.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 and</span> Kushner declined again, he writes. Kislyak then requested a meeting with Kushner’s assistant — “and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed,” Kushner writes.
Kislyak and Kushner’s assistant, whom Kushner does not name in his testimony, met on Dec.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span> where Kislyak requested that Kushner meet with Gorkov, “who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.”
Kushner agreed to meet Gorkov, making room in his schedule for him the next day. Their meeting <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lasted 20 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25 minutes</span>, Kushner writes, and Gorkov presented two gifts — a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where Kushner’s grandparents were from in Belarus, and a bag of dirt from there. Kushner then gave the gifts to his assistant and asked him to formally register them with the transition office.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">During the meeting, Kushner writes, Gorkov told him about his bank and discussed the Russian economy, expressing “disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future.”</span> Kushner writes that “no specific policies were discussed,” including sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.
At the end of his testimony, Kushner offers an explanation for failing to disclose all of his foreign government contacts on his SF-86 application for security clearance. He writes that his form was “prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Kushner describes a frenzied period disentangling from his real estate business and moving his family to Washington during which a “rough draft” of his form was submitted by his assistant because of a “miscommunication.”</span> Kushner writes that the initial submission omitted “all foreign contacts” and that a supplemental submission disclosed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 contacts</span> from more <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 countries</span>."
30666,"<h3>Driven By Consumers, U.S. Inflation Grows More Persistent</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation is showing signs of entering a more stubborn phase that will likely require drastic action by the Federal Reserve, a shift that has panicked financial markets and heightens the risks of a recession.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Some of the longtime drivers of higher inflation — spiking gas prices, supply chain snarls, soaring used-car prices — are fading.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet underlying measures of inflation are actually worsening.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The ongoing evolution of the forces behind an inflation rate that's near a four-decade high has made it harder for the Fed to wrestle it under control.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Prices are no longer rising because a few categories have skyrocketed in cost.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Instead, inflation has now spread more widely through the economy, fueled by a strong job market that is boosting paychecks, forcing companies to raise prices to cover higher labor costs and giving more consumers the wherewithal to spend.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">On Tuesday, the government said inflation ticked <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.1% from</span> July to August <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8.3% from</span> a year ago, which was down from June's four-decade high of 9.1%
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">But excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices jumped by an unexpectedly <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sharp 0.6% from</span> July to August, after a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">milder 0.3% rise</span> the previous month.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Fed monitors core prices closely, and the latest figures heightened fears of an even more aggressive Fed and sent stocks plunging, with the Dow Jones collapsing more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,200 points</span>.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The core price figures solidified worries that inflation has now spread into all corners of the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“One of the most remarkable things is how broad-based the price gains are,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">""The underlying trend in inflation certainly has not shown any progress toward moderating so far.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And that should be a worry to the Fed because the price gains have become increasingly demand-driven, and therefore likely to be more persistent.”
Demand-driven inflation is one way to say that consumers, who account for <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 70% of</span> economic growth, keep spending, even if they resent having to pay more.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">In part, that is because of widespread income gains and in part because many Americans still have more savings than they did before the pandemic, after having postponed spending on vacations, entertainment, and restaurants.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">When inflation is driven mainly by demand, it can require more drastic action from the Fed than when it's driven mainly by supply shocks, such as an oil supply disruption, which can often resolve on their own.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Economists fear that the only way for the Fed to slow robust consumer demand is to raise interest rates so high as to sharply increase unemployment and potentially cause a recession.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Typically, as fear of layoffs rises, not only do the jobless reduce spending.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">So, too, do the many people who fear losing their jobs.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Some economists now think the Fed will have to raise its benchmark short-term rate much higher, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.5% or</span> above, by early next year, more than previous estimates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4%.</span></span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">(The Fed’s key rate is now in a range <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.25% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.5%.</span>)</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Higher rates from the Fed would, in turn, lead to higher costs for mortgages, auto loans and business loans.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point next week for a third consecutive time.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Tuesday's inflation report even led some analysts to speculate that the central bank could announce a full percentage point hike.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">If it did, that would amount to the largest increase since the Fed began using short-term rates in the early 1990s to guide consumer and business borrowing.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even though headline inflation barely rose last month, underlying inflation, which reflects broader economic trends, worsened.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">A measure that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland uses to track median inflation, which essentially ignores categories with the biggest price swings, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.7% in</span> August.</span> That was the biggest monthly increase since records began <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1983.</span>
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Higher prices have yet to cause much of what economists call “demand destruction” — a pullback in spending that could quell inflation.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Though higher gas prices have caused Americans to drive less, there isn't much evidence of significant cutbacks elsewhere.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices, for example, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 0.9% in</span> August and have <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 8% in</span> the past year.</span> But that hasn't noticeably discouraged people from going out. Restaurant traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels on Open Table, an app that tracks reservations, and was still increasing into September.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Overall, consumers have largely kept up their spending, even with rampant inflation, though perhaps through gritted teeth.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">In July, spending <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.2% after</span> adjusting for higher prices.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The spread of inflation into services, such as rental costs and health care, largely reflects the impact of higher wages.</span> Hospitals and doctors' offices have to pay more for nurses and other staff. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">And as more Americans find jobs or get raises, they're able to move out from family homes or split from roommates.</span> Rental costs have <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6.7% in</span> the past year, the most <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1986.</span>
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Wages and salaries <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 6.7% in</span> August from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's wage tracker, the biggest increase in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40 years</span>.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">And Luzzetti noted that the same data shows a record wage premium for people who switch jobs, compared with those who stay put.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">That means employers are still offering big raises to try to fill jobs.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">Economists had hoped that rising services prices would be offset by falling costs for goods such as new and used cars, furniture, and clothing, after those items spiked in the pandemic.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">As supply chain backups improved, a better flow of such goods were expected to bring prices down.
</span>Yet so far, that hasn't happened.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">“We’ve seen shipping costs come down, we’ve seen supply chain congestion ease a little bit, production has improved and inventories have risen,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">“So all of that suggests some supply side improvement.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">And yet companies are still putting through large price increases for those goods, and that’s problematic.”
</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">Such trends could renew the debate over how much corporations' ability to raise prices has been fueled by a lack of competition, a phenomenon referred to as “greedflation.”</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">But most economists attribute the ability of companies to still charge more to consumers' willingness to pay.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">“It appears that retailers are now raising prices because they can, not because they have to.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Consumer demand is still too strong,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, an investment bank, in a research note.</span>"

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">A year ago, buying the median American home at prevailing rates meant a monthly mortgage bill of <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1,223 after</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% down</span> payment, according to calculations by George Ratiu, an economist at Realtor.com.</span> At recent rates, such a purchase would require a monthly payment of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $1,700</span>—<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 38% increase</span>, he estimated.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Even compared with searing inflation elsewhere in the economy, that counts as extraordinary price growth.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It also strikes at the bedrock of many families’ finances, Mr. Ratiu said.</span> “Most Americans who buy a home are in a sense making the biggest purchase of their lives,” he said.
Some hopeful homeowners are paying more up front to sidestep higher rates.
The home Sam Skinner is having built in Delaware is set to be completed in the middle of the summer. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In late February, he decided to pay <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $6,000 to</span> lock in a rate <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.875% with</span> Wells Fargo to avoid being stuck with what he believed would be a notably higher interest rate in July or August.
</span>“I’m a very risk averse person, so no way was I going to sit here stressing about rates while the house is being built, not knowing how much our payments would be,” Mr. Skinner said.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Though rising rates have made buying more expensive, the housing market has remained tight.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 19.2% in</span> the year that ended in January.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Interest rates are rising elsewhere in the economy too, lifted by the Fed’s plans to raise benchmark overnight-lending costs and draw down its support for bond markets.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">In doing so, the Fed aims to bring demand into balance with supply, chilling upward pressure on prices.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The central bank is responding to inflation that has now reached its highest pace in four decades.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The government said Tuesday that March’s consumer-price index <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.5% year</span> over year, as costs soared for energy, food and airfare.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">With unemployment nearly back to prepandemic levels and close to all-time lows, Fed officials have called fighting inflation their priority.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As the bank’s policy shifts, much of the fallout plays out far from the view of everyday people, such as through higher financing costs for corporations and muted investment incentives for money managers.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Rising mortgage rates, on the other hand, literally hit home.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Financing property was cheap for much of the pandemic.</span> The 30-year rate was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 3% for</span> more than half <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span></span> In January of that year, it had hit an all-time low <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.65%.</span>
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Those rates helped fuel the biggest boom in sales of previously-owned homes <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006.</span></span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Freed by remote work and lured by inexpensive financing, families left apartments in New York, San Francisco and other metropolises for more spacious suburban houses.</span> Growing ranks of millennials—many starting families and entering their prime home-buying years—joined the crowd of bidders too.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Now, bankers and economists say that pricier mortgages are cooling the market.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index tracking the volume of loan applications for home buying was <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 6% this</span> week from a year earlier, the trade group said Wednesday.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Wells Fargo, which issued more mortgages than any other U.S. bank <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2021,</span> said Thursday that mortgage originations <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 27% from</span> a year ago.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">JPMorgan Chase, another big home lender, reported Wednesday that its mortgage originations <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 37%.</span>
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Refinancings have crashed as higher rates cut the share of homeowners who can save money with a fresh mortgage.</span> The MBA’s index for refinancing volume is <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 62% from</span> a year ago.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Across all mortgage types, the group’s economists project originations will <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fall 36% this</span> year <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $2.58 trillion</span>.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Eugene Richards IV, a loan officer with mortgage brokerage Spruce Mortgage in Burlington, Vt., said people shopping for homes are seeing their budgets upended—especially first-time buyers.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Higher mortgage rates have also practically eliminated refinancing activity among the firm’s clients.
</span>“I’ve definitely had some borrowers see the rate and be like, ‘Whoa! We need to talk,'” Mr. Richards said.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">As rates rise, the local real-estate market is showing signs of cooling off, Mr. Richards added, noting that pricier mortgages are thinning the pool of qualified buyers.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Other rates on money lent to individuals, like credit-card interest, are rising as well this year, but few are climbing as fast as mortgages.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates tend to follow closely the yield on the 10-year Treasury note—a practically risk-free government bond whose price reflects investors’ guesses about economic growth and central-bank policy over the next decade.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Since January, inflation’s persistence has convinced many investors that the Fed will act much more aggressively to rein in demand.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">In response, traders have sold off Treasury bonds this year, lifting yields, which rise when prices fall.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.12 percentage</span> point to close <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.808%,</span> a new high for the past year.</span> That’s up <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1.496% at</span> the end <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021.</span></span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates have ascended in sync.

18401,"<h3>Share of Americans With Health Insurance Declined in 2018</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Fewer Americans are living in poverty, but for the first time in years, more of them lack health insurance.
</span><span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 27.5 million</span> people, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 8.5 percent</span> of the population, lacked health insurance for all <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018,</span> up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.9 percent</span> the year before, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. It was the first increase since the Affordable Care Act passed <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> and experts said it was at least partly the result of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine that law.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The growth in the ranks of the uninsured was particularly striking because the economy was doing well.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The same report showed the share of Americans living in poverty fell <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 11.8 percent</span>, the lowest level <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001,</span> and household incomes edged up to their highest level on record.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The decline in health coverage reverses improvements since the Affordable Care Act established new insurance markets and financial assistance for millions of Americans who had previously struggled to obtain insurance.</span> Before the passage of the law, more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 percent</span> of Americans lacked coverage.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It’s very frightening in that if this is happening now with unemployment <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3.7 percent</span>, then what’s going to happen when the employer coverage situation gets worse?” said Eliot Fishman, a senior director at the consumer group Families USA and a top Medicaid official in the Obama administration.</span> “There’s a fear we could see really dramatic increases in the uninsured rate if that happens.”
Surveys consistently show that health care is one of the top concerns for voters heading into <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span>. And candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, several of whom have promised to extend health insurance to all Americans, are sure to use Tuesday’s figures as evidence that the current system is not working.
Several of them, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., blamed President Trump’s health care policies for the higher uninsured rate on Tuesday.
The Census Bureau report also had good news for the White House. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Poorer households experienced the strongest income gains, a significant reversal after decades of rising inequality and a sign that the recovery is at last delivering income gains to middle-class and low-income families.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The report is the latest evidence that the strong job market is creating opportunities for a wide array of workers, said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“You’re seeing improvements in employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">You’re seeing improvements in employment outcomes for the formerly incarcerated,” Mr. Strain said.</span> “These workers who are potentially more vulnerable, you’re seeing the recovery reach them.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Democrats, however, are likely to highlight evidence that income gains have slowed since President Barack Obama’s final years in office.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Median income <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 5.1 percent</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.1 percent</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> compared with less <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 percent</span> last year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while Tuesday’s report showed the benefits of what now ranks as the longest economic expansion on record, it also highlighted the limitations of that growth.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Median household income is only modestly higher now than when the recession began in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2007 and</span> is essentially unchanged since the dot-com bubble burst <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">David Howell, a professor of economics and public policy at the New School in New York, said economic growth in recent years had helped families recover from recession, but had done little to reverse the longer-run stagnation in middle-class incomes.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Democrats and Republicans alike, he said, have tapped into the sense among many voters that the economy is not working for them.
</span>“If you look at the long-run trajectory <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1979,</span> it’s pretty disastrous,” Mr. Howell said.
Health insurance
The drop in insurance coverage <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 is</span> relatively small compared with the long-term trend, but it suggests that policy changes under the Trump administration, which has been hostile to the health law, have made a difference.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The administration cut back on advertising and enrollment assistance, programs that helped low-income people learn about the new insurance programs, among other changes that may have depressed the number of people signing up for health plans.</span> The government also announced that it might begin counting Medicaid enrollment as a strike against immigrants who are seeking green cards or citizenship — a policy that became final this year. Insurance coverage for Americans of Hispanic origin fell last year, according to the report.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The administration’s decision <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 to</span> eliminate a subsidy program contributed to large price increases for health insurance in the Obamacare marketplaces in many parts of the country the next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Research from the Department of Health and Human Services shows that more than a million Americans who were previously buying their own insurance left the market <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span>
</span>But the Census Bureau figures show that the main change in the uninsured rate came from declines in Medicaid coverage. Urged by the administration, which expressed concerns about the program’s integrity, several states started asking families to prove their eligibility for Medicaid more often <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span> The number of Americans covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program fell by more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1.6 million</span> last year, according to administrative data.
“If you increase red tape you are going to lose people, many of whom are actually eligible for the coverage,” said Joan Alker, a research professor at Georgetown University. She said she was particularly disheartened to see declines in the number of children with health insurance.
But Brian Blase, a former special assistant to Mr. Trump for health care policy, pointed to a recent study suggesting that some Americans who had enrolled in Medicaid in the early years of Obamacare were not eligible for it.
“My sense is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 states</span> probably started tightening eligibility,” said Mr. Blase, who is now president of the consulting and research firm Blase Policy Strategies.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">As part of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 tax</span> law, Congress abolished Obamacare’s so-called individual mandate, which required most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a fine.</span> Technically, the change did not kick in until this year. But analysts believe publicity about the provision may have led fewer people to seek coverage.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Historically, health coverage has tended to increase when the economy grows, since most Americans get insurance through employers.</span> Indeed, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 2018,</span> the uninsured rate had not risen in any year <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Income and poverty
Income gains have slowed substantially as the economic expansion has matured.</span> But the tepid progress in top-line numbers hides positive trends under the surface.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“You continue to see some progress for households <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span> especially in the bottom of the income distribution as they benefited from a tighter economy,” said Jason Furman, who was chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“But the pace of that progress seems to have slowed relative to past years.”
Median household income, the level at which half of households make more money and half make less, rose to <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $63,200 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 from</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $62,600 the</span> year before.</span> The change was so small that it was not statistically important. The Census Bureau made major tweaks to its methodology <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> making comparisons to earlier years difficult; by some estimates, household incomes remain below <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 1999 peak</span>.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some of the pullback in income gains was to be expected.</span> Increases earlier in the recovery were driven by people returning to work; for example, households where only one person worked outside the home might have become two-earner homes.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Now, with the unemployment rate near a five-decade low, household income gains must rely more heavily on raises for existing employees, said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI.
</span>At an individual level, pay did climb by some measures. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Among full-time, year-round workers, inflation-adjusted earnings rose more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 percent</span> for both men and women.
</span>And as some workers take home fatter paychecks, it is helping to even out inequality, if only slightly. Incomes grew more for poorer households last year, adjusted for household size. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Poverty fell for households with children headed by women, and the black poverty rate was the lowest ever reported — though it is still more than double the white poverty rate.
</span>There has been a “theme of the recovery finally seeping down to the most marginal workers and families in America,” and “you see that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span>” Mr. Tedeschi said.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The report’s income statistics are pretax, so they do not directly reflect Mr. Trump’s tax cut package, which took effect last year.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Tax Foundation has estimated that richer households probably saw the greatest decrease in taxes because of the changes.
</span>A separate report this week, from the Government Accountability Office, found that wealthy Americans were far more likely to live to old age than their poorer neighbors. Other recent research has found that gap has been growing.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Altogether,<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 38 million</span> people were living in poverty.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The poverty rate has fallen relatively steadily <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> when it <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 15 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Among children, the poverty rate <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 16.2 percent</span>, also down <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2017.</span></span>
</span>The Trump administration applauded that progress.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">Pro-worker policies are “unleashing the private sector and achieving historical gains for the most disadvantaged Americans,” Tomas J. Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">But a broader measure that is often preferred by economists tells a less positive story.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">The headline poverty figures count the number of people living in households that earn below a certain threshold: <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20,000 for</span> a family of three <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">A supplementary poverty rate, which takes into account regional differences in the cost of living and government benefits such as housing assistance and the earned-income tax credit, <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 13.1 percent</span> <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span></span> little changed <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2017.</span></span></span> More seniors and fewer children are poor under that measure.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Government programs, particularly Social Security, the earned-income tax credit and the nutrition-assistance program formerly known as food stamps, kept tens of millions of people out of poverty, the report noted.</span>"
68135,"<h3>Guatemala elects right-wing president amid dismal turnout</h3>GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemalans on Sunday elected Alejandro Giammattei as their next president. When he takes office Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span> he will inherit a nation plagued by years of political scandal, where a recent surge in migration has laid bare the monumenta l challenges ahead.
Giammattei, the right-wing Vamos party candidate who is a former prisons director, beat out former first lady Sandra Torres for the next four-year term. The presidential runoff election came at a crucial moment — as Guatemala prepares for the possible implementation of a “safe third country” agreement with the United States, a plan touted by the Trump administration but with potentially grave consequences for a country whose own citizens are fleeing in droves.
Guatemala is the leading country of origin of migrants and asylum seekers apprehended at the U.S. southern border.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">During his campaign, Giammattei outlined his plan to keep people from wanting to leave, pledging to build an “economic wall” through job creation.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The country’s significant inequality and the abject poverty in rural areas have gone mostly unaddressed since Guatemala’s civil war, which ended <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996.</span></span> The current exodus reflects the loss of hope for many of Guatemala’s poorest.
“We will focus on the construction of a different Guatemala,” Giammattei said when he proclaimed himself president-elect while results were still coming in.
With more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 99 percent</span> of votes counted, he held nearly a 16-point lead. Turnout was dismal. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 42 percent</span> of the country’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.15 million</span> registered voters participated, far less than <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 56 percent</span> in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 presidential</span> runoff election.
In the lead-up to this year’s general election, two of the top three contenders were barred from running mid-campaign, and another candidate was arrested in the United States on drug trafficking and weapons charges. Legal battles to bar candidates, especially former attorney general and anti-corruption crusader Thelma Aldana, were widely considered politically motivated.
No candidate in a field <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 19 obtained</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50 percent</span> of the vote in June, prompting the runoff between centrist National Unity of Hope party candidate Torres, who had come in first, and Giammattei, who had placed second.
The subsequent campaign was uninspiring, according to José Carlos Sanabria, a political analyst at the Association for Research and Social Studies.
“Broadly speaking, in many regards, the campaign was characterized by its weakness. It was a campaign without much depth in terms of proposals or an in-depth discussion of plans for government,” Sanabria said.
“The apathy, disinterest and disenchantment of many citizens toward the candidates and parties is quite high,” he said.
Outgoing President Jimmy Morales came into office in the wake of mass protests against corruption and the resignation and arrest of his predecessor, Otto Pérez Molina. But hopes generated by his anti-corruption platform would lead to disappointment. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">After a United Nations-backed commission began investigating Morales for illegal campaign financing, he moved to shut down the commission, whose mandate expires next month.
</span>Concerns about impunity within the next administration linger. Giammattei was prosecuted for extrajudicial executions after police killed seven inmates when he was director of Guatemala’s prison system. The case continues to cast a long shadow despite his acquittal.
Torres and her party have been accused of corruption and mismanagement. She has denied those accusations, but is likely to face prosecution as soon as the election process is formally over and she loses her immunity from prosecution as a candidate.
Misrael Cardenas,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> said he did not vote. He sells rat poison, used shoes and assorted knickknacks on a street corner in Guatemala City.
“We have to work,” he said. “If we don’t work, we don’t eat.”
Cardenas said he hopes the next president will set the country straight. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Unemployment, poverty and violence are huge problems, he said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Poverty and violence are the main reasons Guatemalans identify as reasons for fleeing the country.
</span>Instead of helping to address the root causes of the exodus, the U.S. government is pushing its policies of crackdowns and restrictions on asylum seekers onto Mexico, Guatemala and beyond, said Mike Allison, a political science professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania.
“U.S. policy toward Guatemala is shortsighted,” he said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The current administration is looking for immediate gratification at no financial cost.”
</span>Last month, Morales’s government signed an immigration deal with the Department of Homeland Security that would force Hondurans, Salvadorans and others transiting Guatemala to seek asylum there instead of in the United States.
The agreement was met with protests and widespread condemnation in Guatemala, as well as criticism from U.S. Democrats and migrant rights groups.
Giammattei criticized the circumstances of the negotiations by an outgoing government, and Torres rejected the notion that Guatemala is a safe country. Once in office, the next president would have the power to overturn the agreement, but neither candidate has promised to do so.
The deal remains in limbo. Guatemala’s highest court issued a provisional injunction against its implementation, determining that it requires congressional approval. Court proceedings are ongoing.

70785,"<h3>The Fed and Rates: It’s the Pause that Refreshes</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Fed stayed on hold Wednesday, but remaining easy now could increase the central bank’s ability to tighten policy later

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 16,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 5</span>:14 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The latest fire in financial markets has only just gone out, and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday showed it has no interest in lighting another match.</span> Paradoxically, this may have made it easier, not harder, for it to tighten policy later this year.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed’s decision on Wednesday to leave rates on hold wasn’t that much of a surprise.</span> Markets had already surmised that recent turmoil would cause it to stand pat. So confirmation of this was a balm to stocks.

And the central bank gave a dovish message on where policy is heading. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">While acknowledging that the economy continues to chug along, the central bank pointed out that economic weakness overseas and shaky financial markets “continue to pose risks.”

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">But investors should consider this as part of the push and pull the Fed will have to undertake as it figures out how to move further away from the zero-interest-rate policy that held sway since the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While this doesn’t mean the Fed has lost its appetite for more rate increases, it shows that the path will be winding and strewed with pauses.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Underscoring the more hesitant approach, projections indicated that Fed policy makers now expect to vote through just two quarter-point increases to their target range on overnight rates <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Following the Fed’s December interest-rate increase—its first in nearly a decade—policy makers had been forecasting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 2016 could</span> see four rate rises.

</span>That prospect had contributed to the unease in global markets early in the year, building on concerns about China and plummeting commodities values. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">It had also caused the dollar to continue strengthening, which itself raised fears about emerging-market debt and the effect on U.S. exporters.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">With the Fed moderating its stance, investors moved their focus for further action to the year’s second half.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Whereas just prior to the Fed’s announcement futures markets had implied <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 66% chance</span> of the Fed tightening by its June meeting, those odds slipped <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 38% afterward</span>.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while stocks rose, U.S. Treasurys gained ground, pushing yields lower.</span> The dollar slipped as well as foreign exchange players factored in a smaller divergence between U.S. rates and overseas ones.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">So financial conditions got easier and the Fed’s big worry—that markets suddenly fall out of bed again—became a little less likely.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That, in turn, should make it easier for the Fed to get back to business later in the year.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the pause will likely help keep the U.S. economy, if not exactly humming, from downshifting.</span> And signs on that front are promising.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The U.S. job market keeps getting stronger, with Fed policy makers projecting the unemployment rate is on track to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 4.7% in</span> the fourth quarter.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">And inflation is picking up.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Labor Department on Wednesday said that its index of core consumer prices, which excludes food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, was <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 2.3% from</span> a year earlier for its strongest gain <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2012.</span></span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Core services prices, which are less affected by global developments, were <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.1% for</span> their strongest gain <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The upshot is that the Fed’s confidence in financial markets’ ability to stomach another rate increase—and in the economy’s ability to withstand another round of volatility if markets can’t hack it—has to be on the rise.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Investors may have thought the Fed took a June rate increase off the table on Wednesday, but in the process they may have raised the odds of it happening.

52545,"<h3>Qatar to withdraw from OPEC over feud with Saudi Arabia</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Qatar announced Monday that it will withdraw from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in January, as the Persian Gulf state faces a prolonged regional clash with rival Saudi Arabia.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Qatar framed the surprise decision, which ended nearly six decades of membership in OPEC, as a move to focus the country’s resources on exports of liquefied natural gas.</span> The decision also comes amid a more than year-long feud between Qatar and its neighbors. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Led by Saudi Arabia, a coalition of Arab Gulf states broke off relations with Qatar and imposed an economic and travel blockade in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017 after</span> accusing Qatar’s government of sponsoring terrorism.
</span>Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said in a news conference Monday that the decision was not related to the political clash and that Qatar was leaving the oil cartel to work on plans to boost its natural gas production by more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 percent</span> in the coming years.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“I think it’s inefficient to focus on something that is not your core business and something that is not going to benefit you long term,” he said.</span> “For me to put effort and resources and time in an organization where I am a very small player, and don’t have real say in what happens in that organization, practically does not work.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Though Qatar’s oil exports <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 600,000 barrels</span> a day are tiny compared to that of Saudi Arabia, which <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produces 11 million</span> barrels per day, Qatar’s exit from OPEC — the first by a Middle Eastern country — underscored the far-reaching consequences of the Persian Gulf feud.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Qatar is already the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.</span> Qatar Petroleum, the state-owned oil and gas company, said in a series of Twitter posts on Monday quoting Kaabi that it plans to develop and increase natural gas output <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 77 million</span> tons per year <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 110 million</span>.
“Achieving our ambitious growth strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts, commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar’s position as the leading natural gas producer,” Kaabi said.
Qatar also said that the government wants to increase its oil production, the Associated Press reported.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The regional boycott of Qatar has drawn in the Trump administration, which has close economic and military ties to all the countries embroiled in the feud.</span> But President Trump has issued conflicting statements about Qatar. He first endorsed the allegations that the country is a “sponsor of terrorism” last year but later called Qatari Emir Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani a “great friend” when the emir visited Washington in April. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged Persian Gulf leaders to resolve the conflict, emphasizing their shared aim of battling Sunni extremists in the region and in confronting Iran, a primary foreign policy goal for the Trump administration.
Senior U.S. officials, including Trump and Pompeo, offered a spirited defense of the Saudi government after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October by Saudi agents, in statements that have helped ease the kingdom’s international isolation and fueled speculation that the Trump administration would have added leverage with its Saudi allies to end the Persian Gulf conflict. But Qatar’s exit from OPEC on Monday — along with recent signs it is bolstering its military capacity, to counter its Gulf rivals — has made the prospects of a speedy end to the dispute appear dim.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">In recent months, American drivers have felt the effect of rising gas prices, with Trump attacking OPEC throughout the year for limiting production.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He has long pressured OPEC to lower oil prices and has used Twitter to criticize the organization.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">After peaking in October <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $86 per</span> barrel, Benchmark Brent crude is trading at more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $61 per</span> barrel.</span> OPEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group’s members are scheduled to meet this week to discuss potential cuts in production.
Five countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq and Venezuela — founded OPEC <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1960,</span> but the organization has grown <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15 member</span> nations. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The group coordinates policies to keep oil prices stable and to ensure a regular global supply.</span> But it also works with non-OPEC oil producers, including Russia, to set levels of production.

42538,"<h3>In Early February, the Coronavirus Was Moving Through New York</h3>A new study offers the first physical evidence that the coronavirus was circulating at low levels in New York City as early as the first week of February.
The city confirmed its first infection on <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 1.</span> Mathematical models have predicted that the virus was making its way through the city weeks before then, but the new report is the first to back the conjecture with testing data.
The study found that some New Yorkers had antibodies to the virus as early as the week ending Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23.</span> Given the time needed to produce antibodies, those people were most likely infected with the virus about two weeks earlier.
“You’re probably talking about very early in February,” said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who led the study. “It looks like there was at least low-level circulation.”
The findings were posted online Tuesday and have not yet been vetted by other scientists in a formal review, but several experts said the work was rigorous and credible, if not entirely surprising.
Genetic analyses have suggested that the virus entered the city several times early in the year, but most of those introductions died out and did not initiate the city’s epidemic.
“If I had to put a single date on it, based on current models, we had it as Feb.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19 as</span> the arrival that fueled things,” said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Dr. Krammer’s date is only slightly earlier, he noted.
The study also confirms estimates by epidemiologists working for New York State that roughly one in five New Yorkers had been exposed to the virus by late April, a figure broadly consistent with data released on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“I think it’s cool that we all have similar numbers,” Dr. Krammer said.
The similarity is even more striking, experts said, because the three studies all arrived at their estimates differently.
Dr. Krammer and his colleagues analyzed plasma samples from <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 5,500 patients</span> who went to Mount Sinai for routine medical appointments, were seen in its emergency department or were hospitalized from the week ending Feb.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9 through</span> the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>
The C.D.C. looked at blood samples from people who went in for routine medical exams, but only the week ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 1 for</span> New York City. The New York State study recruited people at supermarkets from <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19 to</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 28.</span>
“When we have three sources all giving you consistent results, that lends strength to all the findings,” said Eli Rosenberg, an epidemiologist at the State University of New York at Albany and lead author of the state study.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
The numbers from all three studies also agree on a crucial point: The vast majority of infections in New York City and elsewhere in the country went undiagnosed. Even in places with large outbreaks, the number of people exposed to the virus is still far from what is needed for herd immunity.
The Mount Sinai researchers grouped their samples in different ways and analyzed them using a lab-based antibody test that is highly accurate and specific to the new coronavirus.
Among people admitted to the emergency room or the hospital during the study period, the prevalence of antibodies rose to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 60 percent</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.2 percent</span>, the researchers found. These numbers are high because they include people who were severely ill with the coronavirus.
But among people who gave blood for routine appointments, or were admitted to the hospitals for reasons unrelated to the coronavirus — a group that represents the general population — fewer <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> of people had antibodies until the week ending <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29.</span> The rate rose exponentially after that, ending <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 19.3 percent</span> among patients seen in the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>
The team broke this latter group down further by the reason for their appointment, and found the increase in prevalence was mostly driven by pregnant women. Nearly one <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 pregnant</span> women had antibodies to the virus by the week of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span> and the number rose steadily to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 27 percent</span> by the week ending <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 19.</span></span></span>

What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 14 days</span>.

Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask?
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.” Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.

I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work?
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.

What is pandemic paid leave?
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gives 12 weeks</span> of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.

Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
</span>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 44 percent</span> of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” but she later walked back that statement.
-
What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.

How can I protect myself while flying?
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
-
What should I do if I feel sick?
If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
By comparison, people who came in for appointments related to surgery, cancer or cardiology plateaued at <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 9 percent</span>.
Subgroup analyses tend not to be reliable because of the smaller sample sizes, but this is a large study and the trends are intriguing, said Taia Wang, an immunologist at Stanford University.
“It does suggest the possibility that different groups of patients might have different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,” she said.
Experts were also struck by the relatively flat prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in blood samples from the first few weeks.
“I would expect during this time period, where people are not modifying their behavior, you’d get much closer to exponential growth,” Dr. Bedford said.
Other cities, like San Francisco, have similarly shown periods when the virus seemed to percolate until something — perhaps a superspreader event — triggered an exponential rise in infections.
“We’ve seen this elsewhere repeatedly, and it’s still strange to me,” Dr. Bedford said.
Dr. Krammer is continuing to track antibodies in blood samples and plans to do so for at least a year. But he said he would not expect the prevalence to rise much <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20 percent</span> in May or June, because infections in New York City had tapered off by then."
56377,"<h3>Thai Leader Yingluck Shinawatra Says Instability May Drag On</h3>Prime Minister Is Under Pressure as Demonstrators Plan Fresh Rallies

Updated Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 8</span>:09 am ET

BANGKOK—Yingluck Shinawatra still looks the part of Thailand's prime minister. Perched on a chair at the Venetian-Gothic government headquarters in Bangkok, she counts off her successes since thousands of opposition protesters last month launched a campaign to unseat her—chief of which is that she is still prime minister.

But in an interview with a group of visiting reporters Saturday, she conceded that Thailand's sometimes-violent political stalemate could rumble on for some time yet. ""This might not be finished soon,"" she said.

After a temporary truce to mark King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 86th birthday, antigovernment demonstrations are set to resume on Monday. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban is urging the people of Bangkok to take to the streets at the auspicious hour <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.39 a</span>.m.—the word for ""nine"" in Thai sounds like the term for ""step forward""—in another push to force Ms. Yingluck from office and, by extension, further trim the influence of her fugitive brother, former leader Thaksin Shinawatra.

Ms. Yingluck said that she is ready to dissolve parliament to pave the way for new elections which analysts say her party would likely win. But she stressed that the protesters' demands go beyond what's legally permissible in Thailand. In particular, their proposal for an unelected people's assembly would badly damage this Southeast Asian nation's already fragile democracy, and potentially hurt its ally the U.S.'s efforts to reassert its own influence in the region. ""We don't know how we can follow their offer. This isn't within the democratic process or in the constitution,"" she said.

On Sunday, she went further. In a televised address to the nation, she proposed a national referendum to determine her political future, and promised to step down if Thai voters wished her to do so.

Ms. Yingluck,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46 years</span> old, has faced down crises before. As soon as she was sworn into office after winning elections <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> she had to deal with some of the worst flooding the country has seen. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Broad swaths of Thailand's industrial regions were submerged, underscoring the importance of this up-and-coming economy to the rest of the world by disrupting global supply chains for everything from computer components to automobile electrical systems.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Diplomats and foreign business groups credited Ms. Yingluck with helping to revive investor confidence.

</span>She also managed to reach a behind-the-scenes rapprochement with the armed forces which ousted her brother, Mr. Thaksin, from power <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In return for maintaining the military's share of the national budget and keeping out of its annual reshuffles, the armed forces so far have largely steered clear of politics under Ms. Yingluck's term.

</span>But Ms. Yingluck has never quite been able to shake off the perception that her wealthy telecoms-mogul brother is pulling the strings of her government from overseas, where he has exiled himself to evade imprisonment on a corruption conviction he says was trumped-up to end his political career.

Those suspicions erupted with force in early November when the ruling Pheu Thai, or For Thais, Party pushed through an amnesty bill that would have enabled Mr. Thaksin to come back to Thailand without serving any prison time. Thousands of people took to streets in protest at what many called an attempt to whitewash Mr. Thaksin's alleged crimes.

Ms. Yingluck's government quickly backed down, but the demonstrators, led by Mr. Suthep, morphed into a broader campaign to root out any signs of Mr. Thaksin's influence in Thailand—and, especially, to remove the government of his sister.

This is partly the Shinawatras' own fault, analysts such as Pavin Chachavalpongpun at Kyoto University suggest. Before <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 election</span> campaign, Ms. Yingluck had no political experience. She worked as the chief executive at one of Mr. Thaksin's property companies. When Mr. Thaksin unveiled Ms. Yingluck as his election candidate, he described her as his clone, and their Pheu Thai Party campaigned on a telling slogan: ""Thaksin Thinks, Yingluck Does.""

In essence, it was a promise to return Thailand to the populist, pro-poor policies that rattled the country's traditional ruling hierarchies during Mr. Thaksin's term as prime minister, and which helped precipitate the coup that removed him <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span>

In some ways, the Yingluck administration's populism eclipses that of the original Thaksin brand.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">She introduced tax rebates for first-time buyers of homes and cars, and launched a multibillion-dollar rice-subsidy program that bought rice from farmers at up to double the market price.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Thailand incurs a loss of up <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 200 billion</span> baht ($6.22 billion) a year to run the program, but Ms. Yingluck's government is sticking with it despite criticism from the International Monetary Fund and others because it fulfills a campaign pledge to put more money into the hands of farmers.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">""People say we've spent a lot of money, but the objective is to help the poor people"" and reduce the gap between low and high-income groups in the country, Ms. Yingluck said in Saturday's interview.

</span>Her insistence on continuing with these free-spending policies infuriates many of her critics. Mr. Suthep, a former lawmaker and deputy prime minister with the opposition Democrat Party who resigned his seat to lead the current round of protests, describes them as a form of policy corruption. ""This is like buying votes. They are offering all this money, all of these promises, like capitalists making an investment in return for staying in power,"" Mr. Suthep said in recent interview at his base at a government administrative complex his supporters are occupying in the city's northern suburbs.

Ms. Yingluck, though, insists that neither she nor her family are interested in power for power's sake, and reckons the latest round of the crisis stems from continuing ripple effects from <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2006 coup</span> rather than last month's amnesty proposals.

""I think I can say that our family doesn't want to be part of any problem in Thailand,"" Ms. Yingluck said. ""The only thing we want to see is fairness for everyone, and a way to work together to find a long-term situation for Thailand.""

It will likely be difficult to get all the players in Thailand's political drama to read from the same script, however. Besides Mr. Suthep's black-clad, flag-waving protesters, there are Thailand's influential army and courts to consider.

Ms. Yingluck said she was confident the armed forces would continue to play a role in helping to mediate the conflict and refrain from intervening directly, as it is has done many times in Thailand's history; army commander-in-chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha has already helped organize one meeting between Ms. Yingluck and the silver-haired, 64-year-old Mr. Suthep.

Thailand's judiciary, though, might be less predictable. The courts <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008 removed</span> one pro-Thaksin prime minister from office for illegally hosting a television cooking show and ordered the dissolution of a pro-Thaksin government for alleged vote-buying.

This time, Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission is considering a petition from Ms. Yingluck's opponents to <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">investigate 312 pro</span>-government lawmakers for backing proposed changes to the constitution. Thailand's Constitutional Court ruled on Nov.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 that</span> the proposed amendments were illegal, opening the way for the anticorruption agency to suspend the politicians involved, and force the collapse of the government.

Ms. Yingluck said she was optimistic that wouldn't happen, though. ""I hope that they will be fair with everybody and stick with the rules, and stick with the principles"" of democracy, she said.

78491,"<h3>Pimco Appoints Man Group’s Manny Roman as Chief Executive</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Former Goldman Sachs banker to take helm in Pimco recovery effort

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 22,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:15 pm ET

Pacific Investment Management Co. surprised the investment world by replacing its chief executive after two years on the job, a sign of the pressure the California money manager faces as it grapples with sweeping changes to its industry.

</span>Pimco said Wednesday that Manny Roman, a 52-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who has led a turnaround of London hedge-fund firm Man Group PLC in recent years, will take over on Nov.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> The current chief executive, Douglas Hodge, will become managing director and senior adviser, the company said.

The change is the latest upheaval atop one of the world’s biggest asset managers, which gains its third chief executive in less than three years. Investors pulled billions following the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">abrupt 2014 departures</span> of former CEO Mohamed El-Erian and co-founder Bill Gross, once known as the bond king for his long record of returns.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The new CEO, Mr. Roman, arrives as the firm tries to stem outflows from Pimco’s flagship bond fund and establish a mix of businesses that can withstand growing investor preference for lower-cost products.</span> Assets in the firm’s flagship bond fund have more than halved from where they stood when Mr. Gross departed.

“Manny gives us an additional resource to react to the changing environment,” said Daniel Ivascyn, Pimco’s chief investment officer.

Pimco, a unit of German insurer Allianz SE, has contemplated a leadership change for some time because of concerns about larger industry shifts, said people familiar with the matter.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Late last year, a small group of senior executives led by Mr. Ivascyn began searching for a senior money-management executive to help shape its business moving forward, according to people familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">That became a quest for a leader who could guide the bond manager through an era of record-low interest rates and a customer shift to low-cost index funds, which together are eroding profit margins.

</span>By Memorial Day weekend, when Mr. Roman visited Laguna Beach, Calif., for a series of meetings with Pimco executives, the group had determined that they would seek to bring in Mr. Roman as a CEO. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Roman took over the reins at Man Group, then a struggling company, in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2013 and</span> executed a series of acquisitions that diversified the business.</span> The firm’s shares are <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 30% this</span> year amid a challenging year for the hedge-fund industry.

Mr. Hodge, a longtime Pimco executive thrust into the CEO role following Mr. El-Erian’s surprise <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014 departure</span>, was viewed internally and by clients as a steady hand who could manage the firm’s operations as Mr. Ivascyn moved to strengthen its investment teams and improve returns.

His low profile contrasted with Messrs. El-Erian and Gross. Senior Pimco executives concluded the firm would be better off enlisting an outside manager, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Hodge, who had advised the search group and was kept abreast of their thinking, agreed.

“I was completely on board with this,” Mr. Hodge said in an interview. “We’re in a very different place than we <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 12,</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22 months</span> ago. And so this was the moment for this.”

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“If there’s an incoming CEO who has experience outside the traditional asset classes, that’s probably a positive in today’s environment,” said Brett Cornwell, head of fixed-income research at Callan, an investment consultant.

Redemptions at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.51 trillion</span> money manager have slowed since Mr. Gross’s departure, but the firm’s flagship Total Return Fund has continued to suffer monthly outflows of hundreds of millions of dollars.

</span>Investors pulled a <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">net $800 million</span> from the fund in June, according to the firm, leaving assets <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $86.4 billion</span> at the end of the second quarter. The fund was <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.9% after</span> fees year to date through June, underperforming its benchmark, which was <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.31% during</span> the same period.

Across the entire firm Pimco earlier this year posted its first quarterly increase in assets under management in two years, due to inflows and improved performance.

The amount withdrawn by investors hasn’t topped the predictions of executives at the time Mr. Gross quit, according to two people close to the matter, and the redemptions weren’t the key reason Pimco made the CEO move.

Over the past year, as the firm steadied after Mr. Gross’s departure, executives hired outside consulting firms including McKinsey & Co. to examine the firm’s strategic direction.

One executive placement firm was retained by Pimco for six months to conduct a search for a new CEO, according to people familiar with the situation.

The firm cast a wide net of potential candidates, including executives at asset managers as well as banks, the people said.

At the start of the process, it was unclear the search would result in a new chief executive, though the likelihood of such a change became more clear in recent weeks as the firm’s discussions with Mr. Roman progressed, Mr. Ivascyn said.

Mr. Hodge was among a small group of executives that notified top Pimco executives about the new CEO at Pimco’s headquarters early Wednesday morning. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The group held a town hall-style meeting with employees later in the day.

</span>Mr. Hodge is expected to remain at the firm at least <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2017,</span> a person familiar with the situation said.

Some Pimco clients and their consultants said the CEO switch wouldn’t prompt any immediate moves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension, will internally assess its <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $1 billion</span> Pimco investment but “won’t make any knee-jerk reactions,” according to a fund spokesman.

Corrections & Amplifications: Only one executive placement firm was retained by Pacific Investment Management Co. for six months to conduct a search for a new CEO.</span> An earlier version of this story said at least two firms conducted a search for six months. (July 22)

96420,"<h3>Lebanon gets new government amid deepening crisis</h3>Lebanon gets new government amid deepening crisis
- Published
A new government has been announced in Lebanon over a year after the previous administration quit following the devastating Beirut port explosion.
Najib Mikati - Lebanon's richest man - becomes prime minister, a position he has held twice before.
His appointment, along with the naming of a new cabinet, ends months of political paralysis.
It comes as Lebanon grapples with some of the severest domestic crises it has faced in its history.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The value of the currency has collapsed, unemployment and inflation have soared, electricity, fuel and medicines are in short supply, and the country has been rocked by nearly two years of protests calling for wholesale political reforms.
</span>Lebanon had been without a proper functioning government since then-Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned days after a massive blast <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 4 August</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020 destroyed</span> Beirut port and the surrounding area.
The explosion, caused by improperly stored ammonium nitrate, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 203 people</span>, injured at <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 6,000 others</span> and left billions of dollars of damage.
The disaster - coming in the midst of the pandemic - triggered a wave of outrage against the government and Lebanon's political system. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Protesters blamed the blast on corruption, incompetence and a system of patronage where jobs are given in return for political support.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The event compounded growing anger which had been building since the start of the financial crisis in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2019.</span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In the last few months alone the Lebanese currency has <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 90% of</span> its value, while three quarters of the population are now living below the poverty line.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Speaking to the BBC after announcing the new cabinet, Mr Mikati said one of his first priorities would be to restart talks with the International Monetary Fund to secure a financial rescue package.
</span>""You know what a critical situation we are in,"" he said, noting the growing strain on the education and healthcare sectors, as well as the increasing numbers of people leaving the country.
He added that despite his own wealth, he was able to understand the impact of the current crisis on people's lives: ""I have three childrenâ¦ outside Lebanon. So I feel with people. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">I feel the kind of poverty, the kind of hunger they are in, the fear they have of the future.</span> So this is not just a matter of money or not [having] money.""
Lebanon's delicate sectarian power-sharing system had stymied repeated attempts to form a government in the wake of Hassan Diab's resignation.
Since the end of the 1975-89 civil war, political power has been delicately balanced between its many sects, with the president a Christian, prime minister a Sunni Muslim and Speaker a Shia Muslim. An inability to come to an agreement on the nomination of ministers to the satisfaction of various factions and blocs held up the process."
9712,"<h3>Brexit Highlights From a Momentous Day: Parliament Rejects New Election</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Here’s what you need to know:
- Johnson Loses Another Vote; He Has Yet to Win One as Prime Minister
- John Bercow plans to step down by the Brexit deadline.
- Lawmakers voted to force government to release private no-deal correspondence
- Extension question sets stage for a battle over elections.
- <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Parliament will be suspended after Monday’s business.
</span></span>Johnson Loses Another Vote; He Has Yet to Win One as Prime Minister
As the last hours of the parliamentary session ticked down on Monday night, Mr. Johnson had still yet to win a vote as prime minister.
His latest defeat came on a motion brought by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that reaffirmed the obligation of government ministers to uphold the rule of law. Mr. Johnson allowed the motion to pass without opposition.
Mr. Corbyn introduced the motion in light of reports in recent days that Mr. Johnson was planning to flout the law that blocks a no-deal Brexit by refusing to ask Brussels to delay the current deadline of Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.</span> Mr. Corbyn called that an “assault on the rule of law.”
Ministers later denied that the prime minister would break the law, but still suggested the government was looking for loopholes to avoid Mr. Johnson having to ask Brussels for an extension.
John Bercow plans to step down by the Brexit deadline.
John Bercow, the animated speaker of the House of Commons, said on Monday that he would step down by Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""142"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> the day Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union. He said he would not run should a general election be called before then.
“This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest honor and privilege of my life, for which I will be eternally grateful,” he said, becoming emotional as he thanked his wife and children for their support.
He also warned lawmakers to respect the process of the parliamentary system, noting, “We degrade this Parliament at our peril.”
The role of speaker has traditionally been an impartial, background figure, but Mr. Bercow brought new aggression to the role throughout the fraught Brexit debates that have dominated discussions in Parliament for years.
His actions — particularly his criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament, and his decision to bar a third vote on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement and effectively halt the government’s agenda — have made him some enemies in the Conservative Party.
Mr. Bercow’s plan to step down upends a Conservative Party plan to break with longtime convention and field a candidate to challenge him in the next general election. The party had said that Mr. Bercow broke the rules by allowing Parliament to take control of the Brexit process and hobble the government’s position.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Writing in the The Mail on Sunday, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, accused Mr. Bercow of “a flagrant abuse of this process” and of “giving power to the opposition.”
</span>“Bring back an impartial speaker,” she declared.
Last year, when Ms. Leadsom was leader of the House of Commons, Mr. Bercow was accused of calling her a “stupid woman” and “useless.” He admitted to muttering the words during a disagreement but denied insulting her personally.
Lawmakers voted to force government to release private no-deal correspondence
At the center of the controversy around Mr. Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament has been the question of why he really did it. Was it, as his office contended, an ordinary procedural move that had nothing to do with Brexit? Or was it expressly designed to keep lawmakers from intervening in the government’s hard-line Brexit plans?
To answer that question, lawmakers on Monday night voted by a narrow margin —<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 311 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 302 </span>— to force the government to publish private correspondence that would show its thinking.
The same vote will also force the government to publish a classified document known as Operation Yellowhammer, which outlines the government’s assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Many analysts fear that leaving without a formal agreement would lead to food and medicine shortages, among other calamities.
Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative lawmaker who was exiled by Mr. Johnson last week, said before the vote that public officials had told him the government’s handling of the suspension of Parliament “smacked of scandal.”
The government objected, with Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, questioning what legal right the government had to force workers to open up their private email accounts and messages.
Extension question sets stage for a battle over elections.
Legislation that would require Britain to seek another Brexit extension from the European Union if there is no withdrawal agreement by Oct.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19 became</span> law on Monday, a move that Prime Minister Boris Johnson bitterly opposed.
The opposition Labour Party and others have insisted that they will not consider Mr. Johnson’s request to hold a general election until after a no-deal Brexit was ruled out.
That sets the stage for another battle: whether, and when, to hold a general election. The vote on the snap general election is expected to take place <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 9 p</span>.m. and the early hours of Tuesday morning.
The success of the no-deal legislation is due in no small part to the decision last week <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 21 members</span> of Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party to defy him on the question of whether to leave without a deal. They were expelled from the party for their defiance.
The Tory revolt against Mr. Johnson, and his ruthless purging of the rebels, have reverberated through British politics, threatening his hold on power.
The prime minister and many of his allies say that Britain must preserve the possibility of leaving without a deal in order to maintain leverage in negotiations with Brussels. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Opponents of a no-deal withdrawal say it simply cannot be considered because of the potentially catastrophic consequences for the British economy.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Parliament will be suspended after Monday’s business.
</span>After just one week’s work following the summer vacation, British lawmakers will be sent away again Monday night when Parliament is “prorogued,” or suspended, until Oct.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span> the prime minister’s office said.
Lawmakers will first vote on whether to hold a snap election with the expectation that, as they did last week, they will refuse to give Prime Minister Boris Johnson the two-thirds majority he needs to call a vote next month.
Then Parliament will be suspended after formal announcements in both chambers and a ceremony that includes a cry in Norman French.
The suspension means that, if Mr. Johnson loses on Monday, he would not be able to attempt votes later this week to try to secure the snap election before the Oct.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 Brexit</span> deadline.
Boris Johnson Will Prorogue Parliament
Before Boris Johnson decided to suspended Parliament,
lawmakers had about five weeks in session to debate a Brexit deal.

The prime minister, who just had a humbling week in Parliament, will be spared any further appearances there for five weeks. But the absence of lawmakers at a moment of looming national crisis is likely to fuel criticism of Mr. Johnson’s hardball tactics and his determination to leave the European Union next month, without an agreement if necessary.
Lawmakers have passed a bill designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and the legislation received its final approval — a procedure known as royal assent — on Monday.
Mr. Johnson’s spokesman said that the prime minister would not break that law, but insisted that he would not request an extension to the Brexit deadline as the new legislation requires if he cannot reach a deal with the European Union or get Parliament’s approval for a no-deal exit.
How Mr. Johnson plans to achieve that was not explained.
Brussels is distracted by a looming Brexit deadline.
Ordinarily, this would be a week of unadulterated excitement in Brussels. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, who is set to become European Commission president on Nov.<span id=""139"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> is to present her college — or group — of commissioners who will lead different policy areas of the European Union bureaucracy for the next five years.
But Brexit is threatening to put a dampener on this twice-a-decade exercise, as questions of a possible extension to Britain’s withdrawal deadline raise concerns about how the country can remain a member of the bloc without having a commissioner.
The commission, which typically has one representative from each European Union country, has so far refused to be drawn into speculation about a potential delay. Mina Andreeva, the commission spokeswoman, said on Monday that the bloc was working under the assumption that Britain would leave by the Oct.<span id=""140"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""143"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 deadline</span></span>.
Other European Union members signaled that they were running out of patience. France, leading a group of nations skeptical of another extension, reiterated its position that any extension would have to come with a detailed plan of what Britain intends to do with the extra time.
“We are not going to do this every three months,” Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister said, speaking with the <span id=""141"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 1 radio</span> program on Sunday.
The British Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is to return to Brussels on Wednesday to continue “technical discussions” with his European counterparts. These twice-weekly meetings in Brussels were heralded as a breakthrough by the British government, but they have so far yielded nothing in terms of an alternative to the Irish border backstop — a major sticking point in current talks.
Boris Johnson is likely to revive his election push.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to try again on Monday to call a general election, a move that is expected to suffer the same fate as a first effort that fell short last week.
Mr. Johnson’s working majority has quickly evaporated, and new elections would give him a chance to re-establish a stable power base. But mistrust among his opponents is so high that they would not support a new vote until the legislation blocking a no-deal exit was locked in.
That has created an unusual situation in which his opponents, who would normally jump at a chance to vote him out of office, are fighting an attempt to hold a new election, which can happen only after a two-thirds majority in Parliament supports it.
“It’s the most sensational paradox,” Mr. Johnson, who came to power less than two months ago, said on Friday. “Never in history has the opposition party been given the chance for election and has turned it down.”
Many lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party want to wait at least until November to hold an election. They fear that a strong victory in October would allow Mr. Johnson to reverse any no-deal legislation.
Will the prime minister defy the law?
The battle over an extension has raised the specter of whether Mr. Johnson would risk jail to get his way.
Mr. Johnson has made clear that he wants to complete Brexit by the end of October, declaring that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask the European Union for another delay. But legal experts have warned that he could face jail time if he refused to abide by the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which was approved on Friday and is set to become law on Monday.
On Saturday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said, “We’re in quite extraordinary territory when the prime minister says he is above the law.”
A former top prosecutor, Lord MacDonald, told Sky News that if Mr. Johnson refused to request an extension, “that would amount to contempt of court, which could find that person in prison.”
The government appears willing to “test to the limit” the new law, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab telling reporters that the government would abide by the law, but that it would also “look very carefully” at its “interpretation” of the “bad” legislation.
Boris Johnson meets with the Irish leader in Dublin.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson began the week in a different European capital, Dublin. But the message was the same as it was last week in London: His vow to leave the European Union without a deal was a non-starter.
“There’s no such thing as a clean break — or just getting it done,” the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said to Mr. Johnson, throwing his own words back at him.
On a chilly, gray day, with the Irish and British flags flapping behind them, Mr. Varadkar and Mr. Johnson both spoke of the need to find solutions. But the gulf between them seemed wide.
The Irish border remains the biggest barrier to a Brexit deal. All sides want to avoid the imposition of significant checks between Ireland, a member of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. A hard border could renew sectarian tensions that raged for decades.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Johnson has rejected the so-called backstop agreement reached by his predecessor, Theresa May, which would all but keep Northern Ireland inside the single European market for a few years, so that Ireland would not have to inspect goods flowing in from the north.
</span>Mr. Johnson quashed any expectations that he had brought new proposals. He simply restated the case that he made last week to British lawmakers.
“We must get Brexit done because the U.K. must come out on Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""142"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span></span> or else I fear permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the U.K,” Mr. Johnson said in Dublin on Monday. “I know that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for.”
While both men emphasized the need for a deal, neither seemed to have high expectations for the visit. Mr. Varadkar noted it would be a “herculean task” for Mr. Johnson to negotiate a new deal before the Oct.<span id=""140"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""143"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 deadline</span></span>.
Brexit rebels sling insults at Boris Johnson and his supporters.
There are fights, and then there are family fights, just as there are insults, and family insults.
From the moment last week when Prime Minister Boris Johnson <span id=""144"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expelled 21 Conservative</span> rebel lawmakers who defied him in a critical vote, the Tories have been in full family fight mode, and the insults have been colorful, to say the least.
A barrage of insults came from Nicholas Soames, one of the lawmakers who was expelled from the party. Mr. Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, took pointed issue with Mr. Johnson — “Boris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill” — but especially with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the House of Commons leader who was widely lampooned after he reclined on the front bench of Parliament during the Brexit debate last week.
“He is in serious danger of believing his own shtick,” Mr. Soames told the Times of London on Saturday. “He is an absolute fraud, he is a living example of what a moderately cut double-breasted suit and a decent tie can do with an ultraposh voice.”
Mr. Soames then offered some earthier anatomical imagery before describing Mr. Rees-Mogg’s speech during the Brexit debate as “the lowest form of student union hackery, insolence and bad manners.”
And to think they were once on the same team.

16049,"<h3>Socialism: A Venezuelan Family Needs 28 Minimum Wages to Buy Food for a Month</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">A family in Venezuela required on average the equivalent <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 28.32 months</span>’ worth of the country’s minimum wage to be able to properly afford food during September, according to data published by the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis of the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (CENDAS-FVM) on Sunday.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The data is derived from the cost of the “market basket,” a list <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 60 basic</span> items that would, in normal circumstances, cover the basic food and nutritional needs of a family living in Venezuela (roughly equivalent to the American Consumer Price Index).</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The basket is used by CENDAS-FVM and other organizations – in lieu of proper and transparent official data from the country’s ruling socialist regime – to gauge the effects inflation has on Venezuelans’ purchasing power
</span>According to the organization’s research, a Venezuelan citizen required on <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 3,681.87 Venezuelan</span> Bolivars ($446.83 at the time the data was published) to be able to afford the “food basket” during September, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15.9 percent</span> increase from the previous month. The amount excludes other possible family expenses, such as for health, education, or clothing.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Venezuela’s current monthly minimum wage, which socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro last raised <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1,757 percent</span> in March, is currently set <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 130 bolivars</span>.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">While 130 bolivars</span> were worth <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $30 at</span> the time of Maduro’s March minimum wage raise, the amount is now only worth <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately $15 as</span> of October 24’s official exchange rate, due to the constant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The current iteration of the Venezuelan currency, the “digital bolivar,” was launched on <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 1,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span></span> Thanks to Venezuela’s ongoing crisis – caused by two decades of socialist policies – it has already lost half of its value within its first year of circulation. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The United States dollar, once demonized, and which the socialist regime at one point made illegal for citizens to have or trade with, is now freely used by everyone to set the prices of goods and services in the country.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">As a result, a Venezuelan citizen needs to earn at <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 122.72 bolivars</span> (<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $14.89</span>) per day to be able to cover basic food expenses for their family; an entire month’s minimum wage only <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covers 94 percent</span> of one day’s food for their family.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">While wages in the public sector can be higher than the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">base 130 bolivars</span> based on a person’s education level and rank, even the topmost officials fall overwhelmingly short of being able to cover all of a family’s food expenses.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Private sector wages, which were estimated to have averaged US$126.50 per month by <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2022,</span> also are insufficient to properly feed a family.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">As a result of insufficient wages, many have shifted from working in either public or private sector companies to self-employment, while others are heavily dependent on remittances from abroad to be able to palliate the unending effects of inflation.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The recent data published by CENDAS-FVM complements that published by the Venezuelan Observatory of Finances on <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 6,</span> which measured Venezuela’s inflation rate for the month of September <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11.5 percent</span> – for a total <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 111.8 percent</span> accumulated inflation <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022 so</span> far.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Its version of the “food basket” was calculated at a more reserved US$375 for September; Venezuela’s monthly minimum wage only covers four percent of it.

As Affordable Housing Crisis Grows, HUD Sits on the Sidelines
WASHINGTON —</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The country is in the grips of an escalating housing affordability crisis.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Millions of low-income Americans are <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 70 percent</span> or more of their incomes for shelter, while rents continue to rise and construction of affordable rental apartments lags far behind the need.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Trump administration’s main policy response, unveiled this spring by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development: a plan to triple rents for <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 712,000 of</span> the poorest tenants receiving federal housing aid and to loosen the cap on rents <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 4.5 million</span> households enrolled in federal voucher and public housing programs nationwide, with the goal of moving longtime tenants out of the system to make way for new ones.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">As city and state officials and members of both parties clamor for the federal government to help, Mr. Carson has privately told aides that he views the shortage of affordable housing as regrettable, but as essentially a local problem.
</span>A former presidential candidate who said last year that he did not want to give recipients of federal aid “a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say, ‘I’ll just stay here; they will take care of me,’” he has made it a priority to reduce, rather than expand, assistance to the poor, to break what he sees as a cycle of dependency.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">And when congressional Democrats and Republicans scrambled to save his department’s budget and rescue an endangered tax credit that accounts for nine out <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 affordable</span> housing developments built in the country, Mr. Carson sat on the sidelines, according to legislators and congressional staff members.
</span>Local officials seem resigned to the fact that they will receive little or no help from the Trump administration.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“To be brutally honest, I think that we aren’t really getting any help right now out of Washington, and the situation has gotten really bad over the last two years,” said Chad Williams, executive director of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, which oversees public housing developments and voucher programs that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">serve 16,000 people</span> in the Las Vegas area.
Nevada, ground zero in the housing crisis a decade ago, is now the epicenter of the affordability crunch, with low-income residents squeezed out of once-affordable apartments by working-class refugees fleeing from California’s own rental crisis.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I think Carson’s ideas, that public housing shouldn’t be multigenerational, are noble,” Mr. Williams said.</span> “But right now these programs are a stable, Band-Aid fix, and we really need them.”
Underlying the conflict between Mr. Carson and officials like Mr. Williams are fundamental disagreements over the role the federal government should play.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Carson believes federal aid should be regarded only as a temporary crutch for families moving from dependency to work and sees the rent increases as a way to expand his agency’s budget.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Low-income renters and many local officials who run housing programs see the federal assistance as a semi-permanent hedge against evictions and homelessness that needs to be expanded in times of crisis.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">This year, the White House proposed to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slash $8.8 billion</span> from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s most important housing programs.</span> While aides say Mr. Carson privately pushed for a restoration in programs for seniors and disabled people, he publicly supported the gutting of his own department, reiterating to lawmakers last month that he felt as much responsibility toward taxpayers as tenants.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“I continue to advocate for fiscal responsibility as well as compassion,” Mr. Carson told a House committee in June.</span> He declined to comment for this article.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Carson’s most significant policy proposal as secretary, so-called maximum rents paid by the poorest households in public housing would rise <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $150 a</span> month <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $50.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">His proposal has received little support from local housing operators.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Over the past month, Mr. Carson has huddled with Representative Dennis A. Ross, Republican of Florida, who is drafting less stringent legislation that would allow, but not mandate, local housing authorities to raise rents and carry out reforms to streamline the process of verifying the poverty of applicants, aides said.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Still, both proposals represent a paradigm shift in federal housing policy, ending the requirement that low-income tenants spend no more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 percent</span> of their net income on rent.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Tying rents to incomes has been a central part of the system <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981,</span> especially for the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 housing</span> voucher program, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">enabling 2.1 million</span> low-income families to rent private apartments they could not otherwise afford.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Mr. Carson’s proposal would peg rents <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 35 percent</span> of gross income for all tenants.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Ross bill excludes voucher recipients, at the request of local housing authority officials.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“We need sensible reforms to make the system more efficient for agencies and residents,” said Adrianne Todman, chief executive of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.</span> “But now is not the time for arbitrary federal rent hikes.”
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">“This isn’t about dependence,” said Diane Yentel, president of the nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group that has released several recent reports documenting the affordability crunch.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Today’s housing crisis is squarely rooted in the widening gap between incomes and housing costs.”
</span>And the crisis didn’t begin under Mr. Trump’s presidency.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Median national rents rose <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 32 percent</span> in constant dollars <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2001 to</span></span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> while wages remained flat, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The pace has picked up over the last few years, buoyed by an improving economy.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The rent increases are hitting poor and elderly people, African-Americans and low-income wage earners the hardest.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">A survey by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a worker earning the state minimum wage could afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 22 of</span> the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 3,000 counties</span>.
</span>The Obama administration initially proposed steep increases for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 and</span></span> other programs, but pulled back after the Republicans won control of the House <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span>
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">During <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 campaign</span>, Mr. Obama promised to fund an affordable housing trust fund for the construction of new units.</span> But the $200-million-a-year program, funded by the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was blocked by Republican lawmakers <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2014.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> it was on track to finance the construction of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,000 units</span> of affordable housing <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 32 states</span>, according to federal data.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Its sister program, the Capital Magnet Fund, which has leveraged private investment to <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">create 17,000 new</span> units, is in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who tried to cut it <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $141.7 million</span> this year as part of his unsuccessful budget recession effort this summer.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Under Mr. Trump, funding for public housing, vouchers and new construction has risen slightly — against the president’s wishes.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">In March, Republican and Democratic negotiators rejected Mr. Trump’s budget, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adding $1.25 billion</span> to HUD’s rental assistance programs and injecting an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $425 million</span> to the HOME program, which funds state, local, nonprofit and private partnerships to build affordable housing.
</span>Those moves, while significant, are likely to have a limited impact on the larger problem of the increasing number of families who cannot afford a place to live.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">While prices are cooling at the high end of the market in many big cities, the low- and middle-income housing markets in Nevada, Texas, California, Florida and Colorado are so hot, local officials say, that landlords routinely reject subsidized tenants because they can charge more to other renters.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Rental construction has focused on attracting high-income tenants.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2001 to</span></span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013,</span> the number of rental apartments for high-wage earners increased <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 36 percent</span>, while units for poor people shrank by <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 10 percent</span>, according to federal housing statistics.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">With affordable stock scarce, prices are spiking.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">An <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 12 million</span> Americans, most of them poor, now spend more than half of their earnings on housing, according to HUD statistics.
</span>One of them is Judith Toro Fortyz,<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 75,</span> who <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">receives $848 a</span> month in Social Security and <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pays $594.88 of</span> it to remain in the small two-bedroom apartment on Staten Island that she once shared with her mother.
Mrs. Toro Fortyz has been turned down for federal vouchers, reflecting a shortage in assistance that has shut out three of every four eligible applicants for <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Even with an additional housing stipend from the city, she is <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending 70 percent</span> of her income on rent.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">That has forced her to make wrenching decisions, like forgoing her favorite fruit, oranges, after a price spike at her local supermarket.
</span>“I stay home a lot. I’d rather not go out because going out means you have to spend money,” said Mrs. Toro Fortyz, a retired data storage worker. “I have a friend who gets <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 and</span></span>, oh my God, they <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $200 a</span> month. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">I can’t even imagine having that much money to live on.”
Mr. Carson’s proposal alarmed many low-income tenants, especially older ones, who could face significant rent increases under the plan.</span> “We basically wouldn’t be able to get by,” said Patrick Greene,<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 69,</span> a retired truck driver who lives in a small HUD-subsidized apartment with his wife in Montgomery, Ala.
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">A more immediate threat to affordable housing, critics say, is the huge tax bill passed by Congress last year, which imperils one of the most important sources of long-term funding, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.
Novogradac & Company, a firm that provides analytics for the construction and finance industries, estimated that demand for the $9-billion-a-year credit could dry up as investors realize savings through the tax cuts.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">The firm estimates that <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 235,000 fewer</span> apartments could be built over the next decade as a result of the tax code rewrite.
</span>A bipartisan coalition, led by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, was able to expand the credit by an <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $400 million</span>. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">But that is not likely to offset the damage done by the tax measure.
</span>The administration is observing these efforts from the sidelines. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump, scion of a New York real estate family that made its fortune in the 1950s and 1960s building affordable housing for white working-class neighborhoods, has shown little interest in tackling the problem.
</span>He made only passing mention of the issue during <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span> and has pressed Mr. Carson to move more aggressively to impose work requirements on federal aid recipients.
For his part, Mr. Carson publicly acknowledges the crisis in most of his speeches. “Alarmingly high numbers of Americans continue to pay more than half of their incomes toward rent,” he told a House panel in October. <span id=""43"" class=""red"">“Many millions remain mired in poverty, rather than being guided on a path out of it.”
</span>But he is focused less on federal solutions than on prodding local governments to ease barriers to construction. <span id=""44"" class=""red"">He has ordered his policy staff to come up with proposals to push local governments to reduce zoning restrictions on new projects, especially low-cost manufactured housing.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">HUD will also begin working with landlords around the country to come up with ways to make housing vouchers more attractive and more inclusive, aides said.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">“Subsidies are a piece of the puzzle,” said Raffi Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Carson, “but we must also address the regulatory barriers relative to zoning and land use in higher-cost markets that are preventing the construction of new affordable housing.</span> This is not just a federal problem — it’s everybody’s problem.”

Brazil’s constitution must be amended to allow its pension system to be restructured, and making that happen is seen as a make-or-break test of whether the government can get its arms around mounting economic problems like rising debt, low investment and a stubborn recession now entering its third year.

</span>New pension rules are considered central to fixing an insolvent system in a country where some retirees receive pensions before <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 50 and</span> surviving spouses can receive full pensions of the deceased while still drawing their own.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Passing the reform would bring confidence in Brazil’s solvency, improve risk perception, lower borrowing costs, attract capital and even help tame inflation by beefing up the currency—a whole positive cycle,” said Patricia Krause, Latin America economist at French credit-insurance firm Coface in São Paulo.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“If it doesn’t pass, there will be less confidence, less capital, higher interest.”

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The budget gap will keep growing,” she added, “and you can’t afford that.”

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Those who oppose the pension overhaul argue the government should keep financing the deficit by cutting tax benefits to corporations and raising taxes for the rich instead of targeting working people.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">“This reform is unfair,” said Jânio Bosco Gandra, who leads <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 171,000</span>-member labor group for police officers.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Temer has already been forced to make a series of major compromises, including exempting state and local government employees from the overhaul.</span> But the future of his initiative became even more uncertain Thursday, after the Supreme Court made allegations public that Mr. Temer took part in <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2010 meeting</span> where the payment of a $40-million bribe from construction giant Odebrecht SA to his party was discussed, according to the testimony of a former Odebrecht executive present at the meeting. Mr. Temer energetically denied the allegations.

They came days after the Supreme Court ordered investigations of eight of Mr. Temer’s ministers, including some of those working on the pension overhaul, along with more <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 members</span> of congress.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Markets were initially upbeat about the bill’s chances, pushing up Brazil’s stock market and currency over the past six months.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But the economic outlook has dimmed lately as Mr. Temer’s political plight has worsened, making it harder for him to wrangle the necessary support for the bill.

</span>The timetable for a vote on the amendment has been pushed back repeatedly, and legislators have sought to further water down Mr. Temer’s proposals, by for instance maintaining the lower retirement ages for women and dragging out the transition from the old social-security regime to the new one.

Lawmakers face general elections next year and are wary of angering voters. A running tally of pension-reform vote intentions in the lower house by Estado de S. Paulo newspaper showed on Thursday that <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 101 of</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 513 legislators</span> said they would approve the reform, <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 275 would</span> vote against it. The president <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needs 308 votes</span> in the lower house to amend the constitution.

“I think it will be hard to pass pension reform without changes that would defeat its purpose,” said Rep. Alfredo Kaefer of the right-wing Social Liberal Party, which supports the administration.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The generosity of Brazil’s pension system is legendary—and, economists say, troubling as the country’s fertility rate plummets and life expectancy climbs.

</span>João Mansur, a long-time state legislator in Paraná state, served as interim governor there <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 39 days</span> <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> a stint that qualified him to retire with <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $8,000 monthly</span> pension. He died <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 at</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 88,</span> but his widow, 89-year-old Madalena Mansur, continues to get the checks. She declined to comment.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Temer, who <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 76,</span> retired from his job as a state prosecutor more than two decades ago and <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collects $8,596 a</span> month, though he deducts those payments from his presidential salary.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Other former public workers who retire not only reap nearly the same income they got while on the job, but also see their checks get bumped up whenever those still working in the same job category get raises.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Economists say Brazil doesn’t have the luxury of waiting to change the system much longer.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Retirement outlays will eat <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 43% of</span> the $422-billion national budget this year.

</span>Demographics are playing against a generous system created in great part to bridge Brazil’s infamous social gap. Official statistics say there <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 11 retirees</span> for <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 100 working</span>-age Brazilians; that will rise <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 44 per</span><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 by</span><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2060.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The treasury will <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $58.1 billion</span> this year to cover a social-security deficit that was <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $900 million</span> <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span>

</span>Even current retirees are worried.

“The system will go belly up,” said Mario Luiz Pegoraro,<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 73,</span> a former executive at state power group Eletronorte who retired <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 54.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">He is afraid the government will soon run out of funds to pay <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $1,059 monthly</span> pension and says he wishes he had stayed longer in the job.

</span>“We need to think about the future generations,” he said, echoing the government’s argument that today’s workers risk getting no pensions at all if people keep retiring so young. “Working doesn’t kill you.”

U.S. coronavirus cases <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpass 14,000</span>; China reports no new domestic virus infections
California ordered it<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 40 Million</span></span> residents to stay at home except for essential activities beginning Thursday night in the largest such lockdown in the U.S., as the nation’s total coronavirus cases rose to more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 14,000 and</span> an intensifying outbreak in Europe pushed State Department officials to advise citizens not to travel abroad.
In a letter to President Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 56% of</span> the state’s population, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 25.5 million</span> people, would be infected over an eight-week period.
Mr. Newsom sent the letter—asking that a naval hospital ship be deployed to Los Angeles to increase health-care capacity—before the lockdown order. In calling for people to stay home, Mr. Newsom asked the state’s residents to “bend the curve together.” Nearly half of residents in America’s most populous state had already been given stay-at-home orders from local cities and counties, including Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.
As the center of the virus continues to shift to the West, the death toll in Italy surpassed that of China, where the outbreak originated in December. Fatalities in Italy <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 3,405 Thursday</span>, compared <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3,251 in</span> mainland China, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. China reported no new domestic coronavirus infections for the first time since the outbreak surfaced.
In the U.S., confirmed cases jumped <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 14,250.</span> Officials warned the number would continue to rise as testing capabilities increase and advised Americans to prepare for a prolonged period of uncertainty. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 200 Americans</span> have died as a result of the illness.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Latest on the Coronavirus

</span>- China <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">records 34 imported</span> cases of the virus
- Nations put in place additional travel restrictions to limit the virus’s spread
- American hospitals face a shortage of masks, gowns and other equipment
More than half of the U.S. cases come from three states: New York, Washington and California, according to Johns Hopkins data.</span> The number of infections in New York nearly doubled <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4,152 Thursday</span> as the state <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">conducted 8,000 tests</span> overnight, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In Washington, Senate Republicans unveiled a stimulus package that includes direct cash payments to Americans and help for businesses and health-care professionals.</span> The proposal, days after a Trump administration plan valued <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1 trillion</span>, would need support from congressional Democrats.
President Trump said he is directing the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate red tape to more quickly develop therapies to help patients diagnosed with the coronavirus.
As part of an escalating U.S. response to contain the virus’s spread, the State Department raised its travel advisory, warning Americans against all international travel, and urged those abroad to return over fears the pandemic could put a halt to international commercial travel. The U.S. is also closing its border with Canada, and has discussed plans for a similar measure at the southern border.
The White House said Thursday that the Group of Seven Leaders Summit that the U.S. was set to host at Camp David in June will now be done by video-teleconference, because of the pandemic. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Spokesman Judd Deere said that the decision was made at Mr. Trump’s direction and that National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has notified his counterparts in the other countries.</span> Mr. Trump also plans to convene meetings with the leaders of G-7 countries by video teleconference in April and May.
There were more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 244,000 confirmed</span> coronavirus cases world-wide Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins. More <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10,000 people</span> have died, while more <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 86,000 have</span> since recovered, most of whom reside in China. The rapid increase in reported cases reflects how people in many countries were unwittingly transmitting the virus before governments grasped the scale of the problem.
State and local governments taking on the task of testing for the coronavirus have been quickly overwhelmed. Slowed by equipment shortages and struggling to keep pace, some states and counties are pulling back, using their limited resources to test only the most vulnerable. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Leaders are scrambling to cover coronavirus-related costs, pulling from their reserves and preparing for steep tax revenue declines as restaurants close and tourism wanes.
</span>Health officials and researchers in the U.S. say they expect to see more coronavirus cases in elder-care facilities, despite aggressive steps by the industry and federal nursing-home regulators to limit visitors and isolate residents to avoid transmission. Cases have emerged in facilities from Illinois to Oregon and Wyoming, following a deadly outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home.
Meanwhile, manufacturers were rushing this week to produce medical ventilators used to help critically ill coronavirus patients.
“Every state is shopping for ventilators,” said Mr. Cuomo, whose state has the most infections of any in the U.S. “We’re shopping for ventilators.” The governor said the state is focused on increasing hospital capacity and finding new hospital beds.
Governors across the country expressed concerns over their health-care systems, industries and first responders in a call with the president and vice president Thursday. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he worried the virus would exceed the capacity of his state’s health system in as soon as seven days, and asked Mr. Trump for help dealing with a possible surge. Mr. Trump said he would strongly consider block grants to help state coronavirus response efforts.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses—which excludes grocery stores, farms, health-care facilities, and some manufacturers—to close by Thursday evening. He said the order will be enforced with citations, fines and license suspensions beginning Saturday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Congress is considering further legislation to assist some hard-hit industries, as the economic fallout of the virus continued to reverberate across America.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits increased sharply last week, the front end of a surge in claims tied to the pandemic.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Employers have laid off workers, cut hours or suspended work as preventive measures have forced businesses to ratchet down operations and stop patrons from entering.
</span>U.S. stocks rose Thursday after central banks deployed emergency measures to try to mitigate damage from the pandemic. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">U.S. oil prices rebounded from their lowest level <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 18 years</span>, notching their largest-ever one-day percentage climb.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Across Europe, governments and officials took fresh steps to stem the virus and its economic impact.</span> Organizers for the Cannes Film Festival in France postponed the mid-May event until the summer. London city officials closed portions of the capital’s subway system amid a steep rise in infections. Some British officials worry that the pandemic will soon overwhelm London’s health-care system. More than one-third of the U.K.’<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2,716 confirmed</span> coronavirus cases are in the capital.
Several European countries said their hospital systems were near capacity. Overwhelmed hospitals in northern Italian towns such as Bergamo are having to choose which patients get the last beds in intensive care.
The death toll in Iran, the world’s third-hardest-hit country, rose <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1,284,</span> said the government, which has come under fire for responding slowly and insufficiently to the outbreak.
The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State halted training of Iraqi forces due to the threat of the virus, a coalition official said Thursday. The British government said it was pulling some of its forces out of the country.
More countries, especially in Asia, are seeing new infection cases predominantly coming from those with recent travel history outside their home borders, prompting fears of a second wave of infections. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">China <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">recorded 34 imported</span> cases of the virus, officials said Thursday.</span> Of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 47 new</span> cases announced in Singapore on Wednesday,<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 33 people</span> had traveled outside the island nation.

Brazil closed its borders with eight neighboring countries on Thursday, joining other South American nations in an effort to control the spread of the virus.

WASHINGTON—<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first six months on the job were smooth sailing.</span> The past six have been the opposite.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">He has learned that the economic outlook can change suddenly, that communicating with jittery markets is harder than it looks and that President Trump isn’t likely to make his job any easier.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Looking ahead, Mr. Powell will have to apply what he’s learning to a question that could define his term—whether to cut interest rates at coming meetings to keep the economy growing.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Fed chairman is navigating three discrete challenges: setting a policy to extend what is already a 10-year-old expansion, explaining clearly why the Fed does what it does, and ignoring the loudest public Fed badgering from a president in recent memory.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The Fed is always a lightning rod,” said Julia Coronado, founder of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.</span> “Right now, there’s a lot more lightning.”

Mr. Trump called in to a CNBC news program on Monday morning and complained about policy under Mr. Powell, who goes by Jay. “They made a big mistake. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">They raised interest rates far too fast,” Mr. Trump said.</span> “It’s more than just Jay Powell. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">We have people on the Fed that really weren’t—you know, they’re not my people.”

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s hectoring of the Fed—over and over through the past year, in tweets, interviews and extemporaneous remarks—has persuaded some investors that the Fed’s decision to shelve plans to raise rates this year came in response to the White House.</span> Investors also haven’t understood what Mr. Powell is saying at times, fueling more confusion.

Mr. Powell’s game plan is to tune out the president. The more he does, the more demanding Mr. Trump gets. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">After the Fed signaled early this year its pivot away from raising rates, Mr. Trump started calling for rate cuts.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Such a stance could boost the economy and help the president as he runs for re-election.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The recent escalation of trade tensions has also fueled worries about a sharper growth slowdown that could force the Fed to act by cutting rates.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">A weak jobs report on Friday added to the concerns.

</span>Shortly after Mr. Powell unveiled the policy shift in January, administration officials arranged an awkward dinner between him and the president at the White House residence. It happened to fall on Mr. Powell’s 66th birthday.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">A few weeks later, Mr. Trump surprised his advisers and Mr. Powell by calling the Fed leader on his cellphone to discuss a disappointing jobs report.</span> “I guess I’m stuck with you,” the president told Mr. Powell, according to the president’s later recounting of the call to supporters.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s advisers are generally uneasy about public attacks on the Fed, according to people who have spoken with them.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">A few believe the Fed is already thinking of lowering rates no matter what the president wants.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow has rejected the idea that Mr. Trump’s comments harm the Fed’s credibility.</span> “We have our views. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">You can have your views without breaking the independence of the Fed,” he told reporters in April.</span> Asked about Mr. Powell’s reaction to Mr. Trump’s criticism, Mr. Kudlow said, “I think he handled it pretty well.”

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">A look at how the Fed made decisions over the past six months—based on interviews with current and former Fed officials, White House advisers and market participants—shows the challenge facing Mr. Powell and the Fed now, at a time when so much about the economy is riding on how trade disputes with China and other countries work out.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">When Mr. Powell became Fed chairman in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> the central bank’s models suggested inflation was likely to quicken given declining unemployment, tax cuts and a federal spending increase.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell isn’t trained as an economist and has a more plain-spoken approach than his predecessors.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He initially thought this would be a strength, and it has been useful in speaking with lawmakers and the wider public or when the economy produced fewer surprises.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">His first year in office showed this breezy style can also be a liability, because an unforgiving audience—asset investors—parses a Fed boss’s every word.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">During an on-stage interview in October, Mr. Powell spooked some listeners with an off-hand comment describing interest rates as a “long way” from a neutral setting that neither spurs nor slows growth.</span> Investors took the remark to mean he thought rates needed to rise more than they were expecting.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell had an even rougher time in December, when the Fed pushed through its fourth increase of the year in short-term interest rates to get them closer to normal and control future inflation pressures.

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials, in September, had penciled in one more increase by the year’s end.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Through the fall, however, they knew the case for higher rates was weakening, owing to a slowdown in Europe and escalating trade tensions with China.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">They began strategizing how they might slow their pace of quarterly rate increases—yet weren’t convinced they should stop, either, since the U.S. economy still looked healthy.

</span>Mr. Powell thought they could strike the right balance by pairing a December increase with a milder projected path of future increases. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials believe it’s the cumulative thrust of policy, not any one rate decision, that ultimately matters for the economy.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Fed’s rate-setting meetings are mapped out weeks ahead of time.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell speaks with the other four Fed board members and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 12 Fed</span> bank presidents in advance.</span> The board’s staff circulates a proposed version of their policy statement together with two alternatives, outlining either a tighter or an easier stance.

The choreography typically helps smooth consensus-building among what can be an unwieldy crowd of policy makers. <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Some officials said it hurt the Fed in this instance because it made them less agile.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Financial markets tumbled in the days leading up to the December rate decision, and Mr. Trump repeatedly called on the Fed to stand pat hours before the meeting.

</span>Priming markets to expect a rate increase “really put us in a box in this kind of situation. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">If you try to make changes on the fly, that’s always very difficult,” said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.

</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">Mr. Bullard and the presidents of Fed banks in Philadelphia and Minneapolis didn’t favor raising rates in December.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Others, such as Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, were comfortable going ahead with a December increase but wanted to more directly signal a pause immediately thereafter.

</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">Inside the Fed’s paneled conference room, Mr. Bullard reminded colleagues that in past periods of such volatility, including under longtime Fed leader Alan Greenspan, they would have delayed such an increase until the next meeting, scheduled for the end of January.

</span>“That is a typical Greenspanian move,” he said. “I don’t think this committee is used to behaving that way.”

At Mr. Powell’s post-meeting press conference, his attempt to calm queasy markets failed. When he underscored that rates would rise less than anticipated previously, markets heard him say they would keep climbing.

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Investors were also spooked after he said the Fed’s plan to shrink its balance sheet was “on autopilot.”</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">The comment didn’t reveal new information but added to fears the Fed was on a predetermined path to tighten credit policy.</span> Mr. Powell knew they hadn’t struck the right tone as soon as the press conference ended.

<span id=""38"" class=""red"">Over the following two weeks, credit and stock markets worsened.</span> Mr. Trump fumed to his advisers about potentially replacing Mr. Powell, though administration officials later said the White House lacked the power to do so.

<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Presidents nominate Fed chairmen to a four-year term, subject to Senate confirmation.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">The law says Fed governors, who include the chairman, can be dismissed only “for cause,” which courts have interpreted to mean malfeasance or abuse of office.

</span><span id=""41"" class=""red"">When Mr. Powell returned from a family vacation in Florida after the holidays, he huddled with Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and by phone with New York Fed President John Williams to discuss where policy needed to land by the time of their Jan. 29-30 meeting, and how to get there.

</span>Mr. Powell used a previously scheduled on-stage interview on Friday, Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> alongside his two predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, to unfurl the pivot to suspending further rate increases.

To avoid any miscues, Mr. Powell, who is at ease speaking off-the-cuff, responded to the opening question by reading from a piece of paper. Markets rallied.

Mr. Powell unveiled the shift without consulting with all of the reserve bank presidents. They supported him.

<span id=""42"" class=""red"">“Everybody realized pretty quickly that the communications needed adjusting” after the December financial-market swoon, said Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.</span> “I give him high props for making that leadership choice to pivot.”

<span id=""43"" class=""red"">By March, most Fed officials were projecting no interest-rate increases <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019.</span>

</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">And officials said that in six months, they would end the credit-tightening practice of allowing Fed-owned bonds to expire unreplaced.

</span>Both of these were moves Mr. Trump had wanted a few months earlier.

The shift soothed markets, but not Mr. Trump. <span id=""45"" class=""red"">He said the Fed should cut short-term rates, and announced plans to name outspoken loyalists—and central bank critics—to the Fed’s board.

</span>Mr. Trump called Mr. Powell on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 11 to</span> talk about the need for lower rates. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">He reached the Fed leader <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 9 p</span>.m., just after Mr. Powell delivered remarks at the House Democrats’ annual retreat that defended the central bank’s independence.

</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Investors in futures markets began to place higher odds on a rate cut in the lead-up to the Fed’s most recent meeting, April 30-<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 1.</span>

Mr. Powell, in his press conference after the May meeting, pushed back against those expectations, when he described a recent inflation slowdown as temporary.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">That confounded some investors because Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, have also signaled more alarm over why inflation isn’t rising more.

</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">“There is a good deal of confusion about what the Fed is doing and why they’re doing it, and the Fed is responsible for some of that,” said Robert Brusca, who runs an economic consulting firm in New York.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Since Fed officials last met, the economic outlook has turned bleaker with the worsening of trade tensions with China.</span> Bond markets turned more anxious after Mr. Trump’s unexpected decision to threaten tariffs on Mexico to secure tighter migration curbs.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">Rising worry about a pullback in business sentiment and investment from a sustained conflict is giving the Fed new reason to consider rate cuts.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Generally speaking, the Fed will want to move more quickly than it has in previous cycles to shore up growth at the first hint of any economic contraction because with its short-term benchmark at a historically low range of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2.25% and</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.5%,</span> it doesn’t have as much room to cut rates as in previous downturns.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The upshot is if the administration’s trade uncertainty harms the economy, the Fed may have little choice but to respond by cutting rates.</span> “They can’t play political brinksmanship with the president,” said Ms. Coronado of MacroPolicy Perspectives.

<span id=""54"" class=""red"">On a recent trip through Asia, Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, said he was struck by questions from clients who assumed that the Fed had shifted its footing this year because of Mr. Trump’s pressure.

</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">“People who know the Fed understand that’s not what’s going on, but the further you go from the U.S., the more you hear this,” said Mr. Hooper, a former Fed economist.

</span><span id=""56"" class=""red"">Even if some investors thought the Fed was acting politically by scrapping rate increases, there’s little evidence they believe this was a policy error.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">If they did, this should be reflected in bets on faster inflation, such as rising break-even rates derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities.

</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“That’s when you see people putting money where their mouth is,” said Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed.

</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell has told colleagues they could deal with presidential pestering by giving Mr. Trump what he wants—at tremendous cost to the institution’s hard-won credibility—or by reflexively doing the opposite, burnishing their independence in a foolhardy way that risks recession.</span> The right course, he has said, is to make decisions based on their objective analysis of data—realizing that some calls may look like a concession to the president and others may look like a rebuke.

To tune out politics, Mr. Powell tells associates they must focus on “controlling the controllable,” borrowing a favorite phrase from George Sherman, the former Danaher Corp. chief executive. The two men worked together during Mr. Powell’s past career in private equity.

<span id=""60"" class=""red"">Presidents have long tried to influence the Fed.</span> <span id=""61"" class=""red"">President Nixon pushed his longtime adviser, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns, to stimulate the economy ahead of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1972 election</span>.</span> <span id=""62"" class=""red"">Inflation later accelerated.

</span><span id=""63"" class=""red"">President George H.W. Bush and his advisers frequently said the Fed kept too tight a grip on the money supply because of its preoccupation with inflation.</span> Then-Chairman Greenspan wasn’t swayed.

Over lunch last fall, Mr. Greenspan discussed with Mr. Powell the advice he offers anyone when asked about dealing with the White House: Wear earmuffs.

<span id=""64"" class=""red"">Since the 1990s, the Fed and central banks in other democracies have operated with greater political independence.</span> Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz carries around a fortune from a cookie at a Chinese-Thai restaurant in Ottawa that reads, “You are independent politically.” He keeps it in a plastic sleeve in his wallet.

Such institutional autonomy annoys Mr. Trump. <span id=""65"" class=""red"">He told advisers he is more concerned about the Fed’s rate increases hurting the economy than about any disruption from higher tariffs.</span> In complaining that Mr. Powell lacks a “feel” for the markets, he likened him to a golfer who can’t putt.

Though Mr. Powell almost never refers to Mr. Trump by name, he has indicated to lawmakers and colleagues that he recognizes an important part of his four-year term will be to shield the institution from any political pressure.

“We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work,” Mr. Powell said at a January news conference. “We’re human. We make mistakes. <span id=""66"" class=""red"">But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity.”

Mr. Powell, who began his career as a lawyer, has made clear to associates there aren’t any circumstances under which he would leave his job voluntarily, meaning a court battle would likely ensue should Mr. Trump try to remove him before his term expires <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span>

</span><span id=""67"" class=""red"">People who suspect Mr. Powell will cave to Mr. Trump don’t know the man, said former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher.

</span>He cited, among other things, Mr. Powell’s wealth and his respected stature in Washington. <span id=""68"" class=""red"">Financial disclosures <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 showed</span> Mr. Powell owned assets worth <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $20 million</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $55 million</span>.

</span>“He’s very comfortable in his own skin,” said Mr. Fisher. <span id=""69"" class=""red"">“You or I would probably be a little bit comfortable in our own skin if we had that.”

16694,"<h3>Emails Show The Oil Lobby Mobilized Democratic Governors' Opposition To Biden Energy Order</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Fossil fuel trade groups in Louisiana and New Mexico rallied Democratic governors in opposition to President Joe Biden’s executive order pausing new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and in offshore waters, newly released emails show.
</span>The Biden administration paused new leases on Jan.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27 and</span> launched a major review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. Interior Department officials have said the program currently is “not serving the American public well.”
The behind-the-scenes lobbying included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA) introducing top energy officials in Louisiana and New Mexico to each other. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">LMOGA also provided the Louisiana official with industry talking points about how restricting oil and gas development would hurt the state’s economy, and it helped ghostwrite a letter that Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) sent to Biden arguing, among other things, that confronting climate effects depends on continued offshore fossil fuel development.
</span>The communications highlight the growing role regional industry associations play in fighting climate action as pressure mounts on big-name companies and highly visible national groups to put a softer face on regulatory obstruction.
Edwards and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) have both spoken out against the Biden administration’s leasing freeze, publicly and in letters to the president. Louisiana joined more than a dozen other states in suing the administration over the executive order, and Lujan Grisham requested New Mexico be exempt from the pause because of its climate change initiatives and greenhouse gas emission reductions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Both states are major oil and gas producers and rely heavily on revenue from fossil fuel development.
</span>“These documents show that the Lujan Grisham and Bel Edwards administrations are valuable assets in the oil industry’s fight against President Biden’s public lands policies,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior investigator with the watchdog group Documented.
Documented and the Energy and Policy Institute, another watchdog organization, obtained the communications via state public records requests and shared them exclusively with HuffPost.
The day before Biden was expected to sign his order, Lori LeBlanc, vice president of LMOGA, emailed an Edwards staffer to request a meeting to “discuss the federal executive orders around the leasing and drilling permit bans on federal lands and offshore,” falsely characterizing the upcoming order as an all-out ban. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Documents show she and other representatives of the oil trade group had a Zoom meeting Jan.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27 with</span> Edwards’ staff, including Thomas Harris, secretary of Louisiana’s Department of Natural Resources, and Chip Kline, executive assistant to the governor for coastal activities and the chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Board.
</span>The following day, LMOGA President Tyler Gray copied Harris in an email to Ryan Flynn, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA).
“Perhaps there’s a way that NMOGA and LMOGA can work with the governors of New Mexico and Louisiana to approach the Administration in a collaborative way to give consideration for the critical importance of the natural gas and oil industry in our respective states,” Gray wrote.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Harris promptly responded, thanking Gray for connecting him with the New Mexico trade group.</span> “I appreciate the introduction and look forward to working with NMOGA and Governor Grisham’s staff,” he wrote. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We certainly share a common interest.”
</span>Things progressed quickly from there. Flynn connected Harris with Harris’s counterpart in New Mexico, Sarah Propst, secretary of the state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, as well as Adriene Sandoval, director of the department’s Oil Conservation Division. Propst and Harris agreed to meet the following week, on Feb.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I believe that New Mexico and Louisiana have many shared interest [sic] and that we can work together cooperatively on this and on future issues,” Harris wrote to Propst.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The heads of both industry trade groups were copied on emails throughout the exchange.
</span>On Feb.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> LMOGA connected Harris to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 joined</span> a lawsuit aimed at allowing the government to greenlight oil and gas development on federal lands without considering the effects on the climate. That same day, Harris spoke at a webinar that LMOGA hosted. During the event, he outlined Edwards’s efforts to push back against the leasing freeze and convince the Biden administration that “cutting domestic production is NOT the path forward,” according to prepared talking points obtained through records requests. That effort, he told the industry group, included “listening to the concerns of CEOs and industry representatives,” as well as reaching out to governors, members of Congress and the Biden administration.
Instead of making “public, inflammatory comments that would impair his effectiveness in getting a seat at the table and having our legitimate concerns heard,” Edwards “is trying [to] have actual influence on Federal Energy Policy moving forward,” Harris’s prepared remarks read. “Toward that goal, we would certainly welcome any information, data or talking points that your companies believe might help in that cause. Gov. Edwards is planning to speak to Biden’s [Department of Energy] secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm next week and it is not too late to update his talking points.”
The document goes on to note that during a meeting with LMOGA’s president and other industry leaders the day before, Edwards “instructed” Harris to “work with Tyler [Gray] in drafting a letter for [Edwards’s] signature,” in which the governor would ask the administration to continue issuing permits on existing leases. “We are working with LMOGA staff to craft language for that letter,” Harris’s document says.
Shauna Sanford, a spokesperson for Edwards, told HuffPost the governor’s team regularly seeks input from stakeholders, including industry leaders and community groups, as it works to understand and assess potential effects of federal policy decisions.
“The Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources has expertise in many aspects of the exploration and production but does not regulate or directly interact with [outer continental shelf] energy activity,” she said in an email. “Therefore, Secretary Tom Harris and his staff did vet and make use of information provided by LMOGA that appeared to be verifiable and relevant in creating a draft letter for the Governor’s review. LMOGA was one source of several used by the state in drafting letters written on the subject.”
Sanford confirmed that LMOGA assisted with the letter Edwards sent to Biden on Feb.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> in which the governor swung back against the leasing pause and touted the state’s efforts to address climate change and reduce emissions.
“I urge you to keep in mind that our ability to address Louisiana’s climate related challenges, improve our structural resilience to catastrophic weather events, combat coastal land loss, and reduce our carbon footprint relies heavily on sustainable and predictable oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico,” Edwards wrote. The pause, he added, “creates uncertainty in our coastal planning process.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Of course, business-as-usual fossil fuel production could lock in potentially catastrophic economic and environmental damage not only in Louisiana but also across the globe.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In New Mexico, Lujan Grisham’s staff communicated “frequently with large operators and the trade associations,” including NMOGA and the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, Caroline Buerkle, one of the governor's top staffers, wrote in a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 12 email</span> response to a county official who reached out about Biden’s executive orders.
</span>Though it was LMOGA and NMOGA that connected the New Mexico administration to Louisiana officials, the documents HuffPost reviewed do not show industry associations directly shaping New Mexico’s response in the way that they did Louisiana’s.
“NMOGA and other industry groups have not been involved at all in New Mexico’s response to the Biden administration’s policies and directives,” Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan Grisham, said in an email response. “State officials frequently and productively communicate and collaborate with other states, nonprofits, local government officials as well as industry groups as we not only develop and execute innovative clean-energy policies but ensure federal regulations do not overly or unnecessarily burden New Mexico’s budgetary outlook.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">In addition to a letter Lujan Grisham sent to Biden on <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 15,</span> Propst wrote to top Interior Department officials in February informing them that the leasing pause had resulted in “on-the-ground uncertainties that undermine our ability to safeguard New Mexico’s economy and environment.”
</span>Around the same time that NMOGA was communicating with Lujan Grisham’s office about Biden’s order, the industry association was celebrating its success in lobbying for changes to a proposed state rule regulating methane pollution, as The Guardian reported last week. During a Feb.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 presentation</span> to its board, NMOGA said the state had <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">accepted 72 of</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 173 suggested</span> changes to the rule.
The “process has been fruitful,” the group wrote in its presentation, adding that there had been “significant changes in favor of industry.”

This week, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., one of the front-runners in the race for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, revealed her radical vision for American health care – outlawing private health insurance and putting the government in charge of the system.
Harris, along <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 15 of</span> her Democratic colleagues, supports Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., vision of ""Medicare-for-all."" Sanders'<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>bill</span>, S.1804, was explicit about outlawing private health insurance. At a town hall in Iowa last Monday, Harris confirmed she was on board with that idea. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">In other words, Harris is running for president on a platform of taking away the private insurance coverage of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 million</span> people, and dumping everyone into a one-size-fits-all government-run health plan that would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars.</span> And if the experiences of other countries with single-payer health care are any indication, it would result in long waits for poor care.
I'M <span id=""1"" class=""red"">A DEMOCRAT BUT MEDICARE FOR ALL IS NOT THE ANSWER -- HERE ARE FOUR SUGGESTIONS
Support for single-payer appears to be the price of admission to the Democratic presidential race.</span> Harris's fellow presidential aspirants, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Cory Booker, D.-N.J., were among the co-sponsors of Sanders'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>“Medicare-for-all” legislation. And it's only a matter of time before Sanders himself, the pied piper of the ""Medicare-for-all” movement, joins the race.
""Medicare-for-all’s"" advocates promise a health care system that's free at the point of service – no co-pays, no deductibles, no coinsurance.
They tend to be less upfront about how they'd pay for it. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Independent estimates from both the right and the left peg ""Medicare-for-all’s” cost at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $32 trillion</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10 years</span>.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Doubling what the federal government takes in individual and corporate income tax revenue wouldn't be enough to cover that tab.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">That's assuming “Medicare-for-all” is able to implement its financing strategy.</span> The bill proposes reimbursing doctors and hospitals at Medicare's current rates, which <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 40 percent</span> below what private insurance pays.
Health care providers are unlikely to just absorb those cuts. Those with narrow margins – say, in rural areas – may be forced to close, unable to cover their costs. Some doctors may respond to lower payments by seeing fewer patients, retiring early, or leaving the practice of medicine altogether. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Bright young people may decide not to pursue careers in medicine, given that “Medicare for all” will limit their earning power.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Regardless, ratcheting down the price of care by force is going to cause health care providers to supply less of it.</span> And that will lead to longer waits for patients.
American patients will not stand for the higher taxes and lower-quality care that “Medicare-for-all” would bring.
Long waits plague patients in other countries with government-run health care. Take Canada, which outlaws private health insurance for anything considered medically necessary, just as “Medicare for all” would. The median wait for treatment from a specialist following referral by a general practitioner <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 19.8 weeks</span>, according to the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank. <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1993,</span> the median wait was less than half as much –<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9.3 weeks</span>.
Waits are far longer for some specialties. For orthopedic surgery, the median wait for specialist treatment <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 39 weeks</span>.
Many Canadians are uninterested in waiting multiple months for treatment, particularly if they're in pain or fear they may have a serious illness. So they pay out of pocket for care abroad. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 63,000 Canadians</span> went to another country to receive medical treatment.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the United Kingdom's government-run, 70-year old National Health Service, is proving similarly incapable of providing quality care. The system is currently <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">short 100,000 health</span> professionals – doctors, nurses and other workers.
It's no <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wonder 14 percent</span> of operations are canceled right before they are supposed to happen, usually due to a shortage of staff or beds. Last July,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.3 million</span> patients were waiting for an operation – the highest figure in a decade.
During the winter, the system goes into crisis mode. Between December<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 </span>and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2018,</span> more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 163,000 patients</span> waited in corridors and ambulances for <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 30 minutes</span> before being admitted to the emergency room. To deal with the crunch, officials ordered hospitals to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cancel 50,000 operations</span>.
American patients will not stand for the higher taxes and lower-quality care that “Medicare-for-all” would bring. A majority of people,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55 percent</span>, erroneously believe that they'd be able to keep their private insurance under such a system. Once they learn it would eliminate private health insurance, support for the idea plummets, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 56 percent</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 37 percent</span>. The same happens after they learn it would require higher taxes.

Seven <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> say they'd oppose “Medicare-for-all” if it led to delays in getting some treatments and tests. Such delays are not hypothetical – they're endemic to single-payer.

ARE DEMS</span> FINALLY READY TO TOSS PELOSI?
House Democrats and House Republicans have inverse problems.
The Republican rank and file is always full of grumbles about their leader, but nobody seems to want to step up and take him on.
Democrats, on the other hand, have plenty of eager usurpers ready to lead the mutiny, but the crew doesn’t seem interested. That may be changing.
In the wake of a mortifying performance before a CNN studio audience including a cringe-inducing response to a rape victim, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is having another bad day.
Rep. Linda Sanchez D-Calif., has joined the ranks of a growing number of Democratic members who say it’s time for 77-year-old Pelosi to hang it up.
In an appearance on C-SPAN, Sanchez said, “I do think we have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus and I do think it’s time to pass a torch to a new generation of leaders and I want to be a part of that transition.”
But like Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio and Rep. Seth Moulton D-Mass., it’s that last part – “I want to be a part of that transition” – that causes problems. Republicans depose first and pick new leaders later.
In the period of time that Pelosi has been the Democratic leader, Republicans have cycled through a basketball teams worth of House leaders. And if you’ve seen John Boehner lately you know why. The reason he’s smiling is because House leadership is a grueling ordeal for Republicans whose own members are beyond insubordinate. They’re just plain mean.
Democrats, on the other hand, are quite congenial with their leaders, so much so that they keep essentially the same team in power after loss, after loss, after loss, after loss.
If you think Paul Ryan would survive as party leader if Republicans lose the House next year you’ve been drinking too many Leinenkugels. But somehow, Pelosi has survived not only losing the majority, but also failing to retake it in three successive cycles.
Pelosi is no small part of why Democrats are in the House minority, to boot. She ran her caucus off a cliff when she was speaker, forcing votes on brutal issues like global warming regulations just to prove a point to the then Democratic president and Senate.
With little to offer and a demonstrable political reliability for Democrats <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> how does she manage to stay on?
Part of it is certainly her abilities to keep the right mix of contentment and fear within her leadership team. Her prodigious fundraising abilities don’t hurt either.
But what it comes down to is that Democrats keep trying to do their rebellions backwards.
Even on the occasions when Republicans had a plan of succession following the ouster or departure of a leader it didn’t work out.
There is a reason Kevin McCarthy hands out Chick-fil-A sandwiches instead of committee chairmanships.
You can blame some of the problems Republicans have had in majority on this defiant spirit, but there might not be any majority at all if it weren’t for it. The placidity of Pelosi’s reign is proof of that.
But if Democrats are beginning to care more about the revolution than who will lead it, she may at last be in for some real trouble.

RUSSIAN HACKERS HIT NSA
The Hill: “Russian state hackers stole a collection of National Security Agency hacking tools and other documents from the personal computer of an agency contractor who had taken the classified documents home from work, reports The Wall Street Journal. The reported breach took place <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 but</span> wasn't discovered until spring of last year. The Journal reports that the hackers identified the documents through Kaspersky Lab antivirus software. The Department of Homeland Security recently barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky products due to security concerns but has been tight-lipped about what intelligence linked the popular, Moscow-based computer security firm to specific intelligence operations. White House cyber czar Rob Joyce has, however, repeatedly said that the Kaspersky Lab software's ability to access files on systems could be a potential way to compromise a system. Kaspersky has denied any involvement with covert government intelligence gathering, although it does work with police to aid in criminal investigations.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Special counsel looks into Trump dossier allegations - Reuters: “The special counsel investigating whether Russia tried to sway <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 U</span>.S. election has taken over FBI inquiries into a former British spy’s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump’s campaign and associates, sources familiar with the inquiry told Reuters.</span> A report compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele identified Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller declined comment. The FBI also declined comment. Three sources with knowledge of Mueller’s probe said his investigators have assumed control of multiple inquiries into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump, a Republican.”
Yates, Bharara say Mueller faces ‘high bar’ proving criminal conduct - WSJ: “Two of the most high-profile law-enforcement officials fired by President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller faces a high bar in proving criminal conduct in his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, addressing the possibility that he may not bring a case. Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, and Preet Bharara, the former Manhattan U.S. attorney, both emphasized in a joint interview Wednesday at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit…”
Corker: Tillerson, Mattis and Kelly ‘help separate our country from chaos’ -Politico: “Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker offered a blunt assessment of the Trump administration on Wednesday, saying his top advisers ‘help separate the country from chaos.’ Corker, addressing an NBC News report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson considered resigning in frustration over his role, painted the former ExxonMobil executive — along with Chief of Staff John Kelly and Secretary of DefenseJames Mattis — as having a calming influence in the administration. ‘I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos,’ Corker told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. The Tennessee senator expressed sympathy for Tillerson, who he said is in an ‘incredibly frustrating place.’<span id=""5"" class=""red"">”
RYAN OPEN TO BANNING ‘BUMP STOCKS’ FOR RIFLES
Reuters: “U.S. lawmakers need to examine ‘bump stock’ gun accessories, devices that enable some guns to be turned into rapid-fire weapons, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryansaid on Thursday, opening the door to possible debate on gun control by the Republican-controlled Congress.</span> ‘Clearly that’s something we need to look into,’ Ryan told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, adding that many lawmakers had not been aware until now that such devices existed. An excerpt from the interview aired on MSNBC. … ‘I didn’t even know what they were until this week,’ Ryan said, referring to bump stocks. ‘I think we’re quickly coming up to speed with what this is.’ His remarks followed a call on Wednesday by the U.S. Senate’s No.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 Republican</span>, John Cornyn, for lawmakers to investigate bump stocks, as Democrats pushed for a ban on the devices.”
GOP senators consider legislation to ban gun devices - Politico: “Top Senate Republicans said Wednesday they are open to considering legislation banning devices that were reportedly used to gun down scores of people in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Bump stocks — also known as ‘slide fire’ devices, which work by rapidly ‘bumping’ the trigger of a semi-automatic weapon to boost the rate of fire — were reportedly used by Stephen Paddock to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">kill 58 people</span> and wound more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 in</span> Sunday’s Las Vegas massacre. No Republican has yet joined Democrats in endorsing a bill targeting bump stocks, but their comments suggest a potential shift in the party’s typically hard-line opposition to gun control measures. Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, has dispatched his staff to research the use of bump stocks and said it would be ‘worthwhile’ to have a hearing on the topic.”
Trump admin was already rolling back gun regulations - WaPo: “But, with less public attention, the Trump administration has eased some gun regulations in recent months. Among them: The Army Corps of Engineers has filed notice in a court case that it is reconsidering a ban on carrying firearms on its land; the Justice Department narrowed its definition of fugitives barred from purchasing weapons; and the Interior Department lifted a federal ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks. A White House official denied any deliberate effort to play down the change to the background-checks policy and declined to comment on that change or others related to guns.”
The Judge’s Ruling: How far is too far - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano battles the question of whether the government can keep us safe or not: “This is not a novel or arcane observation but rather a rational conclusion from knowing history and everyday life. … In America, killers use guns and only stop when they are killed by law-abiding civilians or by the police. The answer to government failure is a candid recognition that in a free society -- one in which we are all free to come and go as we see fit without government inquiry or interference -- we must be prepared for these tragedies.” More here.

FROM THE BLEACHERS
“I have long thought that, perhaps, the only real security solution in a free society is no security solution. That’s not to say that ordinary (and in some cases even extraordinary) security measures shouldn’t be taken to interdict the types of attacks we have seen since 9/11. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But at what cost – both monetary and psychic?</span> Nature has a way to deal with mass attacks in the ocean. It’s the school of fish approach. So, government should be watchful and we, the public, should be cautious; however the current reality is that every now and then the terrorist shark will be successful at gobbling up a few of us. And, like a school of fish, the vast majority will survive with our freedoms intact. I hope I’m not being too crass.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas
[Ed. note: I appreciate the fact that you are wrestling with this balance between freedom and order, as well as the fate of your fellow fish. It is essential for each of us to care deeply and love deeply our fellow human beings as individuals. The hard choices come in, however, when we think about human beings in large numbers. Either deliberately or as a result of unintended consequences, the choices about governments and the actions of those governments once constituted will be bad for some individuals. As we have often discussed, the purpose of a righteous government is to seek to create the proper balance between freedom and order so that human beings are able to realize their greatest potential. If there is too much order, the spirit of the people and their hopes will be crushed. If there is too much freedom, chaos will reign and people will be tyrannized by their neighbors. Fitting firearms into that equation is challenging, but not necessarily more challenging than issues like free speech, free assembly and free commerce. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Each of those things come at a cost to some people, sometimes unto death.</span> It’s not wrong to accept that there are consequences to some individuals as a result of freedom. But I would encourage you to keep a great heart for those little fish lost to our school. We should never be mathematically indifferent to human suffering.]
“The reason I read your halftime report every day is that I can trust you to speak the unvarnished truth. Your reply to Greg Cary [in Wednesday’s Halftime Report] cut through all the smoke. One of the proofs of the cowardice of our politicians is that none of them on either side will come out and say what, I believe, they mean i.e. that either they support the rights of American citizens to own guns to guard against the tyranny of the government (not for hunting, sport or self-defense against a criminal), or that they want to abolish the second amendment in order to disarm the public to promote that tyranny. I no longer own even a shotgun, but I hope enough of my fellow citizens own the most powerful weapons they can still get their hands on legally, to at least give the government pause before further infringing on our God given rights. I hope and pray that armed resistance to the government will never be necessary, but the safest way to assure that it won’t is for there to at least be some doubt what would happen if the government tried.” – Clark R. Acton, Anderson, Ind.
[Ed. note: If we have achieved the status of smoke cutters, then I will consider our work successful indeed. Thanks for reading and taking the time to write.]
“As you rightly pointed out, the Second Amendment, as defined by Mr. Madison, was to prevent such tyranny from arising here, in our newly founded republic. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Yes, the Civil War came about because virtually every man was armed (though weapons manufacturing had to increase as the supply of rifles and ammunition declined through use and wearing out).</span> However, after the war (and the Reconstruction) the rights of southern citizens be armed was returned to them. In the Old West (whatever that really was) a criminal, after surging a sentence (except for hanging sentences) had their weapons returned to them as they left either the risen or country jail or from prison. It wasn’t until the rise of the modern ‘organized criminal gang’ came into existence that ‘guns laws’ became an issue.” – John William Gibson, Coos Bay, Ore.
[Ed. note: Thank you for the history lesson, Mr. Gibson! We often discuss the way gun technology has changed since the founding, but we seldom talk about the way cultural changes have affected the way we see, use and regulate guns.]

ICED NOT ISIS
Fox News: “A 29-year-old man in Switzerland recently received an anonymous letter from his ‘worried’ neighbors after he hung a Jack Daniel’s flag in front of his apartment. Their problem? They mistook the whiskey brand’s logo for the black and white logo of ISIS, and feared the young man may be a supporter of the Islamic State. … According to the paper, the young man — who remained anonymous — had moved to Zurich with his girlfriend a few months back, and decided to hang the Italian flag and a Jack Daniel’s flag in front of his home because he thought it would be ‘funny.’ Now, however, he fears the neighbors have the wrong impression of him. … And as for his Jack Daniel’s flag? The man says he’s not taking it down. It wouldn’t be ‘right’ to give in, he said.”

37263,"<h3>US Supreme Court Rules States Can Require Online Merchants to Collect Sales Tax</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">US Supreme Court Rules States Can Require Online Merchants to Collect Sales Tax
High court overturns pre-internet precedent that limited tax collection
The Supreme Court handed states broad authority Thursday to require online retailers to collect sales taxes, overturning a pre-Internet court precedent that had effectively exempted many merchants from collection duties.
</span>The court, in a 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, ruled that states can require internet merchants to collect the taxes even if the merchant has no physical presence in the state.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The court cited studies suggesting that the current rule costs states up <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $33.9 billion</span> a year in uncollected sales taxes.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Justice Kennedy said the old rule “limited states’ ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.”
</span>The ruling likely will spell the end of an era in which consumers could save on taxes by purchasing goods online instead of from local merchants.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The justices’ decision overturned <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1992 high</span> court ruling involving mail-order businesses that said states can only require tax collection by merchants who are physically located in the state’s borders.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The ruling is a victory for states that argued tax-free internet sales were costing them billions of dollars in revenue.</span> It is also a big win for brick-and-mortar stores, which have to compete against online rivals that don’t have to collect the taxes on internet purchases.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some large online retailers, such as Amazon.com Inc., already collect state sales tax on products they sell directly, but others don’t.</span> Amazon also hasn’t collected the taxes for most independent merchants who sell items on Amazon’s platform.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The case before the high court was brought by the state of South Dakota, which enacted a law <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 that</span> required merchants to collect the tax.</span> The state then set the stage for test litigation by suing out-of-state online sellers including Wayfair Inc., Overstock.com Inc. and Newegg Inc.
The companies’ stocks moved lower after the decision was released. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Amazon’s was down a little more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1%,</span> while Wayfair’s stock dropped <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 7% before</span> recovering slightly.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Etsy ’s stock fell <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5%,</span> and eBay ’s was down <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2% in</span> recent trading.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">State legislators and big-box stores had been unsuccessful for years in pushing Congress to give states the authority to require sales-tax collection.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The U.S. Senate passed a bill <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> but it died in the House, caught in a fight between anti-tax Republicans and Republicans who back the brick-and-mortar retailers.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Thursday’s opinion is likely to spur a new push for a federal law to limit states’ ability to require tax collection by small businesses and to restrain cross-border audits.</span> This time, however, it will be Internet retailers and catalog businesses seeking guardrails on state action, and they’ll have the burden of mustering majorities in a Congress.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">“We are now really comfortable with Congress continuing its path of not acting on this issue,” said Max Behlke, director of budget and tax policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</span>States are expected to examine their existing laws and consider implementing new ones, Mr. Behlke said. “It’s not like tomorrow the world’s going to change. But in the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 60 days</span>, I think we’ll see states start to move forward,” he said.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Steve Delbianco, president of NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group, said Congress should act immediately to create rules for states and retailers to follow.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">“A brick-and-mortar business won’t have to comply with the differing rules of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 12,000 tax</span> jurisdictions, or integrate costly and complex tax software into its operations,” Mr. Delbianco said in a statement.</span> “But small web businesses will, eating away at their already razor-thin profit margins. When these businesses disappear, consumers will be the biggest losers.”
The decision produced an unusual split among the justices. Joining Justice Kennedy were three of his conservative colleagues, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, as well as liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Justice Kennedy’s opinion eliminates the physical-presence test but doesn’t set out a bright-line rule about exactly when a state’s sales-tax collection law might impose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Justice Kennedy did note that the South Dakota law at issue wouldn’t apply retroactively, included an exception for small business and offered retailers software and clear definitions to help merchants comply with the sales tax requirement.
</span>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the dissenters, joined by liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">“E-commerce has grown into a significant and vibrant part of our national economy against the backdrop of established rules, including the physical-presence rule,” the chief justice wrote.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">“Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress.”

69636,"<h3>Ukraine Crisis Is a Call to Rethink Energy Policies</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Hedge-Fund Managers Offer Up Investment Ideas at Annual Sohn Conference

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 6</span>:54 pm ET

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said the Australian dollar's skid is far from over and recommended investors bet against the currency.

</span>The prediction, and pitch, were one of a slew Wednesday at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, where some of the world's best-known hedge-fund managers get <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 15 minutes</span> to make their best case for an investment idea or two. The annual conference, made famous by some presentations including David Einhorn'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2008 takedown</span> of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before it filed for bankruptcy protection, is a benefit that raises money for the treatment of pediatric cancer and other childhood illnesses.

Among the other pitches Wednesday: Steve Eisman touted U.S. home-building stocks, James Chanos made a bearish case against Seagate Technology PLC, STX -0.36%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Kyle Bass praised a yellow-pages company formed out of a merger of two recently bankrupt peers. Mr. Bass, who has profited from betting against the Japanese yen, also predicted the yen could decline to the ¥120-range against the dollar. Late Wednesday in New York, the dollar bought ¥99.02, compared with ¥99 late Tuesday.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Druckenmiller said he expects the Australian central bank will lower interest rates further, which will weigh on the value of the country's currency.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His prediction comes the day after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a record low and warned that the strong Australian dollar was hampering growth.

</span>""We think the Australian dollar...will come down and will come down hard,"" Mr. Druckenmiller said, while adding investors should avoid commodity currencies like Brazil and Canada. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Australian dollar, known as the Aussie, is trading near a two-month low and has dropped more <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% in</span> the past month.</span> Late Wednesday, the Aussie was <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.0171,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.0185 late</span> Tuesday.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">At a competing event, the SALT hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas, participants generally were upbeat about the U.S. economy and stock market, with a number comparing the environment to the late 1990s, when the country pulled ahead of other nations in economic growth.</span> However, some pointed to Japan as an area of profit for many hedge funds lately.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, in New York, Mr. Eisman, who made a fortune betting against the U.S. housing market in the past decade, has turned positive on U.S. housing but made a case that Canada is now replicating U.S. mistakes.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said he has stakes in Lennar Corp., Standard Pacific Corp. and PulteGroup Inc., saying that while home-building stocks are no longer cheap, some have yet to price in improved fundamentals.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He also called mortgage-finance company Ocwen Financial Corp. one of the best ways to bet on the U.S. market.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">As for Canada, Mr. Eisman painted a picture of misaligned government policy and support that has created a bubble in the country's housing market.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">While he didn't specify if he was betting against any stock, Mr. Eisman singled out for criticism mortgage originator Home Capital Group Inc., which trades in Toronto.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""If housing rolls over, this company is going to have problems,"" he said.</span> A representative for Home Capital Group couldn't be reached for comment.

On Seagate, Mr. Chanos didn't disclose if he had an actual wager against the company. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Among other things behind his thinking, he said, the business challenges facing personal computers were even more pronounced for hard-disk drives, a main Seagate product.</span> A representative for the company couldn't be reached.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Bass, fan of yellow-pages company Dex Media Inc., said that, while the directories business has had its problems, he sees this company as potentially benefiting from ""not printing as many books.""</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said he expects the company, with a market capitalization of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $234 million</span> (a figure that rose on his remarks), to expand its digital business and reduce its debt.

74724,"<h3>Maduro’s muscle: Politically backed motorcycle gangs known as 'colectivos' are the enforcers for Venezuela’s authoritarian leader</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">CARACAS, Venezuela — The neighbors were fed up.</span> For days, they’d had no electricity or running water because of a massive national blackout. So one morning this week, they piled logs and garbage into a makeshift barricade in their middle-class Caracas neighborhood and started yelling slogans against the government.
Then came the motorcycles.
There were at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 of</span> them, their motors buzzing, driven by men with scarves over their faces, according to interviews <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 10 witnesses</span>. The demonstrators scattered. But as people in surrounding buildings started hurling bottles at the bikers, the men raised their weapons — pistols and rifles — and opened fire.
No one was injured. But the neighbors were terrified.
“Now we can’t even protest, because they’ll shoot at us,” said Delia Arellano,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72,</span> one of the demonstrators.
The attack on Sunday was a chilling sign of how President Nicolás Maduro is increasingly relying on paramilitary groups as he clings to power. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This week, he publicly urged the motorcycle-riding “colectivos” to intensify their efforts, as the country teetered on the edge of economic collapse and a U.S.-backed opposition movement pressed for his ouster.
</span>“I call on the colectivos; the hour of resistance has arrived, active resistance in the community,” Maduro declared in the speech on Monday.
The colectivos aren’t nearly as big as Venezuela’s armed forces — they number <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perhaps 5,000 to</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,500 members</span> nationwide, most of them in cities, according to Alejandro Velasco, a history professor at New York University who has studied the phenomenon. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But they help explain how Maduro has remained in power even as the country’s economy and poorly maintained power grid have broken down.</span> The paramilitary forces are nimble and committed — and they have an extraordinary ability to sow terror.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">[Goodbye Venezuela: When U.S. Embassy staffers leave, they destroy documents and remove the flag]
Ingrid Maldonado witnessed Sunday’s clash between the neighbors and colectivos in Chacao, a business district of apartment buildings, offices and hotels in eastern Caracas.
</span>“Before, government repression just meant tear gas,” said Maldonado,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49.</span> “Now there are bullets. It’s different. You think twice about going out.”
The colectivos have their roots in the Cuban-inspired guerrilla forces that battled Venezuela’s staunchly anti-communist governments in the 1960s. After that conflict, some former rebels returned to poor neighborhoods determined to spread socialism through community activities — offering classes, showing movies, giving out free bread — and to protect residents from corrupt police.
Under the “Bolivarian revolution” of Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s predecessor, the number of these small armed groups grew. Some were permitted to control neighborhoods and run criminal rackets such as drug trafficking and extortion, analysts say. In return, they rounded up votes and provided other political support.
But Chávez, who ruled <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1999 until</span> his death <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> was popular. He wasn’t as dependent on the colectivos.
“He didn’t need to use violence,” said Rafael Uzcátegui, coordinator of the human rights group Provea. “Chávez could maintain political control of the country.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Maduro, in contrast, is widely reviled for the economic mismanagement that has brought hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine to this oil-rich nation.
</span>“That’s why resorting to violence and intimidation has been so important,” Uzcátegui said.
Venezuela’s Ministry of Communications did not respond to a request for comment.
[How Nicolás Maduro has been able to cling to power]
Over the past several years, a new kind of colectivo has emerged, composed of current or former police personnel or government bodyguards.
“Their primary allegiance is not to ‘chavismo’ or an ideological project or a radical leftist vision of change, but basically to stay in power,” Velasco said.
And “power,” for colectivos, often means access to government funds or goods. While it is difficult to pin down the groups’ exact ties to the state, some have been put in charge of the distribution of government food packages in poor areas — giving them control over hungry neighborhoods. Some might be paid by individuals in the government, analysts say.
The colectivos vary widely in their activities and organization. One group of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 100 black</span>-helmeted riders in dark clothing roars regularly through the colonial center of Caracas, near the Miraflores presidential palace, waving the giant red flags of the ruling Socialist party. They are an intimidating sight — even if they don’t flash their weapons.
Others don’t hesitate to threaten violence. Recently, a community activist in the poor Caracas neighborhood of La Vega was leaving a meeting about organizing a teachers strike. Armed men on motorcycles roared up and demanded to know what he was doing, said the activist, José Gregorio Velásquez. They warned him against closing off streets for protests. “We know where you live,” the men said, according to Velásquez.
That sort of grass-roots control could discourage poor Venezuelans from joining the protests that have swept the country in recent weeks in support of Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized by the United States and dozens of other countries as the legitimate president.
While middle-class Venezuelans turn out, Velasco said, “it’s difficult for Guaidó to have the barrios rise up. They are bearing the brunt of the oppression.”
[Has the Venezuelan opposition lost its momentum?]
The paramilitary groups are effective in part because they enjoy impunity. While the traditional colectivos were embedded in their communities, many of the newer ones aren’t, and it’s difficult for citizens to identify their members. They mask their faces, and their motorcycles often lack license plates. As political instability grows, even bands of car thieves or other criminals are calling themselves ‘colectivos,’ said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University.
“They fulfill the classic work of paramilitaries, doing violent security tasks that security agents in uniform would be held accountable for,” he said.
Perhaps the colectivos’ most important weapon, though, is their ability to sow fear.
Roberto Patiño, an opposition activist, helped lead demonstrations on Feb.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 in</span> the Venezuelan border city of Ureña aimed at pressuring security forces to allow humanitarian aid to cross from Colombia. When the Venezuelan National Guard launched tear gas, he said, the crowd persisted.
But then the colectivos turned up, firing their weapons.
“Most people fled to save themselves,” Patiño said. “There was a high risk of being killed.”
The colectivos have become particularly important as the government appears hesitant to use the army to put down demonstrations. While the military leadership has been loyal to Maduro, many rank-and-file soldiers are suffering the same hunger as other Venezuelans — and could defy orders.
The government has also turned to a relatively new branch of the national police, the Special Actions Force (known by its Spanish initials, FAES) to intimidate and kill young protesters in poor neighborhoods, according to human rights groups. Some activists say the new branch works closely with colectivos. The FAES says it is only going after criminals.
The clash in Chacao on Sunday was unusual in that it took place in wealthier East Caracas. Two bakery workers watched as neighbors threw up the barricade across Guaicaipuro Street at the intersection with a major avenue, Francisco de Miranda. At one point, a black government pickup truck tried to pass, the workers said, but the neighbors wouldn’t allow it.
About a half-hour later, the colectivo roared up and the protesters scattered. As residents of apartments yelled and tossed bottles at the motorcyclists, the workers said, the leader of the colectivo issued an order: “Let them have it.”
The motorcyclists opened fire, witnesses said, and eventually dismantled the barricade.
“I don’t think the neighbors of Chacao will go out again to protest,” said 18-year-old Ricardo Linares, one of the bakery workers.
“I’m not afraid to protest,” insisted Junaiker Martínez, a 19-year-old co-worker. “It’s the only power we have. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But I’m not going to go out there alone.”

Atlanta-based food pantry chief calls on Congress, Biden admin to help as prices and demand surge

71170,"<h3>Most REITs Have Dodged the Retail Storm So Far, Report Says</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Despite struggles at many U.S. malls, most of the retail REITs continue to maintain high occupancy rates

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 1,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:54 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The balance sheets of many of the largest U.S. mall owners have managed to dodge much of the carnage in the retail world caused by failing retailers, according to a new report by Moody’s Investors Service.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Struggling retailers like Sears Holdings Corp. and Toys R Us Inc. account for <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 3.9% of</span> the total leasable space in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 22 retail</span> real-estate investment trusts that Moody’s tracks.</span> Only two REITs tracked by Moody’s—CBL & Associates and Washington Prime—face an exposure of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10%,</span> a level the ratings company deems to be “significant.”

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">What’s more, most of the retail REITs continue to maintain high occupancy rates and rent space for average rents that are above the rents in expiring leases, Moody’s said.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Failing retailers have limited impact on rated retail REITs’ operating performance, with the effects concentrated in weak malls,” the report said.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Retail property has been the pariah of the real-estate industry in recent years as online competition has siphoned away business.</span> Mall and shopping center landlords have suffered overall as many of the biggest retailers have failed or contracted.

But the Moody’s report illustrates that some landlords are being hurt more than others. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The average occupancy rate for the retail REITs rated by the firm <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeded 96% at</span> the end <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017,</span> the report said.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We’re not saying we’re bullish on retail.</span> By no means,” said Philip Kibel, a Moody’s associate managing director. “We’re saying from a credit perspective, we’re not as concerned with these [REITs].”

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">That is largely because many of their properties are in strong locations that still enjoy high demand from retailers.</span> Through smart management, landlords can use their top properties to fuel leasing at more vulnerable properties, the report points out.

“REITs can help their weaker tenants by strategically relocating stores to shopping centers with greater traffic,” the report said. This tactic gives REITs the ability “to negotiate with tenants to keep stores open in less robust locations and reduce vacancies.”

Also some expanding retailers are making up for those that are struggling traditional big box and anchor stores. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Replacement tenants include movie theaters and other “experience-oriented” tenants and off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Ross Dress for Less, Moody’s said.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Of course, not all is cheery even among the stronger retail REITs.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">For one thing, stock investors have tended to paint the entire sector with a broad brush.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">As of Tuesday, mall and strip center REITs were trading <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 21.6% and</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.5% discounts</span> to the value of their assets, according to Green Street Advisors.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The overall REIT market was at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 8.5% discount</span>, the firm said.

</span>At the same time, some of the rental growth among the Moody’s rated malls has slowed. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> the so-called “leasing spread”—the difference between the average rent in new leases versus expiring leases—<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 9.6%.</span> That was down from <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 11.1% those</span> REITs chalked up <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

Moody’s downgraded its credit rating of CBL in February and changed its rating outlook of Washington Prime to negative from stable in <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017.</span> “There’s a big difference between them and Simon [Properties],” Mr. Kibel said.

But Moody’s pointed out that many REITs have shored up their balance sheets by reducing leverage. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">That, coupled with positive cash flow, “will provide the REITs with financial flexibility to develop and redevelop their portfolios to attract tenants,” the report said.

36334,"<h3>Imran Khan Declares Victory In Disputed Pakistan Election</h3>ISLAMABAD, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26 </span>(Reuters) - Pakistani cricket legend Imran Khan declared victory on Thursday in a divisive general election, and said he was ready to lead the nuclear-armed nation despite a long delay in ballot counting and allegations of vote-rigging from his main opponents.

His success in Wednesday’s election is a stunning rise for an anti-corruption crusader who has spent much of his political career on the fringes of Pakistan politics, but now stands on the brink of becoming the country’s prime minister.

“God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology which I <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">started 22 years</span> ago,” Khan,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 65,</span> said in a televised speech from his house near the capital Islamabad.

Supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who accuse Khan of colluding with the still powerful army, said the vote count was rigged in what it termed an assault on democracy in a country with a history of military rule.

Oxford-educated Khan, in the past a fierce critic of U.S. policy in the region, called for “mutually beneficial” ties with Pakistan’s on-off ally the United States, and offered an olive branch to arch-foe India, saying the two nations should resolve their long-simmering dispute over Kashmir.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">In a speech peppered with populist pledges, Khan promised to create jobs for the poor and said he would turn the palatial prime minister’s official residence in the capital into an education facility instead of living in it.

</span>With about half the votes counted, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice, had a wide lead in the Muslim-majority nation, the country’s election commission said.

Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and rival Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) both said their party monitors at many voting centers were either kicked out during counting or had not received the official notifications of the precinct’s results, instead being given handwritten tallies they could not verify.

“It is a sheer rigging. The way the people’s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,” Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N president and Nawaz’s brother, told a news conference.

Khan has staunchly denied allegations by PML-N that he is getting help from the military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its history and still sets key security and foreign policy.

The army, which dismisses allegations of meddling, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">deployed 371,000 soldiers</span> at polling stations across the country, nearly five times the number as in last election <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013.</span>

Khan offered to investigate all the allegations of rigging and said he wants to “unite” the country under his leadership.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Pakistan faces a mounting economic crisis that is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the likely conditions of which could complicate Khan’s spending pledges.</span> PTI has also not ruled out seeking succor from China, Islamabad’s closest ally which has in recent years been investing heavily in infrastructure in the country.

Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) secretary Babar Yaqoob told reporters early on Thursday that counting had been delayed by technical failures in an electronic reporting system and the tallying was now being conducted manually. The results had been due by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2 a</span>.m. (2100 GMT on Wednesday).

By early Thursday evening, a full day after polls closed, he told <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reporters 82 percent</span> of results had been received and rejected the allegations of tampering in the vote count.

“The complaints we have been receiving, they could be of procedural level, but not any kind of rigging,” Yaqoob said.

<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">With 48 percent</span> of the total vote counted, Khan’s PTI was listed by the ECP in its provisional results as leading <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 113 of</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 272 contested</span> National Assembly constituencies.

Sharif’s PML-N was ahead <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 64 constituencies</span>, and the PPP, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, led <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 42 constituencies</span>.

Although Khan still appeared likely to fall short of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 137 seats</span> needed for a majority in the National Assembly, he should have no problems finding coalition partners from smaller parties and independents.

Pakistan’s election monitoring body and the European Union’s were scheduled to deliver their assessments of the conduct of the election on Friday.

An icon of Pakistani cricket and a one-time London playboy who has since transformed himself into a pious, firebrand nationalist, Khan’s campaign speeches were littered with anti-America rhetoric and baiting of India.

But in his victory speech, Khan pledged to improve ties with Washington and Pakistan’s neighbors at a time the country is becoming increasingly isolated over its alleged links with Islamist militants in Afghanistan.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">He called for a “balanced relationship” with the United States, which has taken a firmer line on Pakistan under President Donald Trump, suspending aid and even convincing Western allies to putPakistan on a terror financing watchlist earlier this year.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Quipping that Indian media had recently portrayed him like a “villain in a Bollywood movie,” Khan’s overtures to New Delhi included calls for better trade ties and to sit down and discuss Kashmir, a disputed region that was the cause of two of the three wars between the neighbors.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Khan also said he wants deepen ties with old ally Beijing and emulate China’s success in reducing poverty.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Investors welcomed Khan’s election success, with Pakistan’s benchmark 100-share index surging as much <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1.9 percent</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 42,136 points</span> in early trade, before <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closing 1.8 percent</span> up.</span> Analysts said there was relief Khan was unlikely to have to rely on major opposition parties in a messy coalition.

Khan has promised an “Islamic welfare state” and cast his campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished nation <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 208 million</span>, where the illiteracy rate hovers <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 40 percent</span>.

“Accountability will start with me, then my ministers, and then we will work our way down,” Khan said. “I want all of Pakistan to be united in this moment.”

26571,"<h3>Coronavirus: Trump stands by China lab origin theory for virus</h3>Coronavirus: Trump stands by China lab origin theory for virus
US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.
Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began.
But the office said it had determined Covid-19 ""was not manmade or genetically modified"".
China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19.
Since emerging in China last year, the virus has <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 230,000 people</span> worldwide <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 63,000 in</span> the US.
The pandemic has seen at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 3.2 million</span> people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan.
What did Trump say?
At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: ""Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?""
""Yes, I have. Yes, I have,"" said the president, without specifying. ""And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.""
Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.""
He also told reporters: ""Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose?
""I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.""
The New York Times reported on Thursday that senior White House officials had asked the US intelligence community to investigate whether the virus came from a Wuhan research laboratory.
Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News.
What did the intelligence service say?
In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins.
- <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea?
- China and the US trade coronavirus conspiracy theories
""The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.</span>""
It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon.
What is the Wuhan lab?
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Level 4 lab</span>oratory</span>.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats.
Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports.
It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Level 4 lab</span> with links to similar labs around the world.
What are Trump's accusations against China?
Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing.
On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November.
He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading.
He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body.
China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis.
A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations.
</span>How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before?
In January, he called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea.
His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign.
He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens.
The right moment for this fight?
President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead.
Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight.
China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game.
</span>Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.

37311,"<h3>Miner Freeport Pressured by Water Costs as Copper Prices Slide</h3>Companies Spend Billions on Water as They Probe Remote, Dry Areas for Increasingly Scarce Minerals

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 20,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 10</span>:32 pm ET

MORENCI, Ariz.—Two years ago, Freeport-McMoRan Inc., FCX -2.55%decrease; red down pointing triangle one of the world's top copper miners, paid 69-year-old cowboy Richard <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kaler $1.3 million</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 280 acres</span> of rocky ranchland in the eastern Arizona desert.

Freeport isn't interested in his minerals. Instead, it wants his rights to fresh water, which it needs to expand production at North America's biggest copper mine, spread <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 65,000 acres</span> nearby. Freeport aims to unearth almost one billion pounds of copper a year—37% of current U.S. annual output—at the Morenci, Ariz., mine <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2016.</span>

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The success of the Phoenix-based miner, which had profit <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.7 billion</span> on revenue <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $20.9 billion</span> last year, hinges on its ability to secure and maintain water supplies in arid areas where copper is found.</span> It requires heavy spending and delicate negotiations to minimize potential conflicts with local farmers and others who also need water.

It's not alone. As mining companies probe remote areas for increasingly scarce minerals, they are investing billions of dollars for water. Moody's Investors Service estimates that mining companies <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $12 billion</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> three times as much <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 2009,</span> on water management, including treatment facilities and pipelines.

The issue is especially crucial for copper. Around half the world's copper comes from a belt running from Utah to Chile under mountainous, dry areas, and costs for water are expanding. The Chilean parliament is considering forcing mining companies to build desalinization plants, which remove salt from ocean water, rather than use fresh ground and surface water for their operations. BHP Billiton Ltd., another top copper producer, and its partners agreed to build <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3.43 billion</span> desalinization plant for its massive copper mine in Chile's Atacama desert. Freeport in Chile recently completed <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $315 million</span> desalinization plant and pipeline. And in Peru, it is building <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $340 million</span> sewage treatment plant.

""Water is a critical issue in places like Northern Chile and Southern Peru, and here in New Mexico and Arizona,"" Freeport Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Water management costs are adding to pressure on copper miners amid a slide in prices—<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 32% since</span> highs reached in 2011—deflated by weaker demand, especially in China.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 a</span> pound, prices are still higher than Freeport's extraction costs in North America <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.87 a</span> pound, and up from prices that hovered <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $1.50 a</span> pound in the 1990s.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Analysts say copper prices are relatively resilient, because quality deposits are limited and the metal is essential to a wide variety of goods, from water pipes to iPhones.</span> Analysts say Freeport isn't at risk of having to close mines for lack of water, but having to increase spending on water could drive up miners' costs.

China, the world's second-largest copper producer <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1.65 million</span> tons a year <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> has tripled production <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2003.</span> The country doesn't have water problems in its copper-mining areas. No.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 producer</span> Chile, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5.7 million</span> tons a year, has increased <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">output 17% in</span> that time.

Production growth in the U.S., the world's fourth-largest copper producer <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 1.22 million</span> tons <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span></span> has been flat in the past decade. Two-thirds of that annual output is pulled from Arizona.

Freeport's Morenci mine and its other four mines in Arizona <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">produce 30% of</span> the company's copper output, and all are at risk of losing currently available water supplies. If they do, Freeport would be forced ""to curtail operations, preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs,"" the company said in a February SEC filing.

In the U.S., mineral extraction consumes around four billion gallons of water a day. For comparison, industry <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">uses 18.2 billion</span> gallons, all domestic households <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">use 29.4 billion</span> and agriculture <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">uses 128 billion</span> gallons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's most recent survey published <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span></span>

Context is important, though. ""It's not that mining companies use a lot of water, but they tend to mine in rocky places without a lot of water,"" said Mike Lacey, the director of water resources for Arizona.

Water is needed to control dust kicked up during open-pit mining and to extract minerals from rock using various flotation methods in which minerals float or sink.

As most available minerals are taken, what is left tends to be of lower grade, meaning that more rocks must be extracted and more water used to process them. ""If you <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extract 100,000 tons</span> of raw copper <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 0.2% instead</span> <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2% grade</span> copper, you <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">need 10 times</span> as much rock <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 10 times</span> as much water,"" said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein. ""Water is one of the biggest things mining companies have to worry about, and it's going to get worse.""

Water's scarcity in Arizona has drawn mining companies into conflict with other big consumers of water, mainly farms. In Saharuita, near Tucson, Green Valley Pecan Co., one of the world's largest pecan farms and one of the state's biggest water consumers, has filed legal motions to try to block Canada's Augusta Resource Corp. from building a planned mine. ""It would be adding new, unlimited use of water,"" said Nan Walden, vice president of Green Valley Pecan. ""We're all going to have to pay more for water,"" but a new copper mine added to the two others nearby, including one owned by Freeport, would exhaust supplies, she said.

Augusta Resource says it is minimizing water impact with a new tailings method, planting grass and grazing cattle, and by building <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $22 million</span> water pipeline into the mine <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9 miles</span> away. ""We want zero net impact on the local aquifer,"" said spokesman Dan Ryan.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mines' voracious appetite for water drives up prices and occasionally pollutes local water supplies, said Roger Featherstone, director of the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, an environmental and mining watchdog group.</span> ""But mining companies always have a way of getting the water they need,"" he adds.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Freeport's Mr. Adkerson said managing water sustainably for the surrounding community and preventing pollution ""are just as important as the technical aspects of our business.</span>""

Morenci, a dusty mining outpost <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4,000 set</span> among cactuses and mesquite, receives an average <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 inches</span> of rainfall a year, compared <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 40 inches</span> for New York. Residents say all but one piece of property—a small bar—in the little community is owned and controlled by Freeport. Everything else, from the RadioShack and the motel to the Chinese restaurant and the pizza parlor, is on Freeport land. There is no mayor.

Two of Freeport's principal strategies in Arizona, it says, are buying private farmland, and cutting water-rights deals with local Native American tribes.

""It's a question of finding ways we can make an arrangement for [Native Americans] to give us access to some of their unused water rights,"" said Mr. Adkerson. In January, Freeport hired the state's former water director to help secure rights.

For decades, Freeport and its predecessor company, Phelps Dodge, have had agreements to buy water rights from the San Carlos Apache tribe, which is centered in the town of San Carlos about two hours from the mine. <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 15,000</span>-member tribe <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">occupies 1.8 million</span> acres in southeastern Arizona and is one of the poorest communities in the nation with median household income <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $27,000 a</span> year.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">In <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2013,</span> as part of its latest pact, Freeport agreed to pay the tribe <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $43 million</span> to help Freeport ""increase its water supply <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 75,000 acre</span>-feet"" in total, according to documents the tribe shared with The Wall Street Journal.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The deal means Freeport has the right to use that amount of water, which is enough to <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cover 75,000 acres</span> of land with a foot of water and can supply a normal-size copper mine for three years, according to mining engineers.</span> Freeport declined to comment on the deal, citing a confidentiality agreement. Tribal chairman Terry Rambler declined to add further details about the deal.

Freeport also committed to <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">training 16 Apaches</span> every month for three years for its Morenci, Safford and Miami mines, and helped convert a local school into a training center—the football field is now stacked with bales of hay that are used to train people to use Caterpillar forklifts.

The training plan would amount to <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 550 people</span>, but few San Carlos Apaches end up among <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2,900 who</span> work at the Morenci mine. The two-hour drive to Morenci makes it expensive and cumbersome to get to work there, say tribe members.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Alexander Baylish,<span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> completed the course and quickly found a job working in smelter maintenance for Freeport <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $17 an</span> hour.</span> He currently works at the Miami mine, which is <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 40 minutes</span> away, meaning he can live at home, where he has four children. He said others working at the Morenci mine only come home on weekends. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""This is the best job you can get around here,"" he said.</span> ""A quarter of the people taking classes don't have high-school degrees.""

In addition, Freeport said it has paid <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $81 million</span> <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 23,000 acres</span> in the past five years ""for the primary purpose of acquiring water rights."" Arizona law allows mining companies to use as much groundwater as they can, and then allocates water from rivers and lakes based on how much landowners have used in the past. After Freeport transfers the land's water rights to the mine, it leases the acreage to farmers and ranchers.

Mr. Kaler, the 69-year-old rancher, was a career phone technician from Illinois when he bought his ranch along the San Francisco River <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002.</span> He rode horses and learned how to herd cattle. ""After my whole life of dreaming about it, I finally became a cowboy,"" he said.

<span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2009,</span> when copper prices jumped, Freeport asked him if he wanted to sell.</span> Mr. Kaler said <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 90 acre</span>-feet of water a year attached to his plot of land were especially valuable because they were essentially permanent—they predated Arizona statehood <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1912 and</span> thus couldn't be lost in a legal challenge.

Mr. Kaler was on the fence, but after his wife was killed in a car accident <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> he decided to sell. Freeport paid <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">him $1.3 million</span>, according to county records, which he used to buy another ranch. He also leased his old land back from Freeport, and uses both ranches to farm <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 head</span> of organic Angus beef cattle. ""I'm still a cowboy,"" he said.

95268,"<h3>Gays can be reformed, just like arsonists, Trump’s new domestic policy adviser has said</h3>Ken Blackwell, tapped last week by President-elect Donald Trump to head domestic policy during the businessman's transition to the White House, has made anti-LGBT statements for years. Among them: Homosexuality is a sin, and gay people, just like petty thieves and fire-setters, can be rehabilitated.
The Ohio politician has long endorsed a controversial mental health practice known as conversion therapy or reparative therapy. The goal is to cure a person of his or her homosexuality, and in the case of transgender people, to reaffirm the gender into which they were born.
In the past, treatments have included everything from inducing vomiting to using mild electric shock while patients viewed homoerotic images. Since the 1990s, however, the therapy has been denounced by many medical and scientific societies and even outlawed in a handful of states. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span></span> the Obama administration expressed disapproval of the practice after Leelah Alcorn, a 17-year-old transgender teen in Ohio, took her life after being forced by her parents to undergo conversion counseling.
While Blackwell will be overseeing a wide swath of domestic issues facing the new administration, one big question facing the LGBT community is whether a Trump administration will promote the discredited therapy.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Two years ago, in a radio interview with Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Blackwell appeared to blame the deaths of six individuals in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2014 mass</span> shooting in Isla Vista, Calif., on the LGBT rights movement, saying it undermined ""natural marriage.</span>""
""When these fundamental institutions are attacked and destroyed and weakened and abandoned,"" said Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, ""you get what we are now seeing, and that is a flood of these disturbed people in our society that are causing great pain.""
[Religious leaders try to reverse Illinois ban against conversion therapy]
In an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006,</span> the former Ohio secretary of state claimed that being gay was a “choice” that could be “changed.”
“I think it's a transgression against God's law,” he told the Columbus Dispatch at the time. “And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one's genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think they can be changed? Yes.”
And <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> on Michelangelo Signorile's radio show, Blackwell reaffirmed his stance, saying, ""People choose to be who they are, as they choose to break civil law and God's law. ... I think you can choose not to be homosexual.""
The American Psychiatric Association de-pathologized homosexuality <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1973,</span> when it was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Other professional groups quickly followed suit:
- <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1975,</span> the American Psychological Association urged its members to help remove the stigma of illness from gay people.
- <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1981,</span> the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses.
- <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1994,</span> the American Medical Association released a report calling for “nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation.”
- And on <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 26,</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> in Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of same-sex marriage, writing that being gay was “a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable.”
[Meet Kate Brown: First openly LGBT person elected governor of a state]
Vice President-elect Mike Pence has also appeared to support conversion therapy. When he was running for Congress <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000,</span> Pence's website declared that money set aside by the federal CARE Act, to help indigent HIV/AIDS patients, also be ""directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" (The Trump transition team has not responded for a request for comment.)
<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> freelance investigative journalist John Becker went undercover and secretly filmed a conversion therapy session at a Christian counseling clinic run by Marcus Bachmann, husband of former Minnesota representative Michele Bachmann.
Experts around the world have condemned conversion therapy as not only lacking empirical validity but as unhealthy, especially for young people, causing depression, anxiety, addiction and even suicide.
At least five states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation forbidding mental health professionals from offering conversion therapy to minors. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled that a conversion therapy group called JONAH had violated the state's consumer protection statute by fraudulently advertising a cure for being gay.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The judge also found the group's business practices ""unconscionable.""</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As part of the settlement, in which JONAH was ordered to pay more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3.5 million</span> in legal fees and damages, the organization also was forced out of business and its therapists barred from practicing or even promoting conversion therapy in New Jersey.
</span>[After suicide of transgender girl, Obama condemns conversion therapy]
Douglas Haldeman, a psychologist in Seattle, has written frequently on the topic. The term “reparative therapy” “inaccurately implies 'broken-ness' as the distinctive feature of homosexuality and bisexuality,” he wrote in the book ""Homosexuality: Research Implications for Public Policy."" <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The promotion of reparative or conversion therapy goes beyond its obvious market of disaffected lesbian, gay and bisexual people.</span> This campaign attempts to influence public opinion and justify anti-gay discrimination by inaccurately portraying homosexuality as a mental disorder and a social evil. Conversion therapy, then, is more than just a clinical issue. It figures prominently in the national debate over lesbian and gay civil rights.”
<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1999,</span> a report titled “Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation” was released specifically denouncing reparative therapy as having little or no effectiveness and instead contributing to discrimination against LGBT people. It was co-signed <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 10 prestigious</span> organizations: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Association of School Administrators, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Psychological Association, the American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance, the National Association of School Psychologists, the National Association of Social Workers and the National Education Association.

GOP Governor Closes Polling Gap as Transgender Demand Mobilizes Conservative Voters</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">North Carolina’s GOP governor has closed a 5-point polling gap with his Democratic rival in the last two weeks, as voters push back against the Democrats’ use of the transgender bathroom controversy to tarnish the governor’s successful economic record.
</span>On Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Gov. Pat McCrory was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 44.2 percent</span>, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 3.6 points</span> behind Attorney General Roy Cooper, according to Real Clear Polling’s average of polling results. Almost three weeks later, on Oct.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 19,</span> McCrory was half a point behind <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 46.3 percent</span>, and climbing fast.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Local GOP officials are eager to credit McCrory’s economic record for the rise.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“As we get down to the final days of the election and voters have to make a decision about who they want to be governor, they are realizing that the governor has been doing his job and getting results while the attorney general hasn’t <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 16 years</span>,” said the governor’s spokesman, Ricky Diaz.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Governor McCrory’s rise in the polls is not surprising when you consider that North Carolina has the fastest growing economy in the nation, people are keeping more of their hard-earned money from the generous tax cuts including those for the middle class and small business owners, and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 300,000 new</span> sustainable jobs have been created over the last four years,” said a statement from Kami Mueller, communications director at the North Carolina Republican Party.
</span>But McCrory is also gaining in the polls because he’s gradually stood up to defend the state’s civic society against the Democrats’ use of the “transgender rights” claim to help their long-term goal of barring government officials from recognizing the biological and social differences between boy and girls, men and women.
Conservatives are rallying to McCrory’s defense of normal society, “as they have the opportunity to hear [him, because] the media has refused to tell the story,” says Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.
“I don’t agree with the concept of redefining gender — that is major societal change, but it is being passed off as a political battle,” McCrory told a group of pastors at an Oct.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7 meeting</span> hosted by the Family Research Council.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve had to do a lot of study on this… I’d never heard of it,” until gay advocates threatened to hammer the state’s economy and to spend millions of campaign dollars against him, unless he rejected the state legislation which affirms the difference between men and women.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Conservatives in the state need to rise up against this gender ideology, despite growing pressure by the media, business groups, Democrats, and transgender-sympathetic friends, he said.
</span>The radicals “have the media on their side, and they have a lot of [public] support because people don’t understand the issue” behind the call for transgender bathrooms, he said. “You’re going to have be direct in informing people about this, because [gay activists and the media] are confusing everybody,” he said.
“The silent majority had got to quit being silent [and] you have four weeks to do it,” he said.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Since <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016,</span> gay advocacy groups have organized a national economic boycott of the state, supposedly to protect the right of transgender people to use the bathrooms they prefer.
</span>However, that push for transgender rights is only part of the opposition to the so-called “HB2” privacy and security law.
The HB2 law preserves routine distinctions between men and women in school and public bathrooms and locker rooms by overriding a city ordinance in Charlotte which said people who are transgender — regardless of appearance, therapy, or biology — can use either the male or female public bathrooms.
The law is a compromise because its says that people who want to use public toilets and locker-rooms in the state must use the facility reserved for their male or female sex — but it also allows transgender people to use the opposite sex’s facilities once they’ve undergone surgery and legally changed the sex on their birth certificate.
Nationally, only about one in <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 2,400 Americans</span> have changed their name from one sex to another, according to a recent study of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 census</span>. Even pro-transgender advocates say that only one in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 160 Americans</span> fit into a very broad definition of “transgender.”
That compromise is anathema to gay activists because it legislatively reinforces what they describe as “the gender binary,” which is academic jargon for the public’s view that society consists of male and female, with only a few mixed-sex people in between.
But gay and feminist activists really want legislators, judges, scientists, and schools to suppress the idea that society consists of just males and females. The activists instead want a society where the government forces Americans to recognize and praise so many types of gender identities and sexual orientations that there just isn’t any normal type of sexual identity. That want that goal because if there’s no normal, there’s no reason for society to favor and praise the normal heterosexual men and women who jointly create each new generation of Americans.
But without the assumption that men and women are normal, distinct, and different, many evolved civic rules would become political battlegrounds in North Carolina and all of the United States.
Single-sex bathrooms and locker-rooms; single-sex sports leagues and women’s shelters; free speech, law enforcement, and social cooperation; science education, parental guidance of children’s sexual development and health — all become new political battlegrounds if government officials treat people’s self-declared “gender identity” as more legally important than their biological sex.
The push to bury the idea of normal sexuality “sends a confusing message to children,” said Perkins.
It is problematic when you starting going into elementary or junior schools telling kids there’s no difference between gender … kids are going through puberty, which is almost like going through re-entry from space — they’re disoriented, they’re confused about a lot of things — and to say that [teenage moods are] permanent, that it is problematic because it prevents the kids from going through the normal stages of life to normal maturity.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Since this summer, gay activists have persuaded numerous business allies and the university presidents who run sports leagues to cancel investments and sports tournaments in North Carolina.</span> McCrory has repeatedly blamed the boycott on his rival, Roy Cooper. “He’s promoting the boycott,” McCrory told the pastors.
Cooper has also received extensive donations from gay activists, including activists in New York, as well as a flood of activists and media support from gay groups.
Also, President Barack Obama and his deputies in the Department of Justice are trying to help Cooper.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In May, he weighed in with threats to cut federal school and transportation funding unless the state’s voters agreed to the federal demand that a person can freely and frequently change their declared sex, regardless of biology.</span> “Transgender men are men — they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women — they live, work and study as women,” Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 9.</span>
In her campaign visits to the state, Clinton also slams McCrory for support of the law that preserves the distinctions between male and female. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In September, according to the Charlotte Business Journal, Clinton told her state supporters that:
HB2 is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn’t have any place in our modern society,” Clinton said during her speech at Johnson C. Smith.</span> “You see this first-hand in North Carolina. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Discrimination is not only wrong, it’s bad for business.</span> The NBA, you know, canceled the (All-Star) game. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">PayPal <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">canceled 400 jobs</span> (in Charlotte).</span> Others are not coming to this beautiful state. Because they don’t want to be associated with the discriminatory, bigoted policies of your governor and legislature.
That pro-transgender pitch is a close match for the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Clinton 2016 campaign</span>, Perkins told Breitbart News. “This ties right into Hillary Clinton and her campaign and the entire left’s disdain for people who believe their faith is something to guide their lives by,” he said. “It goes back to her description [of conservatives] as ‘a basket of deplorables,’” he said.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Polls show that Obama-backed gender ideology is very unpopular — but it is largely overshadowed by the media’s effort to blame McCrory for the economic boycott of the state.
</span>Cooper was also aided by the Justice Department’s decision to launch an investigation of McCrory’s administration. The investigation led nowhere, and was quietly shut down, but it gave Cooper a talking point for the Oct.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18 candidate</span>’s debate. McCrory quickly knocked that claim down, and the federal officials admitted the next day that the previously secret investigation had ended without charges — but the episode allowed the federal Democrats and local media to further hammer McCrory.
McCrory and other GOP officials are now charging Cooper with breaking privacy laws by announcing the secret investigation during the debate.
“Roy Cooper showed the true depths of his ineptitude by his willingness to do or say anything for his own political gain,” said GOP spokeswoman Mueller. “As the state’s top law enforcement officer and attorney, Cooper egregiously broke laws of ethics and rules of the North Carolina State Bar in his drive-by attempt to defame the sitting Governor of North Carolina,” she said.
“Roy Cooper has been an embarrassment as North Carolina’s attorney general for the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 16 years</span>, and his performance in the last debate solidified he would be just as embarrassing and inept if he were to be elected governor,” she added.

BENTON COUNTY, Ark.—When Barb Strickert married, she and her husband wrote down a one-year plan for their lives together. And a three-year plan. Five- and 10-year plans, too.

Their meticulous mapping of the future eventually culminated in The Retirement Plan. Barb would leave the corporate world in her early 60s and run a small bed-and-breakfast on their 11-acre wooded plot in the Ozark Mountains. She and her husband, Brian, would convert the garage into a recording studio to promote local musicians.

The best-laid plans of Barb and Brian have gone awry. One bedroom of the would-be B&B, in their walkout basement, is now occupied by Barb’s 83-year-old mother, and the other by her 34-year-old daughter. Barb has <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 64,</span> and, thanks to her new responsibilities, can no longer afford to quit.

“I was hoping to be retired by the age I’m at now,” she says. “That’s not going to happen. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">I’m going to work until I can’t do the job.”

</span>There is a growing number of baby boomers who find themselves caring for both their elderly parents and their adult children, rather than kicking back at retirement age. They face the strain of constant caregiving and derailed dreams, as well as added expenses. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">It’s one more reason why many Americans are entering their retirement years as unprepared financially as any generation in years.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red""><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2014 study</span> by the Pew Research Center <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 52% of</span> U.S. residents in their 60s—17.4 million people—are financially supporting either a parent or an adult child, up <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 45% in</span><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span></span> Among them, <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1.2 million</span> support both a parent and a child, more than double the number a decade earlier, according to an analysis of the Pew findings and census data.

The squeeze is coming from both ends. With lifespans growing longer, the number of 60-somethings with living parents has more than doubled <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1998,</span> to <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 million</span>, according to an Urban Institute analysis of University of Michigan data, and they are increasingly expensive to care for. At the same time, many boomers are helping their children deal with career or health problems, or are sharing the heavy burden of student loans.

Barb Strickert’s retirement plan fell victim to several bad turns. Her mother, rendered a shut-in by arthritis, didn’t have enough money for assisted-living facilities. Her daughter had to move back home after her own health setbacks.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I can make all of the plans in the world right now and it doesn’t mean anything,” says Barb.

Barb and Brian

Living in Benton County, the birthplace of Walmart Inc., Barb made a career out of helping manufacturers and suppliers service the retail giant.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Now she’s director of category management and business analytics for Cincinnati-based totes Isotoner Corp., which sells gloves, umbrellas and other products.

</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1995,</span> Barb was divorced with two children when a friend invited her to a birthday party at Alibis, a country-and-western dance bar in Rogers, Ark., where Brian was a bouncer. An annoying chicken farmer kept asking her to dance. Brian elbowed him aside, took her hand and led her onto the dance floor.

Six months later, the two eloped. Barb had confessed only days earlier that she <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41,</span><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13 years</span> Brian’s senior. He didn’t mind.

The minister at the small timbered chapel pulled the vestment over the lures hanging from his fishing vest, rolled out a burgundy carpet, set up some fake flowers and declared them married. The next couple in line threw rice on the Strickerts as they headed off to a two-day honeymoon in Branson, Mo.

Barb sang for years at church, while Brian ran the sound equipment during services. Now they attend Saturday night services at Fellowship Bible Church in Rogers, as well as small Bible study sessions every other Tuesday.

The Strickerts are planners. Barb had long envisioned living in a log house in the woods. In the 1980s, she set aside a house design she spotted in Country Living magazine, and after marrying she posted the picture on the fridge. Brian, a heating and air-conditioning technician, re-created the house by hand on the lot by Beaver Lake. After an errant candle burned the house down <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> he built it again.

They began planning retirement when Barb <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 55.</span> The plan evolved over the years, but the gist was that they’d turn <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 3,800</span>-square-foot home into a B&B, plant an organic garden, call it Whispering Pines Farm and Home, and attract the craft-fair and motorcycle-rally crowds.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Brian sold his HVAC business <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 14 weeks</span> in Nashville taking a sound-engineering course.</span> He returned home, bought used high-end microphones and converted the garage into a hobby studio. Early clients include a local resort owner who’s recording a Christmas album and a nephew with a death-metal band.

Marlene

A running Strickert family joke was that Brian and Barb had built a home far too big for a couple of empty-nesters. Barb’s children, Rebecca and Michael, and Brian’s daughter, Krystle, had all moved out.

Brian hadn’t yet finished the studio, however, when Barb’s mother, Marlene Creitz, moved in with them.

Marlene grew up the child of sharecroppers in Dover, Kan., and married Jim Creitz when she was still in high school. Jim had a cherry-red hot rod he had built from a ’32 Ford at <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 19.</span> Marlene used to push-start his first dragster.

They raised Barb, her brother and two sisters in Tulsa, where Marlene worked as an administrator in a doctor’s office.

Many parents of boomers reached retirement age in the mid-1990s, as companies were cutting back on pensions and leaving their retirees to fend for themselves with Social Security and 401(k) plans. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Marlene and Jim never built up a financial cushion.</span> They had a bit of savings and Social Security. Marlene used to pray: “God, please don’t let me get sick <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 65,</span> because we don’t have any money to pay the bill.”

In their retirement, the Creitzes lived in a Holiday Rambler RV, but couldn’t afford gas for road trips. Hoping to make them more comfortable, Barb bought her parents a single-wide mobile home they installed in a Tulsa trailer park. One night <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> Jim set the automatic coffee maker for his morning cup, went to bed and never woke up.

At first, Marlene tried living alone in Tulsa, but Barb and her sisters worried about her safety in a declining neighborhood. The Strickerts moved the trailer to a mobile-home park not far from their house.

Often Marlene just stayed in bed, depressed about Jim and their son Donnie, who had died in his 50s. Getting around was difficult. Marlene has suffered from arthritis since the 1960s and had both hips replaced, one of them twice.

One day she crashed her car into the front deck of her mobile home. A neighbor spotted her trying to crawl up to the back door. Barb and her sisters decided Marlene could no longer live alone.

A yearlong stay with Barb’s sister in Missouri didn’t work out. In <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2015,</span> Marlene moved into Barb’s basement, a suite that now has a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a sitting room.

Marlene’s knees hurt so much that she now can’t move around without a walker. Arthritis in her wrists and shoulders makes it hard for her to play gospel and ragtime on the keyboard in her sitting room. (“She’s kind of a Liberace honky-tonk,” says Brian.)

“I don’t go anywhere,” she says. “I get lonesome. I really do.”

She spends her days in fuzzy moccasins and a cushioned chair, watching Nascar races and the Weather Channel. Throughout the day, Marlene and Barb swap texts with updates on who’s leading the qualifying rounds and who’s getting heavy rain.

Marlene wanted to believe Barb’s house was a waypoint on her return to Tulsa. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">An assisted-living facility there would have <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $3,500 a</span> month.</span> Between her savings and <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">her $1,106 monthly</span> Social Security take-home, her money would have run out <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 3 1</span>/2 years, according to Marlene and Brian. That <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3 1</span>/2 years ago.

Marlene’s arrival was fraught for Barb. No meal was right, no conversation to Marlene’s satisfaction. Finally, Brian snapped Marlene out of her torpor. “These are the facts of life,” he chided her. “You have to straighten up or we’re going to put you in one of those homes you don’t want to be in.”

Marlene couldn’t escape the sense that she was a burden. For years, she insisted on doing Barb and Brian’s laundry. Lately she has been too fragile to take on chores. “You’re doing too much for me,” she would tell Barb.

Barb would counter with a verse memorized from the Book of Timothy: “Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”

“I know that if I want her to stop arguing, I should pull out the Good Book,” says Barb.

Marlene stopped arguing.

Rebecca

Four months after Marlene moved in, in <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2015,</span> Barb’s daughter, Rebecca Wilkins, moved into the other basement bedroom.

Rebecca had moved out years earlier, managing an apartment building for work while kayaking and rappelling for fun, with a snorting laugh that itself made her snort with laughter.

Then, at <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 25,</span> old medical conditions flared up. She had been born with spina bifida and other spinal problems. She started having seizures. Back surgery left her with so much scar tissue that she is now inoperable. She blew two discs in her back.

“Everything kind of collapsed,” Rebecca says. “I went from being a normal person...to completely not functional in life at all.”

She puts her hand to her hip when she gets out of a chair, levering herself to her feet like someone more than twice her age. She can’t kayak any more—it would leave her sobbing in bed with pain.

The physical issues coincide with psychological challenges. She has been diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorders. A couple of rough relationships left Rebecca with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and she remains persecuted by night terrors, she says.

Sometimes putting laundry in the machine constitutes a full day’s achievements.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Her only income <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $700 in</span> monthly disability payments, while Medicaid covers her drug bills and Medicare her doctor’s bills.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Strickerts pay for clothes, housing, food, car insurance and everything else that is beyond Rebecca’s meager income.

</span>Brian is building her a cottage across the circle drive from the main house. Rebecca hopes it will restore a bit of her independence; she worries she won’t be able to clean it herself.

She rarely forgets to tell her parents that she loves them. “If I didn’t have these two amazing people in my life,” Rebecca says, “I’d be homeless.”

Full House

Tending to a sick child would have been one thing. But after adding in an aging parent, the Strickerts had to rework their plan. Barb earned more money than Brian could as an HVAC technician, so she put off retirement indefinitely. Brian would stay home as the day-shift caregiver.

<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 7 each</span> morning, the Strickerts hammer out the day’s schedule on a color-coded shared scheduling app. Medical appointments, pharmacy runs, grocery shopping. Rebecca is orange, Brian is purple, Barb is blue.

Barb gets a month of paid vacation. She and Brian used to spend it hiking in Colorado or Wyoming, or taking in the sun in Florida. Now they spend vacations at home. One of Barb’s sisters takes in Marlene for a month each year, but that doesn’t cover Rebecca.

They’re hoping that one sister will move in for a week or two next year so they can take a road trip to Yosemite and the Pacific Northwest for Barb’s 65th.

“Of all my friends in this age group, I’m the only one who’s still working,” she says. “I have an idea of what I’d like to do, but I don’t feel at liberty to do it right now.”

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Barb has <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1,000</span>-a-month pension from an old job, and the couple has retirement accounts.</span> The money would be enough to retire on if there were just the two of them, they say. But they’re also saving for Rebecca’s long-term care and covering some of Marlene’s daily expenses.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“The only thing that worries me is that my health holds out long enough to generate the income I have to generate,” Barb says.</span> She’s looking into other ways to make money—renting out rooms perhaps, or consulting.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">More than a third of people in their 60s who are caring for parents reported a “moderate-to-high level of financial strain” as a result, a survey by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP found.

</span><span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 18 months</span> ago Barb started to experience growing anxiety. Brian watched her essential tremors worsen, a gentle bobbing of her head.

Six months later, Barb found herself <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sleeping 14 hours</span> a night, sapped of energy and joy. In January, she started to feel tightness in her chest. The cardiologist diagnosed her with stable angina, brought on by a blocked artery and compounded by stress. Angina and cholesterol drugs helped ease her symptoms.

When things get especially tough, she calls in friends from church, a group she calls her “prayer warriors.” At one low point, Barb sought advice from a social worker from a nearby senior center. The social worker warned that she wouldn’t be of much use to her family if she wore herself out.

Barb followed her advice and hired someone to clean and shop. Marlene pays her share. During a mother-daughter visit to the hair salon last month, Barb asked Rebecca to take on light administrative duties—open Barb’s bills, make a few appointments. Rebecca was thrilled at the prospect of regaining a sense of purpose.

In her optimistic moments, Rebecca believes she’ll be independent again someday, perhaps even pain-free. In her darker ones, she fears things will never be the way they were.

“I feel for my parents,” she says. “I know this is not the relationship they wanted with their adult child.”

Marlene hopes for her own quick death, so she’ll no longer be a worry to her family.

“I’m of the age now where I’m looking forward to changing address, stepping over to the heavenly side,” she says, as images of wildfires and floods flicker across the Weather Channel screen.

Barb has let go of any bitterness she may have felt when her own dreams were shelved.

“You have to finally get to the attitude that whatever will be will be,” she says. “You don’t abandon family because something’s inconvenient.”

She and Brian no longer write down their plans.

90855,"<h3>Why Uber Might Stalk an IPO Sooner Rather Than Later</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">A big factor: the likelihood that revenue growth will soon slow significantly, if it hasn’t already

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 2</span>:11 pm ET

Uber Technologies Inc.’s recent sale of its China business <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1 billion</span> while acquiring <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20% of</span> rival Didi Chuxing Technology Co. has been widely hailed as a potential step toward an initial public offering.

</span>That is true. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick has said the company was <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">losing $1 billion</span> a year in China; eliminating those losses makes an IPO more likely.

But it also masks much of Uber’s motivation to go public in the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 18 months</span>. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Here’s another factor: the likelihood that Uber’s revenue growth will soon slow significantly, if it hasn’t already.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Since Uber’s shareholders aim to fetch the highest possible price for the company, it is better for Uber, which remains unprofitable, to go public before its growth slows too much.</span> If Uber times it right, it can make investors in public markets believe it is a good buy—even at a valuation greater than its most <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">recent $68 billion</span>.

“The challenge from an IPO perspective is, Uber is going out at something <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $65 billion</span>, so it’s hard to pitch that as a growth story,” says Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights.

This isn’t just about the law of large numbers. There are reasons to think Uber’s growth has slowed or will soon slow.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">First, Uber may be close to saturating the U.S. market for its primary ride-sharing service.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Market researcher eMarketer predicted in May that the rate of growth in the number of Americans who use a ride-sharing service will shrink <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 7.2% in</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span> from a <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">projected 13.3% in</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017.</span>

</span>Of course, existing riders may use the service more often. But that alone might not be enough to justify Uber’s current valuation.

Uber touts a recent Pew finding <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 15% of</span> Americans have used either Uber or rival Lyft Inc., suggesting both companies have much room to grow. But the same study found that Uber’s core ridership is a narrow slice of the U.S.: young, urban and wealthy, with access to mass transit, taxis, car-sharing services like Zipcar and amenities within walking or biking distance.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The upshot: Uber’s explosive growth to date is effectively the low-hanging fruit of the ride-sharing market, in both revenue and profit.</span> To continue growing at its current pace, Uber will need to penetrate suburbs and second-tier cities. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Residents there are sparser and have fewer complementary transportation options, meaning they won’t yield as much revenue or as many per-capita rides as bigger, denser cities.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Arun Sundararajan, a professor at NYU Leonard N. Stern School of Business who has studied ride sharing, estimates that roughly half of Americans live in areas that aren’t dense enough to support ride sharing.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">At the same time, Uber will face increasing pressure from competitors and its own drivers to shrink its margins in the U.S. “Ride sharing is a commodity business in the long run, so there’s plenty of room for multiple players,” Mr. Sundararajan says.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Conventional wisdom holds that ride sharing is a winner-take-all market.</span> But Uber’s many domestic competitors, and the ease with which it has been copied overseas, suggest the barriers to entry are less about technology and more about access to capital.

A second avenue for Uber to grow is outside the U.S., where the company already is in more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400 cities</span> and <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 72 countries</span>. China is now closed off, but a person familiar with Uber’s plans says that the company is redirecting resources, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 150 engineers</span> who worked exclusively on China, to other markets, including Latin America and Southeast Asia.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The person also said China had accounted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 40% of</span> Uber’s trips, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">but 15% of</span> its revenue.</span> That illustrates a big issue Uber, and others like Facebook Inc., face overseas: Markets outside the developed world are far less lucrative.

In the first six months of this year, Uber said it completed a billion rides, doubling its lifetime total to two billion since <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2009.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">To the extent that growth is mostly outside the U.S., it adds little to revenue and, by the company’s own account, subtracts from profit.

</span>Uber has also talked about arranging for delivery of goods, as well as people. But here, too, Uber doesn’t appear to have any special advantage, and faces big, sophisticated competitors, including Amazon.com Inc.

Then, there is technology. But the company’s much-touted aspirations to replace drivers with self-driving cars will likely bear fruit only for investors willing to wait decades.

Mr. Kalanick has said that Uber will plan an IPO “as late as possible,” but has declined to specify when that might be. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The company is sitting on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $13 billion</span> in cash and available credit and debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s plans.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That means Uber doesn’t need to go public to fund its current business.

</span>But investors, some of whom are board members, helped propel the sale of Uber China to Didi Chuxing. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Those investors understand the logic of taking Uber public before its revenue growth stalls.

</span>It is also important to remember that an IPO is the beginning of a journey, not the end. Consider Facebook, which went public <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 at</span> a then-record valuation <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $104 billion</span>. The early days were ugly; in three months, the shares lost roughly half their value. Today, though, Facebook is valued at more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $350 billion</span>. Uber investors wouldn’t complain about such an outcome.

16068,"<h3>The Federal Reserve chair says inflation will likely remain high in coming months.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Advertisement
The Federal Reserve chair says inflation will likely remain high in coming months.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, is set to tell House lawmakers that inflation has increased “notably” and is poised to remain higher in coming months before moderating — but he will make no indication that the recent jump in prices is pushing central bankers to rush to change policy.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed chair will attribute high inflation numbers to factors tied to the economy’s reopening from the pandemic, based on the text of his prepared remarks.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He will offer no precise estimate for when or how much price pressures will ease.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, starting at noon, will come at a fraught moment politically and economically when it comes to inflation.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Consumer Price Index spiked <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.4 percent</span> in June, the biggest jump <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008 and</span> a larger move than economists had expected.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Price pressures appear to be poised to last longer than policymakers at the White House or Fed had expected.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating,” Mr. Powell is prepared to say.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">He will explain that today’s higher inflation comes from temporary data quirks, rising prices on goods and services facing supply constraints that ought to “partially reverse,” and prices for services that were hard-hit by the pandemic and are now experiencing a demand surge.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">He will also note that longer-run inflation expectations remain under control — which matters because inflation outlooks help to shape the future path for prices.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Expectations “have moved up from their pandemic lows and are in a range that is broadly consistent with the F.O.M.C.’s longer-run inflation goal,” Mr. Powell said, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed chair’s prepared remarks make no indication that the path for policy will change based on the hotter-than-expected price data.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Instead, he will say that labor market conditions are improving but that “there is still a long way to go” and that the Fed’s goal of achieving “substantial further progress” toward its economic goals before taking the first steps toward a more normal policy setting “is still a ways off.”
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fed officials are debating when and how to slow <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their $120 billion</span> of monthly government-backed bond purchases, which would be the first step in moving policy away from an emergency mode.</span> Mr. Powell said those discussions will continue “in coming meetings.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">The central bank is also maintaining its policy interest rate at near-zero, which helps to keep borrowing cheap for consumers and businesses.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Officials have set out a higher standard for lifting rates: They want the economy to return to full employment and inflation to come in on track to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">average 2 percent</span> over time.
</span>Raising rates is not yet up for discussion, officials have said publicly and privately.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said the Fed’s current approach means that “monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.”

10002,"<h3>What it’s like to house-hunt in Silicon Valley, the nation’s priciest market</h3>LOS GATOS, CALIF. — It’s Sunday, which means house-hunting for Barry and Katie Templin. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">They have been on the prowl for months and saving for years, looking for a place with reasonable commutes to their technology jobs and good public schools for their two young children.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">They hope that is not too much to ask, even in Silicon Valley, the nation’s most expensive housing market.
</span>They pull their decade-old SUV up to a house that needs to be torn down yet is offered <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.5 million</span>. “Home has original GE metal kitchen cabinets,” the listing brags. They walk up to find the house unlocked and empty. Black mold crawls over the walls. The ceiling is caving in. The wood floors groan as they pass through.
“It’s like going into a haunted house,” Barry Templin says.
“I can’t believe this <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 1.5,</span>” Katie Templin says.
“It’s because it’s Los Gatos,” explains agent Laura DeFilippo of Alain Pinel Realtors.
The median home value in the San Jose region — which includes the headquarters of Facebook, Apple and Google — has <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached $922,100,</span> five times that of the nation overall <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.5 times</span> the Washington area’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $356,000 median</span>, according to real estate website Zillow.com.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">That’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">also 20 percent</span> higher than nearby San Francisco, the nation’s No.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 market</span> and the usual target of eye-rolling about a tech-fueled, out-of-control housing market.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">But the market is even crazier in the sedate suburbs to the south, in places such as Los Gatos.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The situation in Silicon Valley has long been a full-blown affordability crisis for teachers and construction workers, anyone who draws a paycheck without stock options.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even doctors and lawyers find themselves priced out of popular areas, according to real estate agents.</span> Now, it is becoming harder for tech workers who are willing to spend well <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1 million</span> for what was once a standard-issue suburban home.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">As prices spiral ever higher, there is growing concern about Silicon Valley’s ability to attract and keep its tech talent, especially as the millennial workers who flocked here during the current boom grow up, shed roommates, start families and look for homes of their own.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It’s an increasingly challenging phenomenon,” said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which has found that the region’s company executives cite housing as their biggest impediment to recruitment.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">For people moving to Silicon Valley, home prices often lead to disillusionment, said Eric Boyenga, a real estate agent specializing in the area.</span> Many still feel compelled to move. But not everyone gives in.
Boyenga recalled spending weeks showing homes to a client from North Carolina who had just sold his company to eBay, based in San Jose, and planned to move to Silicon Valley. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">His budget <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $6 million</span>.</span> But he decided after weeks of looking that it was cheaper to stay on the East Coast and fly out a couple of times each month.
“What you get <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $4 million</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5 million</span> here is what you can get <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $350,000 in</span> North Carolina,” Boyenga said.
Barry and Katie Templin moved to Silicon Valley right out of college, more than a decade ago. They rented, then bought a small condo in San Jose, then went back to renting. They got married. They had a son. Wyatt is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 3.</span> Their daughter, Hazel, arrived four months ago. Now, the Templins want a place to put down roots.
They both grew up in the Midwest — he’s from Indiana, she’s from Wisconsin — and their parents back home delight in hearing about the house hunt. To them, it sounds like a tragicomedy. The Templins are up against buyers paying all in cash and willing to waive contingencies. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">And $1 million</span> is the absolute bottom floor. (Anything lower leads to an open-house stampede and a bidding war.)
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“My parents are just horrified by the housing prices,” Barry Templin,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 37,</span> said, laughing.
</span>Katie Templin,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 36,</span> said her father enjoys pointing out that she could buy an entire office building in her hometown of La Crosse, Wis. To make his point, he sent her a listing for a brick, three-story, former bank branch.
“He thinks it’s just absurd,” Katie Templin said.
“But out here, it doesn’t shock people,” Barry Templin said.
They love Silicon Valley. The sun is always shining. The winters are mild. Beaches and mountains are a one-hour drive away. They both work at start-ups. He is vice president of engineering at CardioKinetix, a medical device company working on an implant for heart failure. She is a program manager at AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.
“You can’t beat the opportunities available at tech companies,” she said.
Before crossing the haunted house off their list, the couple visited a property billed as a “Lovely Silicon Valley Farmhouse.” It was farmhouse red, but there was no farm. It sat off a quiet residential street. The kitchen was dated. The den had peculiar wood paneling on the floor and ceiling. But it had three beds <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1,500 square</span> feet of living space <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.25 million</span>.
In Silicon Valley, that’s a deal.
They put it on their list of maybes.
DeFilippo, their agent, used to work as a lawyer. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But two years ago — when she moved from Atlanta to Silicon Valley, in part to be closer to her sister, an Apple executive — she became fascinated by the local real estate market.</span> So she switched careers. Now, she is making more than she ever did as a lawyer.
But that still hasn’t allowed her to afford her own home. As she took the Templins to tour another home, DeFilippo drove by the tiny two-bedroom house she rents <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3,600 a</span> month.
“I’d like to buy, but it’s not in the foreseeable future,” she said.
The Templins’ infant daughter was getting fussy. The day’s last house would be a California Mission-style home <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.4 million</span>. But the front door was locked. The lockbox was empty. The listing agent didn’t answer DeFilippo’s calls. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The seller holds all the power in a hot market like this one.</span> Katie Templin peered into the windows. She wasn’t thrilled by the location.
They decided to keep hunting. DeFilippo was certain that the Templins would eventually find a home to buy.
“They’ll get in here,” she said. “I know they will.”
Weeks later, after several more house-hunting sorties and failing to win a fierce bidding war for <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.3 million</span> fixer-upper, they did. It was <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $1.3 million</span> home.

88571,"<h3>2020 Democrats Address Poverty and Systemic Racism at Presidential Forum</h3>WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Monday defended his approach to working with Republicans, suggesting that those who cannot conceive of compromising with the opposition might as well “start a real, physical revolution.”
“Folks, look, if you start off with the notion there’s nothing you can do, well, might you all go home then, man?” he said. “Or let’s start a real, physical revolution if you’re talking about it. Because we have to be able to change what we’re doing within our system.”
Mr. Biden, who has drawn criticism from some liberals for his efforts to appeal to moderates in a polarized era, also expressed confidence about how he would fare in the South if he wins the Democratic nomination and faces President Trump in the general election. He said that he planned on winning North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and that he believed he could win Florida and Texas as well.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden made his comments at a presidential forum convened by the Poor People’s Campaign, which seeks to draw attention to issues like poverty and systemic racism.</span> It is a revival of the campaign that was planned by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination a half-century ago.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]
Mr. Biden, who leads in early polling of the Democratic presidential race, was one of nine candidates for the nomination who spoke at the forum, held at Trinity Washington University in the nation’s capital. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">He described poverty as “the one thing that can bring this country down.”
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also talked about a revolution, but in a different way: He repeated his call for a “political revolution.”
</span>“Today and in the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 45 years</span>, we heard a whole lot of talk and a whole lot of speeches and a whole lot of party platforms,” Mr. Sanders said. “But you know what goes on? <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Today, the average worker in America is making exactly the same wages that he or she <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">made 45 years</span> ago.”
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The candidates touched on a variety of subjects affecting lower-income people.</span> Mr. Sanders reiterated his call for voting rights for incarcerated people. Senator Kamala Harris of California, a former prosecutor, spoke of changing the cash bail system and providing relief to renters. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts outlined her plan to create a wealth tax and use the proceeds to pay for programs like universal child care.
</span>On the matter of how to deal with likely Republican opposition in the Senate, Ms. Warren struck a notably different tone than Mr. Biden. She repeated her call to get rid of the Senate filibuster if necessary, so that a narrow Democratic majority in that chamber could push through legislation over Republican objections.
“We have to be willing to get in this fight,” Ms. Warren said.
The Poor People’s Campaign is led by the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a civil rights leader from North Carolina, and the Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis, the director of Kairos: The Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary in New York.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The issue of poverty is at the heart of the campaign.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 million</span> people in the United States were in poverty, or <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> of the population, according to the Census Bureau.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">To show the scope of the issue, however, the campaign says that by another measure, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 140 million</span> people can be considered either poor or low-income.
</span>[We’d like to know: What do you want the candidates to talk about at the debates?]
“The word ‘poor’ has basically become a four-letter word for the past half a century,” Dr. Theoharis said in an interview. “If some politicians talk about it, it’s to punish and demonize people who are poor. And many, including many Democrats, refuse to even talk about the poor.”
The candidate forum was an effort to put a spotlight on the subject. “There has to be a narrative shift,” Dr. Barber said in an interview. “If we keep having an anemic, small, limited political debate and discussion, we’re going to keep getting what we’ve always gotten.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before the forum on Monday, the Poor People’s Campaign and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank, released the Poor People’s Moral Budget, a lengthy collection of policy proposals intended to help bring about a “moral economy.”</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The proposals included reducing military spending by nearly half and increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy people, including creating a wealth tax that mirrors what Ms. Warren has proposed.
</span>Organizers of the forum said Mr. Trump was invited to appear but did not respond. The Trump campaign declined to comment."

The first, she said, was anticipated when students returned from winter break after traveling across the country and world. She said the university was able to contain those cases quickly through testing, contact tracing and isolation.
The second spike occurred, she said, after power outages riddled Texas during a storm in February. Students on and off campus went days without power or running water, so some of those who still had electricity invited others to take showers and eat hot meals.
“We encouraged them to help each other — but also reminded them of the best ways to do so as safely as possible,” Ms. Coody-Anders said, adding that it was unfortunate that the outages happened when the positivity rate in the region was high, creating a perfect storm.
She added, “They really did their best — great show of community — but the virus was really rampant at that point, and they were cold.”

The location of a university’s main campus is listed unless otherwise specified. In several instances, colleges noted that some cases were tied to branch campuses or satellite locations.
Thanks to the arrival of the Covid vaccines, many colleges are moving forward with plans for a more normal fall term.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Schools have also hosted vaccine clinics and pushed students and employees to get their shots.</span> The Times has identified more <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 schools</span> — including the University of Pennsylvania, the University of San Diego and the University of Maryland — that have said they will require students to be vaccinated in order to attend in-person classes in the fall. Dozens more, including large public university systems in California and New York, announced that they would require shots if the F.D.A. gave full approval for a vaccine.
Many more colleges have said that only certain students, such as athletes or students who live on campus, must get a shot. Most have said they will allow medical, religious and other exemptions. Some colleges, including the University of Maine and Illinois Wesleyan University, have said they will not require shots while the vaccines have only emergency authorization.
The University of Michigan-Dearborn, which has <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 9,000 students</span>, has decided not to require vaccination. Instead, unvaccinated students will have to submit a negative coronavirus test each week before coming to campus, according to Ken Kettenbeil, a vice chancellor.
Mr. Kettenbeil said the college does not have students living in dorms, and they commute in for classes. But the details of the new requirements are still being worked out.
“One thing we’re still figuring out is how do we record this?” he said. “How do we track it? We’re still working on how we’re going to have people submit proof of vaccination and the negative tests.”
About the data
The college case data is as recent as <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 26,</span><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span> It is based on reports from colleges and government sources and may lag. Cases include those of students, faculty members, staff members and other college workers.
Colleges and government agencies report this data differently, so exercise caution when comparing institutions. Some colleges declined to provide data, provided partial data or did not respond to inquiries. At some institutions, cases may be spread across multiple campuses.
Case totals include confirmed positive cases and probable cases, where available. Colleges occasionally adjust their data downward if new information emerges. Some colleges subtract cases from their tallies once people recover. Some report only those tests performed on campus. Some did not <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">separate 2020 case</span> data <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2021 case</span> data. And some initially provided some data but then stopped. The calculation of percent change from the end <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020 to</span> the present is, in some cases, skewed by the incomplete data colleges have provided.
With no national tracking system, and statewide data available only sporadically, colleges have made their own rules for how to tally infections. While The Times’s survey is believed to be the most comprehensive account available, it is also an undercount. Many universities, hoping to quickly identify cases and prevent broader outbreaks, have aggressively tested for the virus, detecting cases in some instances that might otherwise have been missed.
Among the colleges contacted by The Times, most have published case information online or responded to requests for case numbers. The Times has obtained case data through open records requests at several public universities that would not otherwise provide numbers. Most colleges do not publicly report coronavirus-related deaths.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Times counted reported cases among university students and employees in all fields, including those whose roles as doctors, nurses, pharmacists or medical students put them at higher risk of contracting the virus.</span> Some universities have a broad range of programs, including medical units, and reported dozens of cases tied to health care. Those cases are listed below as a subset of their universitywide totals.
Infections linked to medical schools and teaching hospitals
Some universities did not provide data for cases at their medical schools, hospitals or clinics. Some included those cases in their campuswide counts but did not specify how many there were. Other universities that are primarily focused on medical training, or that reported small numbers of cases tied to clinical programs, are listed in the main table on this page with an asterisk."
2073,"<h3>Trump’s company could save millions if interest rates fall as he demands</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">President Trump stands to save millions of dollars annually in interest on outstanding loans on his hotels and resorts if the Federal Reserve lowers rates as he has been demanding, according to public filings and financial experts.
</span>In the five years before he became president, Trump borrowed more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $360 million</span> via four loans from Deutsche Bank for his hotels in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, as well his 643-room Doral golf resort in South Florida.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The payments on all four properties vary with interest rate changes, according to Trump’s official financial disclosures.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That means he has already benefited from falling interest rates that were spurred in part by a cut the Federal Reserve announced in July, the first in more than a decade — and his payments could drop by millions of dollars more annually if the central bank grants Trump’s wish and further lowers short-term rates, experts said.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It will reduce his borrowing costs quite a bit if he gets what he wants,” said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.</span> Braun said Trump’s savings could be even greater if Deutsche Bank permits his company to pay down the loans more quickly without a penalty, which banks sometimes allow.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">While Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are managing the family business, the president insisted on retaining ownership of his company after his election, bucking the practice of past presidents.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That decision, ethics experts warned, would lead to potential conflicts of interest between his personal interests and public policy goals.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Trump administration has argued that lower interest rates would spur more consumers to buy homes and cars and businesses to invest in new factories.</span> Cutting rates also typically lowers the value of the dollar, making U.S. products cheaper to overseas buyers, a goal of the president.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But most economists and business leaders say Trump’s trade war is the biggest threat to the economy, not interest rates, which are already at historically low levels.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since taking office, Trump has aggressively sought to lower interest rates and rejected the mostly hands-off approach other presidents have taken to the Fed, repeatedly blasting Chair Jerome H. Powell — whom Trump appointed to the post last year — for not falling in line.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">On Friday, after Powell made no announcement of a rate cut and instead voiced concerns about Trump’s trade war with China, the president immediately attacked him on Twitter, writing that “As usual the Fed did NOTHING!”</span> and comparing Powell to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Trump posted.
Trump and his advisers have privately discussed creating a rotation among the Federal Reserve governors that would reduce Powell’s influence, The Washington Post reported this past week.
Asked Friday night by reporters if he wanted Powell to resign, the president responded, “If he did, I wouldn’t stop him.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">[Trump calls the Fed chair an ‘enemy’ after Powell said trade war is ‘turbulent’]
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The central bank’s benchmark rate is one factor in determining interest owed on variable-rate loans, the kind the president has on his properties.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates have also been driven down because of the trade war with China and anxieties about global growth.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Experts said it’s difficult to ascertain exactly how much Trump would save if he gets the reduction in short-term interest rates that he has urged, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2.25 percent</span> <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.25 percent</span> — a move typically reserved for economic emergencies.
</span>But the president would be substantially impacted by a rate cut, they agreed.
Beginning <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span></span> Deutsche Bank provide Trump’s company with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $364 million</span> in loans by working through the bank’s private wealth division, rather than through traditional commercial lending units, according to public loan documents.
The borrowing was for two loans <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $125 million</span> to buy and renovate the Doral golf resort in Florida, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $170 million</span> loan to renovate Washington’s Old Post Office Pavilion into a Trump hotel and <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $69 million</span> loan to refinance an existing Trump hotel in Chicago.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Trump’s financial disclosures and loan records indicate that all four of the loans remain outstanding.</span> His company has paid down at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $19 million</span> of the Chicago loan, according to the filings, though the documents do not show the amount of the remaining balances for any of the properties.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Trump could save at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $600,000 and</span> as much <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $1.1 million</span> annually on just the larger of the two Doral loans if the Fed made a percentage point reduction, depending on the loan agreement, according to Clifford Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland’s business school.
</span>Even a quarter-point reduction, which most Wall Street investors now predict will occur in mid-September, could save Trump as much <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $275,000 annually</span> on that single Doral loan.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">“If you’re a consumer borrower with a car loan or a credit card, a quarter-point reduction is significant savings,” Rossi said.</span> Trump “has more loans and a bigger dollar size, so he would get certainly a larger reduction on the amount owed than most Americans out there.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">An analysis by Bloomberg News found that for every quarter-point reduction, Trump could <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">save $850,000 in</span> annual interest rate payments, which would mean more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $3 million</span> in annual savings if the Fed dropped rates a full percentage point as Trump has demanded.
</span>During his years as a real estate developer, Trump was famous for his aggressive efforts to save money, even when it meant breaking up relationships or shattering professional norms.
Trump has been sued dozens of times for nonpayment of bills, by building contractors, bartenders and even his own lawyers. He used money from a nonprofit charity to pay off legal settlements for his for-profit businesses. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">He once sued his own lender, Deutsche Bank, to get out of a large mortgage.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Before entering politics, Trump often advocated for lower interest rates, which are key for a business that relies on large sums of debt.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Interest rates are very critical to the real estate industry, and [Trump has] spent his whole career there, so he has strong opinions about where interest rates should be,” said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</span> “Every real estate person I’ve ever met in my life has always wanted lower rates in all circumstances, so I think that’s part of [Trump’s] nature.”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">In the 1980s, Trump became one of the most aggressive borrowers in the country, using cheap loans to finance an Atlantic City casino empire that ultimately failed and forced four of his companies to file for bankruptcy.
</span>In the wake of that collapse, Trump was largely frozen out by big banks. He used cash to fund much of his company’s more recent real estate expansion, then turned to an increasingly risk-taking Deutsche Bank for some big loans starting <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span></span> as The Post has previously reported.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">[As the ‘King of Debt,’ Trump borrowed to build his empire.</span> Then he began spending hundreds of millions in cash.]
Democrats in Congress have subpoenaed his Deutsche bank records, but Trump sued to stop the bank from responding and the matter remains mired in court.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Previous presidents have avoided publicly criticizing the Fed to maintain the board’s insulation from politics.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Trump decided otherwise from the get-go and as global economic concerns mounted in recent weeks, he escalated his already routine attacks on Powell, tweeting at different times in July that “the Federal Reserve doesn’t have a clue!”</span> and “They raised rates too soon, too often, & tightened, while others did just the opposite.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Four former Fed chairs, collectively appointed and reappointed by six presidents, then published a Wall Street Journal op-ed urging that the Fed be allowed to act “free of short-term political pressures and, in particular, without the threat of removal or demotion of Fed leaders for political reasons.”
</span>Trump further amped up the pressure Friday after Powell spoke at a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The chair said the U.S. economy was in a “favorable place” but that the trade war Trump launched against China had created a “complex, turbulent” situation.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Trump responded with a tirade on Twitter, blaming China for a boatload of issues and demanding that U.S. companies avoid doing business there.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Stock market investors, already wary of a shaky bond market and declining consumer confidence, began a sell-off that resulted in steep market losses.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Braun, the Northwestern professor, said Trump’s constant pressure on the Fed chair and his colleagues to adjust rates to suit the president’s liking could hurt the U.S. economy.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“I don’t think the Fed should be accommodating Trump’s trade war, and the risk is potential inflation and the reputation of the Fed in the future,” he said.</span>"

This, ladies and gentlemen, if the face of a hero. Coach Aaron Feis was injured protecting a student in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and, at last report, is in critical condition. He is a friend to all students that know him. He was always so nice to me when I went to school there, and I know he is close with my brother and his friends. Please, take a moment to send healing prayers for him.

When did mass shootings become a normal part of American life? There's an entire generation growing up in fear that their school will be next. My thoughts are with families of victims & first responders in FL, but I also know that thoughts are not enough. It's time for action.

A classmate says the suspect showed him photos of his guns:
He’s been a troubled kid and has always had a certain amount of issues going on. He shot guns because he felt it gave him I guess — what’s the word I’m looking for — an exhilarating feeling… He showed me [his guns] personally through his phone and stuff like that I stayed clear of him most of the time during my time in alternate school I didn’t wanna be with him at all because I didn’t wanna cause any conflict with him because that’s the impression he gave off.
5:05 p.m.:
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel says the suspected shooter is was arrested without incident. They are still not sure if all the kids are out.
The Miami Herald reports on the identity of the suspected shooter:
The former student suspected of opening fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland may been identified a potential threat to fellow students in the past, according to one teacher.
The 19-year-old ex-student, who has been detained by Broward police, has not been publicly identified as a suspect. But a law-enforcement source identified him as Nicolas Cruz.
…
“We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,” said math teacher Jim Gard, who said Cruz had been in his class last year. “There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.”

80389,"<h3>Could the tariffs ruin the holidays for shoppers?</h3>“Get out the Ouija board.<span id=""0"" class=""red"">""
That’s how one retail analyst summed up the tricky task of predicting what lies ahead for retailers and shoppers this holiday season.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Analysts say there’s ample reason to expect record-breaking sales on the back of a strong economy, a historically low unemployment rate and upward-ticking wages.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">But that’s all hedged by a hefty unknown: the threat of ongoing tariffs and an escalating trade war.</span> President Trump’s latest round of tariffs have kicked in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 percent</span> and are set to rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 25 percent</span> at the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 6,000 products</span> -- including electronics and other go-to gifts -- will see price increases that, in time, are expected to pass from retailers to consumers.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">And while it’s unlikely that the brunt of those price hikes will take a toll over the next few months, experts agree that the sheer concern over how long the tariffs will last, and to what degree, could act as a Grinch to holiday shoppers.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Business doesn’t manage uncertainty well, nor does the consumer, and there is no way prices don’t get passed through the consumer,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.</span> “The problem I have is, who knows on a day-to-day basis where this is headed?”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The retail industry is still optimistic.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the National Retail Federation announced it is expecting retail sales in November and December to increase <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4.3 and</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.8 percent</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 2017 results</span>, to as much <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $720.89 billion</span>.</span> That forecast compares with an average annual increase <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.9 percent</span> over the past five years. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">(If Labor Day is any indicator, Americans spent a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record $2 billion</span> online then alone.)
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But for comparison, holiday sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 rose</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.3 percent</span> over the year before, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $687.87 billion</span>, according to the NRF.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In mid-September, Deloitte anticipated retail holiday sales to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increase 5 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.6 percent</span> over last year’s shopping season -- totaling at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $1.1 trillion</span> between November and January.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Rod Sides, leader of Deloitte’s U.S. retail and distribution practice, said shoppers are unlikely to make their shopping decisions based on geopolitical issues, such as global trade.
</span>“A lot of it comes down to when they look in their checkbook or their pocket,” Sides said. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“If they have a few extra dollars, whether it be the stock markets to the election to tariffs, it typically doesn’t trickle down.”
</span>[‘This could be catastrophic’: Small businesses say new tariffs will make it even harder to compete]
At the same time, retailers and industry groups have made their opposition to the tariffs clear. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Last month, Walmart sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer cautioning that additional tariffs <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span> of Chinese goods would strike a blow.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Walmart -- the largest retailer in the country -- wrote that the “immediate impact will be to raise prices on consumers and tax American businesses and manufacturers.""</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Target chief executive Brian Cornell said the company was “concerned about anything that would cause higher prices on everyday products for American families.”
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">That’s in concert with arguments from industry groups that say the tariffs will trigger price increases, even if not by this Thanksgiving or Christmas.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Retail Industry Leaders Association, an industry lobbying group, wrote to Lighthizer in September requesting the removal of more <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 650 tariff</span> lines from the proposed list of products subject to the latest wave of tariffs.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Any tariffs on consumer goods proposed by Trump’s administration, the group wrote, are “nothing more than a hidden tax.”
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Larger retailers have long since secured low-priced inventory to get them through the holidays and into the new year.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">But Hun Quach, vice president for international trade at RILA, noted that as the Chinese tariffs drag on, businesses large and small will be forced to restructure their supply chains.</span> Changing the source on products as simple as plastic stickers can take as long as a year, she said.
“The pricing impact won’t hit immediately,"" she said. “I think a lot of this uncertainty is about how long these tariffs are going to be in place.”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">There’s also the question of whether retailers, embracing a strong economy and shoppers with money to spend, could increase prices anyway.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">But Cohen said that, even with signs pointing toward a strong holiday season, “the prospect of raising prices across the board is extremely problematic.</span> There’s no getting away with that.”
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Still, retailers will have to grapple with questions of when to time price increases on goods that will feel the full brunt of the tariffs at the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“Do you start to adjust prices now or do you wait until January?”</span> Cohen said. “That’s a difficult decision.”
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Mark Rosenbaum, department chair and professor of retailing at the University of South Carolina, said that many retailers placed their holiday-season orders over the summer, and that it would be unusual for them to alter the prices now because of the tariffs.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, noted that many of the tariffs apply to goods that have “already been ordered, and have been shipped and are on their way.”</span> The “precise effects of the tariffs are not yet completely clear,"" but any impacts are likely to hit closer to the start <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019.</span></span></span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The tariffs may hit prices for jewelry by Valentine’s Day, for example, but that may be the earliest shoppers will feel a difference.

“Thinking about the ability to spend -- the data shows that we are in a good place,” Kleinhenz said. “The picture looks very good.”

33895,"<h3>China’s Economy Grew 3.9% in the Third Quarter</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">HONG KONG—China’s economy expanded more strongly than expected in the third quarter as the country bounced back modestly from crippling Covid lockdowns in the spring, though challenges remain as leader Xi Jinping consolidates control over the political apparatus for another five years.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">China’s gross domestic product grew <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.9% in</span> the three months ended Sept.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 from</span> a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Monday in a data release that was unexpectedly delayed as Communist Party leaders gathered for a key meeting in Beijing.
</span>The statistics bureau was originally slated to release the closely watched figures on Oct.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18,</span> but they were abruptly postponed a day earlier, citing unspecified “work arrangements” in remarks to The Wall Street Journal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The delay was never explained, though economists widely suspected officials of trying to avoid overshadowing the twice-a-decade conclave.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The economy’s third-quarter performance was an improvement from <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 0.4% year</span>-over-year GDP increase recorded in the second quarter, when lockdowns in major cities like Shanghai shuttered businesses and kept millions stuck at home, sometimes for weeks and even months on end.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the third-quarter number fell short of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.8% growth</span> rate recorded in the first three months of the year, before widespread Covid lockdowns hit the economy.</span> Monday’s figure also put overall growth for the first nine months <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022 at</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.0%,</span> well below the official full-year target of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.5% set</span> in March.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Other economic data, also released belatedly on Monday, underscored the challenges facing the economy.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Export growth continued to slow, a downturn in the housing market got worse and consumer spending decelerated again after a brief summer recovery.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Xi, speaking to the media on Sunday after securing a precedent-breaking third term in power, described China’s economy as highly resilient, with plenty of room to maneuver.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists say the headwinds facing the world’s second-largest economy are intensifying, which will bear down on growth this year and next.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">A property-sector slowdown has hurt construction, crushed consumer confidence and added to financial pressure on overstretched local governments.
</span>Chinese households have also cut back on spending amid the real estate slump and the threat of further restrictions on daily life to smother even tiny Covid-19 outbreaks. Officials have signaled they are unlikely to abandon their zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic anytime soon. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Many economists doubt any significant easing of the growth-sapping policy will occur before the middle of next year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">At the same time, China faces external challenges, with geopolitical tensions rising and overseas demand for its exports fading as the U.S., Europe and other economies confront rocketing inflation and rising interest rates.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for China this year and next, saying it expects the economy to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expand 3.2% in</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span> down from a forecast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.3% in</span> July, and <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 4.4% in</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2023,</span> down <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 4.6%.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Over a longer term, economists say that China is unlikely to recover the rapid pace of growth that it enjoyed over the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 20 years</span>, and it may never surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest economy—as many had predicted it would.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">They cite factors including an aging and shrinking population, a worsening standoff over trade, technology and foreign policy with the U.S. and an enormous pile of public and private debt.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">At the Communist Party congress, top officials said they were prepared to accept slower rates of economic growth to meet broader development goals, such as nurturing high-tech industries and redistributing wealth more evenly—two top priorities that have been frequently articulated by Mr. Xi.
Other data released Monday showed a lopsided domestic recovery, with much of the growth being generated by government-backed production and investments as consumer demand showed little signs of improvement.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Industrial production grew <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6.3% in</span> September from a year earlier, accelerating from <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2% increase</span> in August, as policy stimulus measures kicked in and a power shortage caused by extreme weather during the summer eased.
</span>Growth in fixed-asset investment, including for infrastructure projects, remained steady, expanding <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.9% during</span> the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier, slightly faster <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5.8% gains</span> in the first eight months <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2022.</span>
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">China’s property slump, which was triggered in part by Mr. Xi’s attempts to tamp down on speculation in the sector, showed little sign of reversing in September, as property investment, new construction starts and home prices fell more.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The prolonged slide in Chinese new-home prices accelerated last month.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Prices fell at their steepest level in more than seven years in September, even after officials rolled out more policies to boost the embattled sector and support home buyer demand.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Average new-home prices <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 70 major</span> cities in September <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.3% from</span> a year earlier, after <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">falling 2.1% in</span> August, according to Wall Street Journal calculations based on data released Monday by China’s statistics bureau.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">What is likely to cause more worrying among officials who seek to tilt China’s economy toward consumption, spending appeared to have faltered again as stress on the labor market persisted.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Retail sales, a gauge of consumer spending, rose by a weaker-than-<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 2.5% from</span> a year earlier in September, down from <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5.4% increase</span> in August.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">China’s headline measure of joblessness, the urban surveyed unemployment rate, edged up <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5.5% in</span> September <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.3% for</span> the previous month, the statistics bureau said.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Joblessness among people aged <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 16 to</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24 remained</span> elevated <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 17.9%.</span>
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Separately, data released on Monday by the country’s customs authority provided fresh evidence that the export boom that propelled China’s sharp economic rebound in the early days of the pandemic is likely on its last legs.
</span>Shipments out of China <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 5.7% from</span> a year earlier in September, down from <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 7.1% increase</span> in August, China’s General Administration of Customs said Monday, after also having delayed its data release by more than a week.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">China’s imports increased by an <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">anemic 0.3% in</span> September from a year earlier, on par with August’s figure, partly because of the real-estate downturn, which dampened China’s appetite for raw materials.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">For Jiayuan Toy Products Ltd., a toy maker based in the southern province of Guangdong, sales to the U.S. surged beginning the second half <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020 as</span> China bounced back quickly from the initial pandemic outbreak.</span> In recent months, however, orders have begun to dry up, according to a company manager, who is surnamed Guo.
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">“Western economies suffered this year,” said Mr. Guo, lamenting a drop in orders during the usually booming months of September and October.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Mr. Guo also blamed mounting labor costs and years of strict Covid restrictions that have prevented him from traveling abroad to drum up new business.
</span>“We are just clinging to a few old customers now,” he said.

32600,"<h3>Why Fiat Chrysler’s Talks With Renault Fell Apart</h3>The proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Renault, a tie-up seen as a transformative deal in an industry facing technological challenges, fell apart on Wednesday, and the recriminations started almost immediately.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The stock prices of both companies — which jumped after Fiat announced its plan last week — are feeling the effects.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">In early trading on Thursday, Renault shares were down more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 7 percent</span>; Fiat opened <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 4 percent</span> lower, but then recovered.
</span>All mergers require the balancing of different interests until everyone is more or less satisfied. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But this deal — which would have created the world’s third-largest automaker, with sales and factories all over the globe — stood apart for its varied stakeholders and the influential role of the French government.
</span>In the end, Fiat walked away when the Renault board asked for more time.
Here’s a look at what made this deal so difficult to close.
The French government had its demands.
Renault is often described as a crown jewel of French industry. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The government is under political pressure to save well-paying jobs, and national pride was at stake as it considered a tie-up with an Italian-American organization.
</span>It also had a stake in the deal. The government is Renault’s largest single shareholder, with <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15 percent</span> stake, and has a designated representative on the carmaker’s board.
Fiat’s proposal offered each company’s shareholders equal ownership of the new entity. The French government’s share would have been cut <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 7.5 percent</span>, but it would have kept a representative on the board.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the past week, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, sought reassurances as he met with company executives.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He wanted a corporate headquarters in Paris, and wanted job cuts in the United States and Italy before anyone in France would be affected, one person involved said.
</span>Fiat appeared willing to meet some or most of the government’s demands. But the company’s chairman, John Elkann, was intent on creating a company would not be seen as politically influenced — a perception that had plagued the relationship between Renault and Nissan.
The board met one day this week. Then another. Sometime around midnight on Wednesday, French negotiators “pulled the elastic until it broke,” said one person close to the talks.
Nissan needed more facts.
<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">For 20 years</span>, Renault and the Japanese automaker Nissan had a successful alliance sharing technology and design. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Now automakers are facing disruption because of changing technology, environmental demands, and a fall in global sales.</span> For legacy manufacturers like Renault and Nissan, alliances and mergers are essential.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But the architect of the Renault Nissan Alliance, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in November on charges of financial misconduct.</span> As he awaits trial, the automakers’ leaders — Jean-Dominique Senard, chairman of Renault, and Hiroto Saikawa, chief executive of Nissan — have been treating each other warily.
Initial talks between Renault and Fiat Chrysler were held behind Nissan’s back — the Japanese company said it was informed of the merger offer only hours before the it was formally announced.
On Monday, the eve of the board’s first meeting, Mr. Saikawa issued a statement that seemed like a warning, saying that a Fiat-Renault merger would “require a fundamental review of the existing relationship” to ensure that the Japanese automaker’s interests were protected.
Nissan’s two representatives to the Renault board later said they intended to abstain if a vote were to take place immediately.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Who would lose jobs?
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">French labor unions were expected to have a big influence, and the labor union representative on Renault’s board indicated it, too, would abstain from the vote.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Labor officials have been skeptical of the Fiat proposal, fearing an opening for more layoffs.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Renault has shed at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 22,000 jobs</span> in France <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> the union said.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The French labor union warned last week that stripping the government of its big stake in Renault could give Fiat the power to favor operations in Italy over France.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">President Emmanuel Macron, a former banker whose approval ratings have dropped in the face of the continuing “Yellow Vest” protests over income inequality and job insecurity, cannot afford to be blamed for more joblessness.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">General Electric announced last week that it would <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cut 1,000 jobs</span> in France, stemming from <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2015 merger</span> with the French energy company Alstom, and other foreign companies are cutting thousands of jobs in France.
</span>Could they come back to the table?
“It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,” Fiat said in a statement announcing the withdrawal of the deal.
But could a merger happen? On Thursday, Mr. Saikawa said, “I welcomed the broadening of the alliance’s opportunities, and I still feel that way.”
“Our partner is going to become a different company,” he continued. “It’s necessary to look that over from Nissan’s point of view, so we need some time.”"

The WSJ Dollar Index is an attempt to improve on existing indexes by basing its value on actual, up-to-date turnover by all participants in the foreign-exchange market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The index is proportionally weighted based on foreign-exchange trading volume data from the Bank for International Settlements' triennial central-bank survey on global foreign-exchange market activity.

81433,"<h3>The making of Madison Cawthorn: How falsehoods helped propel the career of a new pro-Trump star of the far right</h3>Madison Cawthorn was a 21-year-old freshman at a conservative Christian college when he spoke at chapel, testifying about his relationship with God. He talked emotionally about the day a car accident left him partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair.
Cawthorn said a close friend had crashed the car in which he was a passenger and fled the scene, leaving him to die “in a fiery tomb.” Cawthorn was “declared dead,” he said in <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 speech</span> at Patrick Henry College. He said he told doctors that he expected to recover and that he would “be at the Naval Academy by Christmas.”
Key parts of Cawthorn’s talk, however, were not true. The friend, Bradley Ledford, who has not previously spoken publicly about the chapel speech, said in an interview that Cawthorn’s account was false and that he pulled Cawthorn from the wreckage. An accident report obtained by The Washington Post said Cawthorn was “incapacitated,” not that he was declared dead. Cawthorn himself said in a lawsuit deposition, first reported by the news outlet AVL Watchdog, that he had been rejected by the Naval Academy before the crash.
Shortly after the speech, Cawthorn dropped out of the college after a single semester of mostly D’s, he said in the deposition, which was taken as part of a court case regarding insurance. Later, more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 former</span> students signed a letter accusing him of being a sexual predator, which Cawthorn has denied.
Yet four years after Cawthorn spoke at the chapel, the portrait he sketched of his life provided the framework for his election in November as the youngest member of the U.S. House at the minimum age <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 years</span> old. A campaign video ad repeated his false claim that the car wreck had derailed his plans to attend the Naval Academy.
He promptly used his newfound fame to push baseless allegations about voting fraud on Twitter in a video <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">viewed 4 million</span> times, which President Donald Trump retweeted, saying, “Thank you Madison!” Then Cawthorn spoke at the Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span></span> where a mob was incited to storm the U.S. Capitol, again alleging fraud and extolling the crowd’s courage in comparison with the “cowards” in Congress. He returned to the Capitol, where he falsely claimed that insurrectionists had been “paid by the Democratic machine.”
Today, less than two months after being sworn in, Cawthorn has emerged as one of the most visible figures among newly arrived publicity-hungry House Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who have promoted baseless assertions and pushed a radicalized ideology that has become a driving force in the GOP.
The story of Cawthorn’s rise is, by any measure, an extraordinary accomplishment at a young age by a man who suffered a horrific injury. But an examination by The Post of how he ascended so quickly shows how even one of the most neophyte elected Republicans is adopting the Trump playbook, making false statements about his background, issuing baseless allegations about voter fraud and demonizing his political opponents.
Cawthorn won his campaign with a brief résumé that included working at a Chick-fil-A, a part-time role in a congressional office, the single semester of college and fledgling work as a real estate investor. He was boosted by a last-<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minute $500,000 blitz</span> by a political action committee that trashed his primary opponent as a “Never Trumper,” which the opponent said was false. Cawthorn’s campaign website said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is Black, wanted to “ruin” White males running for office, an assertion Booker denounced as “rank racism.”
Cawthorn’s election also came despite an extraordinary effort by former classmates and other alumni of Patrick Henry College urging that the voters of North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District reject him on grounds of alleged sexual misconduct. Three women told The Post in on-the-record interviews that they objected to Cawthorn’s behavior, with one saying he tried forcibly to kiss her after she rejected his advance.
Cawthorn declined an interview request. His press secretary, Micah Bock, who went to college with him, declined to respond directly to a list of questions that he had asked The Post to send to the congressman. Instead, Bock said that voters responded to such questions by electing Cawthorn, although some of the events — such as his speech before the storming of the U.S. Capitol — happened after the election.
The young North Carolinian now presents himself as the future of his party, brashly proclaiming that “I will put the Republican establishment on my shoulders and drag them kicking and screaming back to the Constitution.” Cawthorn was a featured speaker Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, attacking “vicious” opponents who are “trying to take away all of our rights” and “are trying to turn this country into a communist ash heap.”
A crash in Florida
By his account, Cawthorn led a charmed life growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina. Handsome and athletic, he was home-schooled and played high school football. He sought admission to the U.S. Naval Academy under a process that enables a local member of Congress to recommend candidates.
That led Cawthorn to seek help from then-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C), a conservative co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus. As it happened, Cawthorn was friends with Meadows’s son, Blake. The senior Meadows agreed in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2013 to</span> nominate Cawthorn to the Naval Academy, but Cawthorn’s acceptance depended on his grades, test scores and other measures.
After the Naval Academy rejected Cawthorn’s application, he said in the deposition, he went on a spring break trip in Florida with his friend Ledford.
During <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2014 trip</span>, Cawthorn, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 18,</span> and Ledford, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 17,</span> traded positions between the driver and passenger seats while the vehicle was moving on the highway, Cawthorn said in his deposition. At the time, Cawthorn said, he thought he was invincible, “didn’t see any danger in it” and did it to save time.
The two were traveling back to North Carolina when Ledford nodded off while driving on <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 4 in</span> Florida and crashed into a concrete construction barrier, Ledford said in a deposition. Ledford said Cawthorn, while wearing a seat belt harness, had been sleeping in a “laid back position” in a manner that the harness did not touch Cawthorn’s body, and with “his feet being on the dash[board].”
Ledford said in his deposition that when the van crashed, he saw Cawthorn was unconscious. The doors were jammed, and the vehicle began to be enveloped in flames. Ledford said he exited through a window, “unbuckled Madison and proceeded to pull him out while a bystander came in and helped me.”
In his chapel address, however, Cawthorn told it this way: “He was my brother, my best friend. And he leaves me in a car to die in a fiery tomb. He runs to safety deep in the woods and just leaves me in a burning car as the flames start to lick my legs and curl up and burn my left side. Fortunately, there was several bystanders who come by and they break the window open that they pulled me out to safety and they sat me down. The paramedics arrive and decided that I’m gone and I have no pulse, I have no breath. And I was, I was declared dead on the scene. For whatever reason, may it be adrenaline or divine intervention, I definitely believe it’s the latter, I had a deep inhale of breath.""
Ledford said in an interview with The Post that he raced to save his friend’s life.
“That statement he made was false,” Ledford said. “It hurt very badly that he would say something as false as that. That is not all what happened. I pulled him out of the car the second that I was able to get out of the car.”
Ledford said the two didn’t talk for a couple of years. He said pressure regarding insurance claims caused Cawthorn to say “crazy things.” Ledford said he has reconnected with Cawthorn, and “he told me that he didn’t believe those things anymore.”
In his deposition, Cawthorn did not say his friend left him for dead. Instead, he said, “I have no memory from the accident.” An accident report and other records from the Florida Highway Patrol say Cawthorn was incapacitated and in critical condition, not that he was declared dead.
As a result of the accident, Cawthorn has limited use of his legs, uses a wheelchair, and received <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3 million</span> settlement from an insurance company, as well as other payments, and is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">seeking $30 million</span> more, according to court records from several lawsuits related to the case.
Cawthorn attributed his poor grades in college to “suffering from a brain injury after the accident definitely — I think it slowed my brain down a little bit,” he said in the deposition. “Made me less intelligent. And the pain also made reading and studying very difficult.”
‘I told him no’
Cawthorn underwent multiple surgeries. Eventually, with a modified car, he was able to drive again, and he soon began asking young women to go on what they say he called “fun drives.”
Katrina Krulikas, who was part of a home-schooling network that included Cawthorn, said she <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 17 years</span> old and he <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 19 when</span> they agreed to go on a date. She said in an interview that she got into his car and he drove to a “deserted part of town and he took me to the woods.”
They got out of the car and Cawthorn talked about sex, which made her feel uncomfortable. “All these very intimate, pressing questions that at the time, for someone that grew up in a very conservative community and hadn’t really talked about sex, I didn’t really know anyone having sex. … It was a very religious community.”
Cawthorn then made his move from his wheelchair, Krulikas said.
“He tries to kiss me and I say no and I don’t let him kiss me,” she said. “We talk for like a little bit longer, like a few minutes. And then suddenly” he moved forward “as if to try to kiss me so quickly that I wouldn’t have a choice to say no or push him away. And at this point, I’m so startled that I fall back. My hair gets stuck in his chair. I’m ripping my hair out, trying to get out of the situation.”
Returning home, Krulikas said she texted a friend that she would never feel comfortable being alone with Cawthorn again. At the time, she didn’t complain because she felt she had “put myself in that situation.” But as she grew older, she said, she believed Cawthorn deserved blame, and “I definitely would classify it as sexual assault because he knew I said no.”
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Krulikas first told of the encounter last August in World Magazine, a publication based in Asheville, N.C., that describes itself as “grounded in facts and biblical truth.”
Cawthorn, whose work experience had mainly been at a Chick-fil-A, got a part-time job working at the district office of then-Rep. Meadows.
</span>Cawthorn told the Asheville Citizen-Times that he had worked “full time” for Meadows <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Congressional records show Cawthorn was listed as a part-time employee <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span></span> was paid <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15,000.</span></span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> he received <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3,000 for</span> part-time work.
Cawthorn said in an earlier deposition he was accepted to Princeton and an online program at Harvard, along with other universities. He later revised his statements to say that he had not been admitted to Princeton and Harvard and that some of his statements about college admissions were “not accurate.”
Cawthorn eventually followed his friend Blake Meadows to become a student at Patrick Henry College, where the motto is “For Christ and Liberty.” In this conservative environment in Purcellville, Va., some female students said Cawthorn asked them to go on drives in his Dodge Challenger.
“He asked me to go on a ‘fun drive,’ ” said one classmate, Leah Petree. When she asked what that meant, Cawthorn “insinuated some sexual activity.” Petree said, “I had a boyfriend so I was I was not going in the car with him. I told him no.”
Nonetheless, Cawthorn continued to “pressure me and badger me.” One day in <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2016,</span> she said, she was in the cafeteria with other students when Cawthorn arrived with some of his friends. Petree said Cawthorn began asking another female student questions about sex that Petree deemed inappropriate, and she tried to defuse the situation.
“He got really angry and looked at me and screamed at me with a lot of anger,” Petree said. She recalled he said she was ""'just a little blond, slutty American girl.’ And I remember that quote very well. … I remember at the time my eyes stinging with tears, the whole table going quiet.”
Petree sent The Post a screenshot of a text conversation she later had with Cawthorn in which he complained that a man approached him and “said I called you a slut.” She texted back that she didn’t know the person’s identity, and he responded that “I have some old friends who would love to meet him.”
Some former students said in interviews that they were advised by classmates not to go on a drive with Cawthorn. But a student named Caitlin Coulter said in an interview that she was not aware of those concerns when Cawthorn asked her to ride with him in that fall semester of<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> She accepted.
Cawthorn took Coulter to “somewhere very rural,” she said.
“There was a specific point in which he grew frustrated and I shut him down, basically — by not responding to some of the advances he was making. And he got upset and he turned the car around and drove very, like, violently is the best way I can think of to describe it. Violently back to campus. It was very scary. … It seemed it was very clearly because he was upset that I had turned him down or refused his advances.”
After hurtling down back roads at speeds she said <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 70 or</span><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 80 miles</span> an hour, they returned to campus and she never heard from him again.
Cawthorn addressed the allegations this way during the campaign: “If I have a daughter, I want her to grow up in a world where people know to explicitly ask before touching her. If I had a son, I want him to be able to grow up in a world where he would not be called a sexual predator for trying to kiss someone.”
It was shortly after Coulter went on the ride with Cawthorn that he testified at chapel about his relationship with God. The semester was over. Cawthorn never returned and did not attend college elsewhere.
Running for Congress
Three years after Cawthorn dropped out of Patrick Henry College, Cawthorn learned Meadows planned to resign his seat to become chief of staff for President Donald Trump. Meadows and his wife, Debra, who was executive director of a political action committee called Women Right, backed their friend, Lynda Bennett, a real estate agent, in the Republican primary.
Cawthorn announced his candidacy. The 24-year-old was given little chance because of his youth and short résumé.
A campaign video ad said Cawthorn had planned to serve in the Navy “with a nomination to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. But all that changed in the spring <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014 when</span> tragedy struck.” His campaign website made a similar statement.
By his own admission, however, that was not true. He had been asked in his deposition whether the rejection by the Naval Academy “was before the accident?”
“It was, sir,” Cawthorn replied. That acknowledgment was not publicly known until after Cawthorn became the Republican nominee.
Bennett seemed the prohibitive favorite, given her backing by Mark and Debra Meadows. But Cawthorn said in a Facebook post in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2020 that</span></span> his campaign was thriving thanks to their son. He thanked “one of my closest friends, Blake Meadows,” for helping with the campaign. Blake Meadows did not respond to a request for comment.
Cawthorn also received crucial help from George Erwin Jr., a former sheriff of Henderson County and former executive director of the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police. Erwin helped the candidate gain endorsements from key law enforcement and political figures. He wrote on Facebook in <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2020 that</span></span> “Congressman Cawthorn just has a sweet sound to it. I will do whatever I need to do to make this happen.”
Then came an extraordinary moment that turned the campaign in Cawthorn’s favor. Someone released an edited audio clip of Bennett saying forcefully, “I’m a Never Trump person. I don’t want Trump. I’m Never Trump, not going to vote for him.”
Bennett promptly denied that she was a Never Trumper, and soon a fuller audio clip was released that seemed to back her assertion that she had been mimicking someone who would never vote for Trump. She led the primary field but state law required that she <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 30 percent</span> of the vote. That led to a runoff between her and the runner-up, Cawthorn.
Bennett again was the favorite. But Cawthorn got an extraordinary boost from an outside group, a Georgia-based political action committee called Protect Freedom that sought to elect candidates in the mold of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) The group’s largest contributor is Jeff Yass, a co-founder of the Pennsylvania-based investment company Susquehanna International Group, who gave the PAC a total <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $8.5 million</span> <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 and</span><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> according to federal election records. Yass declined to comment.
The committee <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">poured $500,000 into</span> the race to support Cawthorn in the days before the runoff. The money was mainly spent on mailers and television ads that renewed the charge that Bennett was a Never Trumper.
Bennett said in an interview that the last-minute spending on what she called a “lie” devastated her campaign, and she ran an ad blaming “Madison Cawthorn’s DC friends.” She said it proved impossible to convince many people that she had been mocking a Never Trumper, even when Trump endorsed her just before the election.
Michael Biundo, a spokesman for Protect Freedom, said in an interview that he believed the committee’s advertising “played a big role in the race.” He said the committee was aware that an audio clip had been released in which Bennett said she was not a Never Trumper but nonetheless decided to air that charge.
“We stand by what we put out there,” he said.
With the committee’s help, Cawthorn beat Bennett <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 31 points</span>. He vowed to be the most pro-Trump member of Congress, and the president soon backed him effusively, saying he’s “a terrific young man. … He’s going to be one of the greats.”
Embraced by Trump
After Cawthorn became the Republican nominee for the 11th District seat, his background was scrutinized by a local news outlet called AVL Watchdog, which first reported on the deposition in which Cawthorn acknowledged that he was rejected by the Naval Academy before the accident.
Cawthorn attacked one of the outlet’s reporters, Tom Fiedler, who previously had been editor in chief of the Miami Herald and dean of Boston University’s College of Communication. Fiedler, who had a home in Asheville, had volunteered for <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> campaign of Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is Black.
Cawthorn responded to Fiedler’s reporting by attacking his association with Booker. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Fiedler “quit his academia job in Boston to work for non-white males, like Cory Booker, who aims to ruin white males running for office,” a Cawthorn campaign website alleged, as first reported by the Bulwark.</span> Booker denounced the comment.
Cawthorn responded by saying, “The syntax of our language was unclear and unfairly implied I was criticizing Cory Booker.”
As Cawthorn headed to the general election, former classmates and other alumni at Patrick Henry College circulated the letter that leveled accusations against him.
“Cawthorn’s time at PHC was marked by gross misconduct towards our female peers, public misrepresentation of his past, disorderly conduct that was against the school’s student honor code, and self-admitted academic failings,” the letter said. “During his brief time at the college, Cawthorn established a reputation for predatory behavior. … We urge the voters of North Carolina to seriously reevaluate Madison Cawthorn’s candidacy in light of who he really is.”
After more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 alumni</span> signed the letter, the organizers hoped it would lead to Cawthorn’s defeat in the general election. He faced Democrat Moe Davis, a former director of the Air Force Judiciary.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Cawthorn, meanwhile, traveled to the Texas border on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 30 and</span>, echoing the views of a radicalized, far-right ideology, alleged that there was “a large group of cartels, kidnapping our American children and then taking them to sell them on a slave market, a sex slave market.”</span> He said that “tens of thousands of our children” were taken in what he called “one of the greatest atrocities I can imagine,” blaming the media for failing to focus on the matter.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">There’s no evidence that cartels have kidnapped large numbers of U.S. children and sold them on a slave market.
</span>The Republican Party, meanwhile, saw Cawthorn as a star and gave him a coveted slot speaking on the third night of its national convention. Seeking to combat questions about his youth, Cawthorn said that if viewers didn’t think young people could change the world, “you don’t know American history.” He said that “my personal favorite, James Madison, was <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 25 years</span> old when he signed the Declaration of Independence.”
In fact, Madison never signed the Declaration of Independence. He was known as the Father of the Constitution, which he signed.
‘It’s time to fight’
Running in a heavily Republican district, Cawthorn won by a 12-point margin against Davis, who said in an interview that his opponent “has got to be the least qualified member of Congress.”
Cawthorn became one of the most loyal defenders of Trump, who claimed falsely that <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> had been stolen from him. In a six-minute video posted to Twitter on Dec.<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> Cawthorn said, “My first act as a member of Congress will be to object to the electoral college certification of <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span>.”
To justify his decision, he repeated a host of false and misleading claims about the election, accusing various state election officials of violating the law even though courts across the country and Trump’s own attorney general, William P. Barr, rejected these allegations.
“Voter fraud is common in America. Those who tell you otherwise are lying,” Cawthorn said in the video.
Cawthorn alleged that a number of states had violated the Constitution and their own laws. Cawthorn said “ballots were shoved into duffel bags and left in parks and gas stations.” He said Nevada “allowed dead people and out-of-state voters to flood the electoral system,” a baseless assertion. He said mail-in ballots “are wildly susceptible to fraud.”
“Fact-check that,” Cawthorn said, adding, “Do not let your vote be canceled by these bastards.”
In fact, voter fraud is rare, mail-in ballots have been almost entirely free of fraud for decades, no widespread fraud was found in the fall election, and courts across the country dismissed more <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 legal</span> challenges filed by the Trump campaign.
Cawthorn’s video, however, made an impression on one person in particular. Trump gleefully retweeted it on Jan.<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> (The Post asked Twitter whether Cawthorn’s tweet met its civic integrity standards. After the inquiry on Feb.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> Twitter attached the following statement to Cawthorn’s tweet: “This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.”)
Cawthorn was sworn in on Jan.<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span> he amped up his rhetoric, tweeting the following day that “the future of this Republic hinges on the actions of a solitary few. … It’s time to fight.” He was invited to speak at the Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 rally</span></span> and derided members of both parties.
“The Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans, hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice,” Cawthorn said, castigating members of his own party who “have no backbone” and deriding “the cowards of Washington, D.C., that I serve with.”
He urged the crowd to be part of a new Republican Party “that will go and fight. … Make your voice heard, because, do we love Donald Trump? But my friends, we’re not just doing this for Donald Trump, we are doing this for the Constitution. Our Constitution was violated.”
Cawthorn then went to the Capitol and, after taking refuge from some of the same people who had listened to his address, called into the Charlie Kirk radio show and made an incendiary, baseless claim that Democrats were behind the insurrection.
“I believe this was agitators strategically placed inside of this group,” Cawthorn said. “You can call them ‘antifa,’ you can call them people paid by the Democratic machine, but to make the Trump campaign, the Trump movement, look bad and to make this look like it was a violent outrage when really the battle is being fought by people like myself and other great patriots who were standing up against the establishment, standing up against this tyranny in our country.” He said the storming of the Capitol was “disgusting, impermissible.”
No evidence has emerged that Democrats or antifa, the anti-fascist protest movement, were behind the insurrection.
Cawthorn was among <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 139 House</span> Republicans who voted to object to the certification of some presidential election results. The Democratic Party of North Carolina’s 11th District, which covers western parts of the state, has called for an investigation into what it calls Cawthorn’s “seditious behavior.”
As the blowback mounted, Cawthorn defended his actions but changed his tone. Asked about his rally speech during an interview on OZY, he said: “If I could go back, I wouldn’t have changed any words that I did say, but I probably would have added some lines. I probably would have encouraged more peace.”
Without any mention of his video baselessly alleging massive voting irregularities, he said that he hadn’t promoted theories about fraudulent voting machines or “U-Hauls being backed up with tons of ballots and they were fraudulently marked. I couldn’t have personally proved that … so I definitely didn’t try and feed into that narrative.”
Erwin, the former sheriff who helped Cawthorn get endorsements, said in an interview that he increasingly is regretful for playing a crucial role in the election.
Erwin went on Facebook after the Capitol riot and wrote: “I apologize to all of my law enforcement friends, other politicians, family and friends — I was wrong, I misled you. When I saw [Cawthorn’s] speech to the crowd in Washington I thought this is not good. … Your words can incite or calm. I saw no calming words and people died and were injured.”
Erwin confirmed that he wrote the post and expressed profound remorse. “I was filled with hope for him,” Erwin said. “And that hope was dashed and it was crushed. And that’s on me. That’s why I had to apologize to folks.”
Republican House leaders, meanwhile, rewarded Cawthorn with assignments that belied his background of a single college semester of mostly D’s and rejection by the Naval Academy. He now serves on the Education Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

83643,"<h3>China Producer Prices Turn Negative in Warning Sign for Global Economy</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">SINGAPORE—Prices charged by Chinese companies at the factory gate recorded their first annual fall in almost two years, another downbeat signal for the global economy as bulging inventories and cautious consumers in the West hit overseas demand for Chinese-made goods.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Chinese producer prices <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.3% in</span> October compared with a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, the country’s first year-over-year decline in producer-price inflation since <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2020.</span>
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The decline reflects weaker prices for the producers of raw materials following a recent pullback in commodity prices, as well as a high base for comparison because of rapid price rises a year earlier.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The data come on the heels of ugly export figures released Monday that showed a surprise drop in Chinese exports to the rest of the world last month.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Taken together, the weakness in the world’s second-largest economy points to a global economy that is losing steam as central banks led by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. ratchet up interest rates to contain rocketing inflation.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Many economists expect a recession in the U.S. within the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 12 months</span>.</span> Europe is already on the brink of a downturn as Russia strangles the region’s gas supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions slapped on it following its invasion of Ukraine.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The drop in producer-price inflation in China comes alongside a monthslong slide in shipping rates, which together should offer a degree of relief on goods-price inflation for consumers in the U.S. and Europe.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">However, central bankers in many advanced economies, the U.S. especially, say that inflationary pressures have broadened to services prices and wages and that further interest-rate rises are needed to bring price growth under control.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“If we see a drop back in goods inflation, that helps address some of the inflation problem, but not all,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1.3% annual</span> decline in producer prices <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">follows 12 months</span> of slowing growth.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a slightly larger decline, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.5%.</span></span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Data showed prices for metals and capital goods fell but prices for some consumer products held steady or rose, albeit marginally.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Consumer-price inflation in China also retreated sharply in October, underscoring feeble spending in the world’s second-largest economy as consumers grapple with the government’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 and a severe property crunch.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Consumer prices <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.1% in</span> October from a year earlier, down from <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.8% gain</span> in September.
</span>That was the weakest reading since May, when Shanghai was in the midst of a two-month lockdown to contain a flare-up of Covid-19. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Economists polled by the Journal had expected <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2.3% annual</span> rise in consumer prices in October.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Inflation in China has so far this year remained below the government’s preferred ceiling of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3%,</span> in contrast with above-target gains in most other countries as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That has given the People’s Bank of China considerable latitude to reduce interest rates and offer banks cheap loans to support growth, though officials are wary of easing too much because of worries over a weak currency and capital fleeing the country.
</span>Chinese health officials said Saturday that China would stick to its tough Covid-prevention strategy, dashing hopes that had built up in recent days for an easing of strict pandemic measures following a closely watched Communist Party congress last month. The number of reported Covid-19 cases in China on Tuesday was the highest since late April, prompting authorities to tighten public-health controls in areas including the southern coastal province of Guangdong.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">With growth slowing in the U.S., Europe and China, economists are downbeat about the global economy’s prospects this year and next.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund warned last month that “the worst is yet to come,” saying it expects global gross domestic product to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expand 3.2% this</span> year, down <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6% in</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021,</span> before slowing <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2.7% in</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2023.</span>
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Economists say China is poised to fall well short of officials’ earlier goal of expanding GDP by <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.5% this</span> year, and instead will likely record its <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worst 12 months</span> for growth—aside from the first year of the pandemic—in decades.

39581,"<h3>Global Deal Making Falls to Slowest Pace in 20 Years</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Global Deal Making Falls to Slowest Pace <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 20 Years</span>
Companies held back by proposed changes to U.S. tax and trade rules, higher valuations
Corporate deal-making has hit a rough patch despite robust stock and bond markets that in the past have led to a deluge of such activity.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mergers and acquisitions this year have slid to their lowest level globally in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 20 years</span> because valuations as well as political and economic uncertainty are making potential buyers wary.
</span>The number of deals world-wide involving publicly traded targets this year fell <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 793 as</span> of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 28,</span> according to Dealogic, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 20% from</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 991 in</span> the comparable period last year and the lowest number <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1998.</span>
Meanwhile, companies are paying higher multiples for acquisitions and investments. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Buyers paid an average <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 12.8 times</span> the target’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization so far this year, up <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 12.1 for</span> the comparable period <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 and</span> the highest year-to-date multiple <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1997.</span></span> The value of deals globally, however, is <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 13.9% year</span> to date <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $479.8 billion</span>. Dealogic figures exclude spinoffs, and include minority investments.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Prospects for overhauls of U.S. corporate tax and trade policy along with concerns about Britian’s plan to leave the European Union are prompting management to hit the pause button on deal activity.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Rising stock prices and deal valuations are adding to their hesitation.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Executives today want more clarity on issues such as tax reform and trade policy, said Robert Profusek, global head of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Jones Day.
</span>They are taking the attitude of “don’t shoot until you have to,” he said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ongoing debates about tax reform, trade policy and corporate regulation have left companies unsure about business prospects, either their own or that of potential targets.
</span>The uncertainty encourages companies to focus only on high-priority deals, for which they are willing to pay top dollar. “This could kill or delay the marginal deals,” said Brian Langenberg, principal at research firm Langenberg & Co.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Last month, medical-supplies maker Becton, Dickinson & Co. said it would buy C.R. Bard Inc. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $24 billion</span>, or more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Ebitda</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 6.4 times</span> sales, according to Dealogic.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Research firm Morningstar Inc., in an analyst note, said the price represented <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 60% premium</span> to its stand-alone valuation of C.R. Bard.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Acquirers typically have paid <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4 and</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 times</span> sales for medical-products companies, according to Morningstar.
</span>“We are confident that the Bard acquisition represents full and fair value for Bard’s high-quality, high-growth prospects and rich margin profile,” Becton Dickinson said. C.R. Bard didn’t respond to a request for comment.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the past, high stock-market levels often have coincided with robust deal activity, as they did <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999 and</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2007.</span></span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But the current slowdown in deal activity comes as the S&<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 has</span> surged.
</span>The index is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 6.5% so</span> far this year, according to FactSet. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Pricey markets can also make it difficult for executives to persuade their boards to approve an acquisition.</span> “When you try to transact at high valuations it’s tough,” said Daniel Wolf, an M&A partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP in New York. “It’s not an opportune time for a CEO to go to the board and say, ‘let’s do this deal.’<span id=""13"" class=""red"">”
The rising deal prices make executives gun-shy too.
</span>“Things are a little bit expensive out there, so we’re being cautious,” said Honeywell International Inc. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk on the company’s first-quarter earnings call on <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 21.</span>
</span>“That’s frankly why maybe we haven’t announced…any deals this year.” <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Mr. Adamczyk made the comments before it was reported that Third Point LLC held a stake in Honeywell and called for the conglomerate to spinoff of its aerospace business.
</span>Industrial gas maker Praxair Inc. has also pulled back. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“You saw this quarter we really didn’t do any acquisitions,” said finance chief Matthew White on the company’s first quarter earnings call last week.</span> “Things are getting expensive.” <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Last year Praxair <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $363 million</span> on acquisitions, including five industrial gas businesses with <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 2015 sales</span> of more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $40 million</span>.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In December, the company and rival Linde AG announced a merger of equals with a combined market value <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $66.6 billion</span> at the time.
</span>In April, Verizon Communications Inc. topped AT&T Inc.’<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $1.6 billion</span> bid for Straight Path Communications Inc. with <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.8 billion</span> offer.
Straight Path owns a swath of wireless spectrum thought to be at the forefront of next generation networks. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The company lost money in its fiscal second quarter when it had revenues <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $200,000.</span></span> Straight Path didn’t return a phone call seeking comment. Verizon and AT&T declined to comment.
Some big serial acquirers may feel less pressure to buy because they have been doing well even without acquisitions. “Organic growth is coming in stronger than expected,” said M orningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini, citing the examples of Honeywell, General Electric Co. and 3M Co.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Honeywell reported first quarter organic sales growth <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2%.</span></span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">GE and 3M reported organic sales growth <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7% and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.6% respectively</span>, and their earnings beat Wall Street expectations
Deal making could soon rebound depending on the fate of some of the new administration’s initiatives, said Mr. Profusek of Jones Day.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“If we did get a tax bill by the end of the year…there will be an avalanche of activity,” he said.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The American economy also remains larger than any in Asia, with the nation’s gross domestic product <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">totaling $20 trillion</span>, compared to the <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately $12 trillion</span> economy of China, the biggest in the east.</span> No city in mainland China cracks the <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">top 10 for</span> containing the most ultrawealthy people.

5383,"<h3>‘It was my job, and I didn’t find him’: Stoneman Douglas resource officer remains haunted by massacre</h3>BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — Scot Peterson had spent much of the past three months in hiding, but now somebody was walking onto his porch and toward the front door. A motion detector activated an alarm inside his duplex. Peterson,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> ducked away from the windows and bent out of sight. His girlfriend, Lydia Rodriguez, walked to the entryway and began to pull down a corner of the white sheet that now covered most of their front door. “Oh please,” she said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“What now?”
It had been <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exactly 90 days</span> since Peterson’s last shift as a school resource officer in Parkland, Fla., where he had been armed and on duty <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 17 people</span> were killed <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 17 more</span> were injured, and ever since then a procession had been making its way to his door to demand accountability for another American mass shooting.</span> First came the Broward County Sheriff’s Office to repossess his police cruiser and his badge. Then came dozens of reporters and television trucks, jamming into the cul-de-sac of a retirement community to broadcast stories about the “Coward of Broward.” Then came a court officer serving Peterson with a lawsuit from a parent whose daughter had been fatally shot on the school’s third floor. “Scot Peterson is a coward,” it read. “Scot Peterson did nothing. Scot Peterson waited and listened to the din of screams of teachers and students, many of who were dead and dying. He let innocent people die.”
“I’m not here,” Peterson said now to Rodriguez as she looked out beyond the sheet and sunlight streamed into their living room.
“It’s okay,” she said, waving at two octogenarians holding a bag of cookies on the porch. “It’s the neighbors. Jim and Kelly.”
Peterson invited them inside and offered them seats in the living room. Christian music played over the speakers and Fox News Channel was muted on television. “Thank God for you two,” Peterson told them. They were two of the only people who had come over after the shooting just to ask if he was okay. As the crowds grew outside his house, they had let him sneak out his back door and through their yard whenever he left to see his lawyer, visit a psychologist, or go for a drive when he couldn’t sleep.
“How are you managing?” Kelly asked.
“I have some okay moments,” he said.
“We’ve been worried,” Jim said. “We’ve been watching the news.”
“Oh yeah? What are they saying?” Peterson asked, even though he had already heard what they were saying and couldn’t stop himself from hearing it, even now. “A disgrace,” the sheriff had said during a news conference. “An awful human being,” one survivor said on national television. “A blight on law enforcement,” said a police union. “A coward,” said President Trump. “When it came time to get in there and do something, he didn’t have the courage.”
Their words ran in a loop through his head, because all this time Peterson had been wondering, too: What more could he possibly have done? Why had he failed to save so many lives in the exact scenario he had spent so much of his career training for — to find and kill an active shooter? He had worked as a sheriff’s deputy <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 32 years</span>, as a school resource officer <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 28,</span> and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for nearly a decade. He was the lone deputy stationed at the school, sworn to serve and protect a community of students who called him “Dep,” honored him with awards, and invited him to proms and football games.
He had been admired and maybe even beloved up until a former student named Nikolas Cruz allegedly arrived at school with an AR-15. And ever since, Peterson had been living inside those next seven minutes. He had briefly considered changing his name or moving out of state, but even if he could somehow outrun infamy and embarrassment, he had decided there was no escape from the questions and doubts that consumed him.
“It’s haunting,” Peterson said now. “I’ve cut that day up a thousand ways with a million different what-if scenarios, but the bottom line is I was there to protect, and I <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 17.</span>”
“Come on, now,” Jim said. “It’s not all on you.”
“But that’s the perception,” Peterson said. “You’re a hero or a coward, and that’s it.”
“People are looking for someone to point to and blame,” Jim said. “They’re just trying to make sense of it.”
“I know,” Peterson said. “So am I.”
***
It was in some ways the simplest kind of crime to solve: committed by one perpetrator who had surrendered and then confessed within an hour. And yet, months later half a dozen inquiries remained underway, each an attempt to derive sense and order from seven chaotic minutes. The FBI was reviewing its threat response. A governor’s commission was examining school security failures. The sheriff’s office was looking into radio malfunctions. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating the sheriff’s office.
Peterson had been doing his own investigating, too, studying dozens of pages of documents inside his duplex. He had rewatched surveillance footage and read witness statements, searching for a way to reconcile the deputy he believed he was with the coward who was maligned each day in the national news.
“How can they keep saying I did nothing?” he asked Rodriguez one morning, looking again through the documents on his kitchen table. “I’m getting on the radio to call in the shooting. I’m locking down the school. I’m clearing kids out of the courtyard. They have the video and the call logs. The evidence is sitting right there.”
“It’s easy to second-guess when you’re in some conference room, spending months thinking about what you would have done,” Rodriguez said.
“There wasn’t even time to think,” Peterson said. “It just happened, and I started reacting.”
He remembered being in his office on the afternoon of Feb.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14 when</span> the first call came in to his school radio, as he was waiting to meet with a parent about a student’s fake driver’s license. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">On most days, that was his job: to police the small stuff — to chase down stolen cellphones, confiscate marijuana, lecture students for vaping in class, and break up the occasional hallway fight.</span> Twice he had caught students with knives, but not once in the past decade had he encountered a gun. Stoneman Douglas was a high-achieving suburban school, with Audis in the student parking lot and packed PTA meetings each month. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The school employed eight security guards to help <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">monitor 13 buildings</span> spread <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 45 acres</span>, but Peterson was the only person who carried a gun.
</span>“If I have to arrest you, then something has gone wrong,” Peterson often told students, because his role was less to be an enforcer of the law than a friendly reminder of it. He had worked before as a corrections guard and as a road officer arriving at the scenes of fatal car crashes and homicides, but it was his work as a school resource officer that had made him one of the most decorated deputies in Parkland.
“Possible firecracker,” came the call in to his school radio at 2:21 p.m., from one of the school’s eight full-time security guards. “Firecracker over by <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>.”
Peterson had dealt with fireworks on campus before, and if there were ever a likely time for one, it was now, during the last class period on Valentine’s Day. “Probably a few kids acting like idiots,” Peterson remembered thinking, and he stood from his desk and walked out to investigate. His office was a few hundred yards from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>, and he was heading in that direction with a security guard when a fire alarm went off. Smoke from the firecracker had probably triggered the alarm, Peterson remembered thinking.
He began running toward <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> until one of the unarmed security guards swung by in a golf cart and offered him a ride. Peterson climbed onto the back and jumped off the cart <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 yards</span> from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>. The security guard drove away, and Peterson took a few steps toward the building before he heard two loud bangs. They didn’t sound like firecrackers. Maybe gunshots, he thought.
He remembered being unsure whether the blasts were coming from outside or inside the building, or if someone was firing shots in the adjacent parking lot or sniping from the roof. He didn’t know, and no one was there to tell him, and he remembered reacting in those first seconds by doing what he believed he had been trained to do: taking cover in a tactical position so he could clear the area. He leaned his back against the wall of an adjacent building. He took out his gun and scanned the surrounding palm trees, the courtyard, the windows, the parking lot and the roof. He waved at students who were walking through the courtyard and told them to clear the area. He reached for his school radio and gave a “Code Red” to lock down the school. He picked up his police radio for the first time just after 2:23 p.m.
“Please advise, we have possible, uh, could be firecrackers. I think we got shots fired. Possible shots fired,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span>,” he said, according to a recording of the radio traffic.
He remembered standing for the next several seconds with his back against the wall, scanning the area around the building for a possible shooter. Trees. Roof. Windows. Courtyard. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. He could see much of campus from his position, but he couldn’t find a shooter. He remembered staying in place because he didn’t want to expose himself when he didn’t know where the shots were coming from. He remembered feeling certain the gunshots were coming from somewhere near or inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>, but where?
“Make sure we get some units over here,” he said into the radio, still at 2:23 p.m. “I need to shut down Stoneman Douglas, the intersection.”
“We’re talking about <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>,” he said, a few seconds later.
“We don’t have any description yet,” he said, at 2:24. “We just hear shots, what appear to be shots fired.”
How often had he envisioned this moment? How much time had he spent studying other mass shootings, imaging himself on scene, wondering how he would react? He had gone to annual conferences about school shootings, taken a class on confronting active shooters and led annual lockdown trainings for teachers. He had started his career as a school resource officer years before <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1999 shooting</span> at Columbine High School in Colorado, back when the idea of a school shooting seemed far-fetched, but now it was a possibility he carried in his mind as he walked around campus each day.
There were always a few students the administration worried about, and three years earlier one had been caught with written plans for how to shoot up the school. Peterson had imagined what he would do if someone started firing in the crowded courtyard during lunch or at halftime of a football game. The ending he imagined was always the same: He identified the shooter. He engaged the shooter. He killed the shooter.
But now he stood against the wall, holding his radio in one hand and his gun in the other. He remembered wondering why he could not locate the shots. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. The fire alarm was still blaring. Police sirens were closing in from all directions. From Peterson’s position, he could see only the east side entrance to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>. Meanwhile, on the west side, at least one victim was already down.
Students inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> were at that very moment <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooding 911 with</span> calls describing the exact location and description of the shooter, but it turned out that those calls were being routed not to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office but instead to the bordering Coral Springs Police Department. Coral Springs officers were not yet on the scene, and even once they arrived, they communicated on a separate radio system from Peterson and the rest of Broward County. The only information being relayed to him was coming out of his Broward County radio, a soundtrack first of silence and then of mounting confusion as the shooting continued into its fourth minute.
“I hear shots fired by the football field!” shouted the second Broward County deputy to arrive. “Shots by the football field.”
“Some thought it was firecrackers. We’re not sure,” said the next deputy on site. “By the football field.”
“We also heard it over by, inside <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span>,” Peterson said, still standing in place. “We are locking down the school right now.”
“I got more students running west toward the football field,” another officer said.
“I hear shots fired,” Peterson said. “Shots — ”
“I have a gunshot victim,” said another deputy. “He is by the entrance to West Glades, on the west side of the school.”
“Does he know where the shooter is?” Peterson shouted, but now it was already six minutes into the massacre, and the last victim had already been shot on the third floor. The gunman was dropping his AR-15 near the stairwell and then heading out of the building, blending in with the crowd of frantic students. The shooting Peterson was supposed to stop was already over.
A Coral Springs SWAT team arrived almost five minutes later to clear the building, and Peterson left his position against the wall and ran to give the team his set of master keys to the classroom doors. He passed by the entrance of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> for the first time, and there in the hall he could see two victims. He still didn’t know whether there were more. He still didn’t know anything about the identity or the location of the shooter. He stayed on the scene for the next several hours, helping to move bodies as the death toll mounted, and later that night he went home to Rodriguez.
She had been sure he was dead the moment she heard the report of “one victim” on the television news. They had talked dozens of time about how he would be the first person through the door to confront a shooter. But instead, here he was, stammering over his words, the grief and self-doubt already beginning as he tried to make sense of <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">why 17 people</span> were dead <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 17 were</span> injured and the only dirt on his uniform was from where his back had been pressed against the wall.
“I couldn’t get him,” he remembered telling Rodriguez that day, before anyone else had begun to assign blame. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It was my job, and I didn’t find him.”
</span>***
In his sleep, he was still looking, still scanning the roof, windows and courtyard, only to awaken each morning to the fresh realization of the same result. He had gone to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist after the shooting, and he had come home with a prescription to help him sleep and a sheet describing the symptoms he had begun to experience: “Confusion.” “Anxiety.” “Guilt.” “Grief.” “Agitation.” “Obsession.”
“Why didn’t I hear more shots?” he said one morning, sifting again through the manila folder as Rodriguez sat nearby. “It doesn’t make sense. I should have heard them, but I didn’t.”
“Relax,” she said, putting her hand on his.
“I only remember hearing two or three,” he said. “I know there were more, but that’s all I heard.”
“Let it be,” she said, even though she knew that wasn’t possible, because she had heard Peterson turn each detail of the shooting into a self-interrogation, a cycle of blame and abdication that could sometimes last all day. Maybe he hadn’t heard more shots because of the fire alarm, or because of his positioning in the courtyard, or because the thick hurricane windows in <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> muffled the sound of gunfire. Or maybe it was the explanation his psychologist had offered, about the ways a traumatic experience could affect cognitive function, compressing memories, narrowing focus, clouding vision and distorting sound.
“If I heard more shots, I might have known where to find him,” Peterson said.
“If I knew where he was, I could have gone in.”
“If I’d gone in . . .” he continued, and Rodriguez squeezed his shoulder before he could finish the thought.
“Let’s get some air,” she said. She moved the sheet and looked outside to make sure nobody was there. Then they leashed the dog and walked out into a retirement development of cul-de-sacs, palm trees and rows of identical duplexes. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Rodriguez had just retired from teaching, and lately she considered it her job to support Peterson and keep him from “sinking too deep down inside his own head,” she said.</span> He hadn’t eaten or slept for two days after the shooting, sick with what he assumed was survivor’s guilt, even though nobody else had begun to publicly question his response.
In those first days, the sheriff’s office had invited him to shake Trump’s hand and be congratulated along with other first responders, but Peterson had chosen to stay home. “Nothing good happened that day,” he remembered telling his supervisor.
He gave his official statement to homicide investigators two days after the massacre, attended two funerals, and used sick days to finish out the first week. He was just preparing to return to work when he got a call from internal affairs eight days after the shooting. The sheriff’s office had reviewed surveillance tapes and watched as Peterson stood against the wall. Sheriff Scott Israel offered him two choices: He could be suspended indefinitely without pay, or he could retire with his full pension, an annual payment of <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100,000.</span>
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Peterson had little money saved, two ex-wives, alimony payments and a mortgage on the duplex he had bought out of foreclosure <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $100 down</span>.</span> He didn’t see it as a choice. He signed his retirement papers, and about an hour later the sheriff called a news conference to release more details about the shooting. The country was demanding an explanation, and for the first time he gave them something or someone to blame.
“One deputy was remiss, dereliction of duty,” Israel said. “And that’s Peterson.”
Rodriguez had tried to cushion all that came next with positivity — with Christian music, prayer and aphorisms framed in every corner of the house. “Rule your mind, or it will rule you,” read one. “Cherish Yourself!” “Create Your Own Happiness!” She had disconnected their TV, booked vacations in the mountains of North Carolina and covertly texted his old friends from the sheriff’s office, nudging them to reach out and call. But on some days, Peterson still seemed unreachable, including now, back on his tablet as he scanned recent headlines.
“Cowardly cop gets princely pension,” read one, and he groaned and flipped along.
“Parkland Parent: ‘Peterson is the lowest form of life.’ ”
“When does it end?” Peterson said, eyes still on the screen.
“Where are you? Come back,” Rodriguez said, but Peterson didn’t seem to hear her. He looked at the tablet, where a little while later he saw a new headline, a breaking news alert. “School shooting in Texas,” it read. “Several dead.”
“Dear God. Not again,” he said, and he turned off the Christian music and flipped on the television in time to see an aerial view of Santa Fe High School surrounded by helicopters, ambulances and police cars. Frantic students ran in every direction. A confused parent stammered through an interview. “My daughter. Where’s my daughter?” she said.
“I really shouldn’t watch this,” Peterson said, his voice beginning to crack, but he kept his eyes on the screen. He watched them load the ambulances. He watched a SWAT team enter the school. He watched as the sheriff held his first news conference, promising “accountability and answers.” He watched as a somber news anchor came on screen to <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">confirm 10 dead</span> and several more wounded, including a school resource officer in critical condition.
“Unlike in Parkland, this time the deputy went in,” the anchor said, and Peterson braced to hear his name.
“A case study in the difference between heroism and cowardice,” the anchor said, and now Peterson was shrinking deeper into the couch and into his head.
He had read that the gunman fired more <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 rounds</span>. Why had he heard only two or three?
“We all remember how in that case the deputy just waited outside, knowing full well . . . ” the anchor began to say, but before he could finish, Peterson reached for the remote and turned it off.
***
It was true that he had never gone into <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> that day, neither during the shooting nor after, and now the closest he could come was by watching a video he had found while looking for information about the shooting on his computer. It was a schematic animation of the crime scene that investigators had made using surveillance footage <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 15 cameras</span> in the school. “A little like Pac-Man,” was how one investigator had described the animation, because <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1200 building</span></span></span></span></span> had been turned into a 3-D architectural sketch, the gunman was represented by a roving black rifle, and the students had become colored dots.
It was a version of a mass shooting with no gunfire, no blood, no screaming, no shattering glass and no hallways obscured by smoke. Here, the chaos had been rendered into something silent and orderly, time-stamped to the one-hundredth of a second. Peterson enlarged the video on his screen and hit play.
“As people are injured, their green dots will become yellow,” the narrator said. “Fatalities will turn gray.”
“Oh, not the dots,” Rodriguez called out from the kitchen, because she had watched the video with Peterson once and thought that was probably enough.
“It helps me if I can see it,” he said. “It clears up my thinking.”
So Peterson watched as the black rifle that represented Cruz entered the building on the first floor at 2:21:23 p.m., and he watched seven seconds later as the first two dots turned gray in the main corridor. <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Within 20 seconds</span>, two more students were dead and four more were injured. <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Within 80 seconds</span>, a total of eight were dead <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 11 injured</span>.
“That first burst of gunfire is probably what triggered the firecracker call on the school radio and then the fire alarm,” Peterson said as he watched dots scatter across the scene. “I’m still running out of my office. I haven’t even gotten over there. What am I supposed to do?”
He watched as the black rifle stopped at four classrooms on the first floor, shooting through doors and windows, circling back to fire more rounds at injured victims as dots turned from green to yellow to gray. A green dot entered the hall from outside and came into the corridor, moving purposefully toward the shooter.
“Oh, God. That’s Chris,” Peterson said, meaning his friend Chris Hixon, one of the school’s security guards who had run into the building despite being unarmed. Peterson wondered whether Hixon, who also was the school’s athletic director, had gone in expecting to find a few kids with firecrackers, or whether he had somehow figured out a shooting was underway. “Was he trying to stop it? Was he hoping to tackle him?” Peterson said, but now he watched as the black rifle turned in Hixon’s direction, and his dot turned yellow as he was hit for the first time. The yellow dot raced behind a wall for cover. The black gun moved closer, taking its time, until it and the yellow dot were side by side.
“A damn monster,” Peterson said, backing away from the screen as Hixon’s dot went from yellow to gray. Eleven dead <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 13 injured</span> in less than two minutes. The black rifle began up the stairs toward the second floor at 2:23:28, about the same time Peterson called in to the police radio to report possible fireworks or gunshots at the school.
“Now I’m finally getting near there,” Peterson said, as he watched the black rifle move methodically through the second floor, finding no victims but firing rounds that traveled through doors and then out windows.
“I was trying to figure it out,” Peterson said again. “I was scanning for the shooter, looking over the windows, the sidewalk, the rooftop. I thought maybe it was a sniper like in Las Vegas. I just didn’t know.”
Peterson watched on screen as the black rifle continued unabated up the stairs to the third floor, arriving on the landing at 2:24:30. The hall was crowded with students evacuating because of the fire alarm. Some would later tell investigators that they didn’t realize an active shooter was in the building. Like Peterson, they had not been able to hear or place the gunshots that were coming from the first floor. Dozens of them sprinted for the stairs as the gunman opened fire, reloading as he traveled up and down the hall, killing six more students and injuring four before he shot his last victim at 2:25:19.
“I was right outside,” Peterson said, pausing the video, rewinding it, sitting again through <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">those<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49 seconds</span></span> when he was standing against a wall and the gunman was shooting on the third floor. On the screen, the shooting appeared clear and the tactical response seemed obvious. Peterson traced his finger over the stairs. “I could have come in over here,” he said. “I could have got him while he was reloading. If I’d just heard more shots, maybe I would have known where they were coming from.”
Maybe then, he said,<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49 seconds</span> would have been enough to do something. Maybe, he said, he would have left the wall and sprinted into the building. Maybe, he said, he would have known to run directly to the third floor, rather than clearing the first two floors. Maybe, he said, he would have located the shooter through the dust and smoke and fleeing students. Maybe, he said, he would have <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">harnessed 20 years</span> of training and steadied his gun on the target. Maybe, he said, his Glock would have proved enough to outgun an AR-15.
“It was all so fast,” he said. “I couldn’t piece it all together.”
“Stop torturing yourself,” Rodriguez said.
“It’s brutal,” he said, but he watched until the last dot turned gray and the black rifle moved down the stairs and out of the school.
***
He didn’t want to answer his phone. He didn’t want to take the sheet off the front door, leave the house or risk being seen, so instead he was back on his tablet one morning when a message arrived from another former school resource officer in Parkland, offering a time to meet for breakfast. “Go,” Rodriguez told Peterson, so he chose a diner in Boca Raton where no one would recognize him. He <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drove 30 minutes</span> and then sat down in a booth across from Frank Wear.
“Convenient spot,” Wear teased.
“I can’t go back into Broward,” Peterson said. “I don’t want to run into anyone. I just — I don’t even know what I would say.”
“No, I get it,” Wear said, because they had been friends for more than a decade. They had gone together to active-shooter trainings and taken a motorcycle trip to celebrate Wear’s retirement <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> Wear knew Peterson as a good cop, thorough and fair. “He had a pulse on everything happening over at Douglas,” Wear said, and that had also included Nikolas Cruz. Peterson had met with Cruz in the fall <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016 and</span> warned him against carrying a backpack decorated with Nazi insignia and racial slurs. He had requested a mental health evaluation after a classmate said that Cruz allegedly drank gasoline. He had even suggested that counselors use Florida’s Baker Act to have Cruz involuntarily committed, but a health expert wrote that Cruz “did not meet criteria for further assessment.” So instead Cruz had left school, and Peterson had gone back to dealing with a dozen other troubled students until a year later, when Cruz suddenly returned.
“The thing I keep coming back to is all those shots,” Peterson said now. “I heard two or three. It’s like my focus narrowed and maybe parts got cloudy.”
“I’ve been there,” Wear said, and he began to tell the story of a time when he had been the first officer to arrive at a scene, back <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span> He had caught two men in the middle of an armed robbery in Deerfield Beach and chased them through the neighborhood by car, eventually ramming his cruiser into their vehicle. The men wore “Scream” masks and carried a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol, and one fired at Wear as he took cover and shot back. He remembered his heart beating in his ears. He remembered the hazy feeling of time passing in slow motion as he killed one assailant and then helped apprehend the other.
“Talk about performing under pressure,” Peterson said. “Your life was on the line.”
“I just reacted,” Wear said.
“Still,” Peterson said. “It was heroic.”
“I feel stupid talking about this,” Wear said. He shifted in his seat and looked down at his coffee. On a television in the far corner of the restaurant, the news replayed images from the school shooting in Texas. An ambulance raced onto the school track. A team of police officers rushed into the building. Peterson sat in silence for a few seconds and moved the eggs around on his plate.
“Look, you were one guy, and you had communications failures, no information, just chaos,” Wear said. “We’re not all Rambo.”
“They keep saying I did nothing,” Peterson said. “A coward.”

President says central banker ‘almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates’
WASHINGTON—President Trump escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying the head of the nation’s central bank threaten U.S. economic growth and appeared to enjoy raising interest rates.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">In an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump acknowledged the independence the Fed has long enjoyed in setting economic policy, while also making clear he was intentionally sending a direct message to Mr. Powell that he wanted lower interest rates.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Powell “almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates.”</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The president declined to elaborate, and a spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment.
</span>Mr. Trump said it was “too early to say, but maybe” he regrets nominating Mr. Powell.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Fed officials have raised their benchmark rate three times this year, most recently in September to a range <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25%,</span> and most officials expect to raise it again at their December meeting.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell has said the Fed wants to raise rates at least to a so-called neutral level that seeks to neither spur nor slow economic growth.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The president’s caustic comments about Mr. Powell came as Mr. Trump repeatedly described the economy in personal terms.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He referred to economic gains during his time in office as “my numbers,” saying, “I have a hot economy going.”</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He described his push for growth as a competition with former President Obama’s record, saying that increases under his Democratic predecessor were skewed because of low-interest rates.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the 30-minute interview in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump also touched on his approach to tariffs, the controversy unfolding over the death of Saudi Arabian dissident Jamal Khashoggi, his eagerness to pass a second tax cut, and his thoughts on his former attorney, Michael Cohen.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Asked an open-ended question about what he viewed as the biggest risks to the economy, Mr. Trump gave a single answer: the Fed.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“To me the Fed is the biggest risk, because I think interest rates are being raised too quickly,” the president said just before he pushed a red button on his desk, summoning an iced cola delivered to him on a silver platter.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said that higher interest rates add to the debt and would act as a drag on economic growth.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He said he preferred to take the savings from lower interest rates to pay down the debt.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“But how do you do that when he keeps raising interest rates on you?”
With the economy expanding solidly, unemployment falling and inflation running at the Fed’<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span>, the Fed has been gradually raising rates to guard against the risk of unsustainable growth, which could show up in the form of higher inflation or financial bubbles.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Asked why he thought Mr. Powell was raising rates, Mr. Trump paused, then said, “He was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy.</span> It’s turned out that he’s not.”
Mr. Trump demurred when asked under what circumstances he’d remove Mr. Powell, who he selected for a four-year term that started in February. “I don’t know,” he said. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“I’m just saying this: I’m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates.”
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">He said the Fed was supposed to be independent “in theory,” but said his instinct was that interest rates are being raised too quickly.
</span>Citing the rate increases, Mr. Trump said, “How the hell do you compete with that? <span id=""18"" class=""red"">And Obama — remember this, it’s very important — Obama had zero interest,” the president said.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The Fed held interest rates at ultralow levels for years after the financial crisis amid anemic growth both in the U.S. and abroad, and began slowly lifting rates in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015.</span>
</span>The law isn’t clear about whether Mr. Trump could dismiss Mr. Powell even if he wanted to do so. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve Act, as amended <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1935,</span> says Fed governors can be removed by the president “for cause.”</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The stipulation applies to the board’s governors, who serve 14-year terms, and not to the Fed chairman, who serves a four-year term concurrent with a 14-year term as governor.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The Fed has enjoyed relative independence in setting policy because it is charged by Congress with making sometimes-unpopular decisions, such as when to raise rates.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Before Mr. Trump, the last president to publicly call for lower interest rates was George H.W. Bush.</span> He blamed Alan Greenspan’s decision not to keep rates lower after the 1990-1991 recession for contributing to his election defeat <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992.</span>
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">White House attacks on the Fed could take on more significance if they’re echoed by congressional lawmakers because the Fed ultimately answers to Capitol Hill.</span> That hasn’t occurred since Mr. Trump took office.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">“I am generally impressed with Chairman Powell’s leadership,” said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in an interview Tuesday.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">He said the Fed’s current interest-rate “trajectory seems to be headed in a good direction.”
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said he views tariffs, which have been a centerpiece of his “America First” economic and trade agenda in his first two years in office, as a negotiating tactic and vastly understated the size of the tariff regime put in place by his administration.
</span>“We don’t even have tariffs. I’m using tariffs to negotiate,” the president said, describing the tariffs on steel and aluminum he imposed this year as “small.”
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.S. this year imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, washers and solar panels, as well as tariffs on an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $250 billion</span> of Chinese imports.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Some businesses have supported the tariffs, but many have said they hurt their profits and could lead to higher prices for customers.
</span>“Where do we have tariffs? <span id=""30"" class=""red"">We don’t have tariffs anywhere,” Mr. Trump said when asked about the risks tariffs pose to the economy.</span> “You know what happens? <span id=""31"" class=""red"">A business that’s doing badly always likes to blame Trump and the tariffs, because it’s a good excuse for some incompetent guy that’s <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">making $25 million</span> a year.”
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">He said the threat of tariffs had helped his administration renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as begin talks for a trade deal with the European Union.</span> “I could never have done it without tariffs,” he said of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised Nafta deal that the three nations reached earlier this month, but which requires approval from Congress.
“I’m talking tariffs, I’ll use tariffs,” he said. “I mean it.”
On Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump said the lawyer who served him for more than a decade was “like a public relations person” who “represented me on very small things.”
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including campaign-finance violations and said Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange payments to two women during the campaign, implicating the president in a federal crime.
</span>Mr. Trump said he was “surprised” when he learned that Mr. Cohen had taped a conversation they had, which was aired by CNN in July. Mr. Trump said the tape of the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2016 conversation</span>—in which he and Mr. Cohen discussed buying the rights to a former Playboy model’s story of having sex with Mr. Trump—was “meaningless.” They ultimately didn’t go through with the purchase.
“It’s unthinkable that a lawyer would tape a client, that a lawyer would make statements,” Mr. Trump said. “He shouldn’t do that. I’m surprised that he did it.”
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump also sought to distance himself from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, which has broadened to examine business dealings by the Trump Organization, according to people familiar with the matter.</span> “Nothing to do with me,” the president said.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">“This was having to do with the taxi industry or something, and financing,” Mr. Trump said.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to evading taxes on income from his taxi-medallion business and other areas.
</span>Mr. Trump added that other tapes Mr. Cohen kept of his conversations—which were seized by prosecutors in an April raid of the former Trump lawyer’s properties—were “unbelievably complimentary to me.”

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico—Rafael Guzmán and Leinaí Romero spent more than four months without power after Hurricane Maria struck last September, relying on a generator to run a refrigerator, two fans and cellphone chargers. When the married couple learned in April they were having a baby, they made a pledge: “We aren’t going through that again.”

They <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">installed 16 solar</span> panels on the roof of their home in Caguas, south of San Juan, and a battery that charges during the day and allows them to run appliances and a TV at night, said Mr. Guzmán, a 29-year-old accountant.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">With a financing plan to cover <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $21,000 price</span> tag, their monthly payment <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $220 is</span> about the same as their average electric bill before the switch.

</span>Residents and businesses in Puerto Rico increasingly are investing in renewable-energy technologies, mainly solar, to guard against power outages from the island’s still-rickety electric grid. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Solar panel and battery makers like Tesla Inc., Sunrun Inc. and Sonnen are pushing into the market.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">As Puerto Rico seeks to wean itself off imported fuels to generate power, it is emerging as a proving ground for renewable energy.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">There has been “exponential growth for the solar and storage industries in Puerto Rico,” said Adam Gentner, Sonnen’s director of business development and Latin American expansion.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The renewable-energy push comes as the U.S. territory’s debt-ridden public power utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, grapples with its future.</span> Last year’s hurricanes devastated the system. All of Prepa’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1.6 million</span> customers lost power after Hurricane Maria, and only last month did the utility announce it had restored power to all of Puerto Rico.

Even before that, the island’s electric grid was vulnerable to disruptions. Its power plants are <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 30 years</span> older than the U.S. average and prone to outages at a rate <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 12 times</span> the national average, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Puerto Rico depends on imported fuels, mainly petroleum, which alone accounted for nearly half of its electricity production in the fiscal year ended <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2017,</span> with natural gas and coal accounting for most of the remainder, according to the EIA.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 2% of</span> the island’s power came from renewable resources, including solar and wind.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Political and business leaders say the island must boost the role of renewable energy, in part to increase the system’s reliability.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In July, Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co., an economic development agency, put out a request for proposals for some of its industrial sites that house large companies like Honeywell International Inc. and Baxter International Inc.</span> It aims to equip the facilities with microgrids—local power systems that can disconnect from the main grid and function autonomously—that include renewable sources.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Homeowners and small- and medium-size businesses are setting up solar systems to supply backup power in the event of an outage.</span> and reduce dependence on the grid. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Since Maria, demand for batteries—which allow customers to store solar-generated power—has soared, said Alejandro Uriarte, chief executive of New Energy Consultants & Contractors LLC, a solar installation company in San Juan.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“We have not sold a single system without batteries after the hurricane,” said Mr. Uriarte, who projects his company will <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach $20 million</span> in sales this year, up <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $11 million</span> last year.</span> Customers include pharmaceutical companies, schools and residences.

F&R Construction Group Inc., a builder in San Juan, had invested <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $150,000 three</span> years ago to install <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 220 solar</span> panels at its headquarters. That reduced the company’s electricity bill to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $4,000 a</span> month <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $6,000,</span> said José García, president of Solaora, an F&R subsidiary that installed the system.

“After Maria we saw how vulnerable the system is,” Mr. García said. This year, F&R decided to invest <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20,000 more</span> in a battery set that can power the company’s computer servers overnight in case of a blackout.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Solar companies say business has increased significantly.</span> Tesla <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 662 projects</span> on the island as of April, including one at a water-pumping station on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. Since the storm, Sonnen has installed three megawatt hours of battery storage in Puerto Rico, compared with about half a megawatt-hour it had set up before.

Sunrun, one of largest residential solar and storage companies in the U.S., initially teamed up with nonprofit organizations after Maria to outfit fire stations in Puerto Rico with solar systems and batteries. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">In June, the company began selling its Brightbox home solar and battery service on the island, and says it has trained <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70 locals</span> for sales, operations and installation positions to help Sunrun meet what it says is strong demand for its products.

</span>Puerto Ricans have “put themselves at the leading edge of the energy transition nationwide,” said Chris Rauscher, Sunrun’s director of public policy.

The Centro de Salud Familiar, a health clinic in Arroyo, on the southern coast, struggled after Maria to keep its emergency room running on a generator. Now, the nonprofit Direct Relief is funding <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $690,000 solar</span> and battery system that will help power the clinic’s EKG machines, X-ray equipment and refrigerators for medicines.

“It gives us mental peace,” said Rosa Rodríguez, the clinic’s executive director.
