63003,"<h3>Tenants Stay Current on Rent, for Now</h3>Since April, landlords have looked to the first of the month fearing that tenants will stop paying their rent. For the most part, that has not happened. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Despite <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 14.7 percent</span> unemployment rate and millions of new jobless claims each week, collections are only slightly below where they were last year, when the economy was booming.
</span>How can this be? The answer is a little negotiation and a lot of government money. <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2 trillion</span> CARES Act, which backstopped household finances with stimulus checks and extended unemployment benefits, has kept a surprising number of tenants current on their monthly balances.</span> At the same time, many landlords have reduced rents or are forgiving overdue payments in full or in part.
The trend cannot continue without a swift and robust recovery, which is becoming increasingly unlikely, or without another big injection of government money, which Senate Republicans say is not happening anytime soon. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">American households were struggling with rent long before the economy went into free fall, and there are signs — from an increase in partial payments to surveys that show many tenants are putting rent on their credit cards and struggling to pay for essentials like food — that this pressure is building.
</span>There are cracks under the surface.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">When the coronavirus outbreak started shutting down the economy in March, there was widespread fear that millions of tenants would fall behind on their monthly bills.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Renters were already struggling with housing costs, with a quarter of tenant households paying more than half their before-tax income on rent and utilities, and the loss of jobs and hours seemed almost certain to worsen those troubles.
</span>Much of the available data has told a different story. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In April, the National Multifamily Housing Council started releasing weekly rent tallies, and aside from a substantial dip in the first week, the rates have been only slightly below where they were last year.</span> Through <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 20,</span> landlords in the council's survey had <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">collected 90.8 percent</span> of rents, compared <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 93 percent</span> a year earlier. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A similar story has played out in state surveys and earnings reports from real estate investment trusts like Mid-America Apartment Company and Equity Residential.
</span>But many of these numbers skew toward higher-end buildings. Other surveys show that buildings with poorer tenants have lower collection rates. Meantime, deferrals and partial payments appear to be increasing: Apartment List, a rental listing service, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">said 31 percent</span> of respondents failed to make the full May payment on time, up from a quarter the month before. Hoping for a swift recovery, many landlords are telling tenants they can pay later, knowing this often won’t happen.
“Landlords and renters will share in the pain,” said John Pawlowski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We just don’t know what the sharing balance will look like.”
New Story, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization that builds and finances affordable housing, recently <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">raised $2 million</span> to help renters struggling to make their bills because of coronavirus-related job losses.</span> Alexandria Lafci, a founder of the organization and its chief operating officer, has spent the last few weeks calling landlords to haggle on behalf of tenants.
“I <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 21 properties</span> and got eight yeses with an average <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 percent</span> off,” she said. Only three landlords rejected any accommodation, with the rest agreeing to arrangements like lower payments for the next three months or shaving down past-due balances to give tenants a break without lowering their advertised rents.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Smaller landlords and affordable housing are in trouble.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Rental housing is a fragmented business, with purveyors ranging from publicly traded corporations that own tens of thousands of units to operators of only one or two.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">And falling rent collections are more likely to affect smaller landlords, who tend to have a limited financial cushion and less capacity to borrow.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">These landlords play an important role in the housing system — especially for lower-income tenants.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Individual investors own about half the supply of low-cost units, and many are what housing advocates call “naturally occurring affordable housing,” or homes and apartments that carry below-market rents even without a subsidy, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.</span> These units, which overwhelmingly consist of small apartment buildings and single-family homes, are also more likely to have tenants affected by the coronavirus, with more than half of renters in the hardest-hit occupations living in single-family homes and duplexes, according to the center.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Naturally occurring affordable housing is often overlooked, but these units are crucial.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Government housing programs like <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Section 8 rental</span> vouchers and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit do not come close to satisfying the demand for lower-cost housing.</span> This is why cities have yearslong lists for vouchers and lotteries for the tiny number of newly built subsidized units.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Getting such housing is laborious and invasive, and it leaves out workers like undocumented immigrants and families whose incomes put them just beyond the threshold to qualify.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Naturally occurring affordable housing is in a sense more valuable, because it represents units that anyone — someone switching jobs or fleeing an abusive spouse, for instance — can find on Craigslist.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">This housing can also be easily lost, not because it disappears, but because it is purchased by a homeowner or investor who renovates in hopes of increasing rents.</span> This is what has happened over the last two decades: <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2014,</span> according to Harvard’s Joint Center, the nation has lost <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2.7 million</span> affordable units, defined as those carrying rents less <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $600.</span>
Carline Chery,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 50,</span> owns three Boston duplexes. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Two-bedroom units go <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1,800,</span> more than what the lowest-income renters can pay but <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $900 less</span> than the typical rent in the metropolitan area, according to Zillow.</span> Compared with a public company, Ms. Chery runs a shoestring operation, with no reserves and little capacity to absorb a missed month.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">So when tenants in one of her buildings recently stopped paying, she borrowed from family members to make the mortgage payment, then put the building up for sale.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The strongest interest has come not from another landlord, but a first-time home buyer.
</span>“I cannot afford it anymore,” Ms. Chery said.
Landlords and tenants both want more money.
Fearing a surge in homelessness, state and local governments spent March and April instituting triage measures, like bans on evictions and utility shutoffs, along with limited subsidies for struggling renters. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The CARES Act also offered aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Since then, tenant activists have unified around a cry of #CancelRent, staging car rallies and roadside protests to demand that the government halt rent and mortgage payments — without the accrual of back payments — as long as the economy is battered by the coronavirus.</span> Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a bill that roughly mirrors that desire.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Although the bill has little chance of passing, housing advocates and landlords’ groups have pressed for more direct help to renters.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The CARES Act <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">allotted $12 billion</span> in housing grants to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states, but the money was largely directed to renters and landlords in public or subsidized housing.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That leaves out most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, and small landlords like Ms. Chery, whose loans are held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The House of Representatives recently passed <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $3 trillion</span> HEROES Act, which in addition to more financial stimulus to households <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">included $100 billion</span> in rental subsidies for tenants affected by coronavirus-related job loss.</span> That bill has no prospect of Senate approval, but landlord and tenant groups continue to push for expanded aid for tenants.
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">“Small landlords and renters depend on each other, and both need emergency assistance to stay afloat during this time,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">“Without it, we will end this crisis having saddled low-income renters with more debt, and having lost more of our country’s critical housing stock.”</span>"
66212,"<h3>Primary Elections Results Live: Latest News from PA, NC, OR, KY, and ID</h3>Latest Developments
Republican Rep. Ted Budd on Tuesday won his party’s nomination for North Carolina’s open seat in the U.S. Senate as voters in five states cast ballots in primary elections that will provide the latest test of former President Donald Trump’s influence within the Republican Party.
Here are some of the key races to watch:
Kentucky (Polls closed <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6 p</span>.m. ET): The Associated Press made some early calls. Incumbents Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie were declared the winners in their GOP primaries.
Pennsylvania (Polls closed <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8 p</span>.m. ET): In the Republican Senate primary, little-funded Kathy Barnette has pulled within reach of two leading contenders, celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormick, who spent tens of millions of dollars. On the Democratic side, John Fetterman is the front-runner but suffered a stroke last week and is now recovering.
North Carolina (Polls closed at 7:30 p.m. ET): Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who has Mr. Trump’s backing, is in a challenging race to stay in Congress after a series of blunders.
Oregon (Polls close <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 p</span>.m. ET): Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the centrist group known as Blue Dog Democrats, is running for an eighth term. His challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, is running to his political left.
Idaho (Polls close <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. ET): The state’s Republican governor is defending his seat against a challenge from the state’s Trump-backed lieutenant governor.
Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has jumped out to an early lead in the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania.
With under a quarter of the vote counted, Mr. Fetterman <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 52.8% of</span> the vote, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 31.7% for</span> U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 11.1% for</span> state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
The race was shaken on Sunday when Mr. Fetterman, said that he was recovering from a stroke that would keep him in the hospital at least through Election Day. His campaign said he cast his vote from the hospital using an emergency absentee ballot on Tuesday, and underwent a procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. The campaign said late Tuesday that it was successful, and Mr. Fetterman was recovering well.
In a closely watched GOP primary, North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn is trailing State Sen. Chuck Edwards but the race remains too close to call. Mr. Cawthorn, whose political future was in peril after he lost support from grassroots groups in his district and many prominent Republican lawmakers, got a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump on Monday.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Cawthorn had made “foolish mistakes, which I don’t believe he’ll make again.” He added: “Let’s give Madison a second chance!”
Mr. Edwards has the backing of the state’s Republican establishment, including Sen. Thom Tillis, as well as many prominent state lawmakers.
With about half of the votes counted in the crowded field, Mr. Edwards <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 36.9%,</span> while Mr. Cawthorn <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 28.8%.</span>
Rep. Ted Budd will become the Republican nominee for Senate in North Carolina, according to an Associated Press projection.
Mr. Budd, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 50,</span> had the backing of former President Trump and Club for Growth in the 11-way primary, which boosted him in the primary that included former Rep. Mark Walker and former Gov. Pat McCrory.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The North Carolina native grew up working on his family's cattle and chicken farm and for their janitorial and landscaping business.</span> He was a businessman before being elected to the House of Representatives <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> He was one <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 147 Republicans</span> who opposed certifying the election results after the Jan.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 riot</span> at the Capitol.
With about a quarter of the total votes counted, Mr. Budd had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 56% of</span> the vote.
In the general election, Mr. Budd will face off against Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. She easily won her primary.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as competitive, though leaning Republican. The winning candidate will fill the seat vacated by Sen. Richard Burr, who is retiring.
Correction: Ted Budd won the GOP Senate primary in North Carolina. The initial headline incorrectly said he won the GOP governor primary.
Polls are starting close, and the Associated Press made some early calls in races with little competition. Kentucky incumbent Sen. Rand Paul was declared the winner in his GOP primary. With <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% of</span> votes counted, he led with <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 86% of</span> the vote.
Next up in races to watch: Polls close at 7:30 in North Carolina <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 8 p</span>.m. in Pennsylvania.
Polls close in Idaho <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 p</span></span>.m. ET.
Republican Gov. Brad Little is facing off against his lieutenant governor, fellow Republican Janice McGeachin, in an unusually bitter intraparty battle.
Mr. Little is one of several mainstream conservative Republicans in Idaho who are facing challenges from the right-wing faction of the party in this solidly conservative state. Whoever wins the GOP primary is expected to easily win the governor’s seat in November.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">At stake is the future direction of the Idaho Republican Party, which has been riven by divisions between those who support former president Donald Trump and those with more traditionally conservative views on social and fiscal issues.
</span>It will also provide a test of the power of an endorsement from Mr. Trump, who is backing Ms. McGeachin over the incumbent.
A poll published last month by the Idaho Dispatch showed Mr. Little with the support <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 60% of</span> likely GOP primary voters, compared <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 29% for</span> Ms. McGeachin.
Mr. Little and Ms. McGeachin have clashed publicly since he was elected <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018.</span> She used her temporary powers as acting governor when he was out-of-state to issue executive orders that barred local governments from applying Covid-19 mask and vaccine mandates. Mr. Little reversed those orders upon his return.
Ms. McGeachin campaigned on promises to prohibit the “medical tyranny” of vaccine requirements and has urged state legislators to remove exceptions for reasons such as rape, incest and the mother’s health from the state’s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which Mr. Little signed in March. Last month, Idaho Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law as legal challenges continue.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Mr. Little touted the fact that he has presided over record budget surpluses, cut taxes, and increased funding for schools.
</span>The Senate campaign of Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he underwent a procedure Tuesday to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. The campaign said Mr. Fetterman ""has been given the all-clear that it was successful"" and he was recovering well.
Earlier, his campaign released a photo of Mr. Fetterman casting his vote from Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital using an emergency absentee ballot.
Mr. Fetterman’s wife had urged him to go to the hospital on Friday after he wasn’t feeling well, according to a statement released Sunday. He said that his stroke was caused by a clot stemming from atrial fibrillation, or afib, an irregular or often rapid heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications.
Democrats in Oregon’s new 6th Congressional District will choose their nominee from a packed field that has seen more <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $13 million</span> in outside spending.
More <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $12 million</span> has been spent in support of first time candidate Carrick Flynn, who most recently advised the government on pandemic response. Most of that money,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10 million</span>, has come from a PAC backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old billionaire who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The group’s association with Mr. Bankman-Fried was first reported by Politico.
The PAC aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) also spent <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $1 million</span> to boost Mr. Flynn, arguing he was the strongest candidate in a general election.
The heavy spending has caused frustration with some Democrats who believe state Rep. Andrea Salinas is better qualified and more representative of what the Democratic party stands for. The state’s Democratic governor has endorsed Ms. Salinas.
More <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.5 million</span> has been spent on behalf of Ms. Salinas, <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $1 million</span> from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Bold PAC. The group said Ms. Salinas was qualified and would make history as Oregon’s first Hispanic representative.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The district is rated “lean Democratic” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, but Republicans say they have a chance given President Biden’s low approval ratings, record high inflation and historical trends that benefit the out-of-power party.
</span>A handful of Republican voters in the former steel town of Aliquippa, Pa., said that former President Donald Trump’s endorsements in the Senate and gubernatorial races played a major role in helping them choose which candidate to back in crowded fields.
In the governor’s race, Jon Keirs,<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 36,</span> who voted at the St. George Byzantine Catholic Church in Aliquippa, said Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Mastriano, along with critical words the former president had for another candidate, pushed him to back Mr. Mastriano.
Mr. Keirs, who described himself as a stay-at-home-dad, said that listening to a video of Mr. Mastriano outlining his policies sealed his decision.
At the same time, Mr. Keirs said he wasn’t swayed by state GOP leaders who said Mr. Mastriano is too far right to beat Democrat Josh Shapiro in November.
“They say he’s the least electable, but I’m not sure I buy that,” Mr. Keirs said. “I get the argument that he’s so MAGA and right-wing that he’s unelectable. I think a lot of Pennsylvanian voters like that. Not because it’s radical but because it hits the values closest to home.”
In the Senate race, Mr. Keirs said he ultimately chose Republican Dave McCormick over Mehmet Oz, Mr. Trump’s chosen candidate. In this case, Mr. Keirs said the former president’s endorsement was blunted by that of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others who backed Mr. McCormick.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Do I think the celebrity is going to bring positive cultural change, or do I think the business guy is going to bring positive economic change?”</span> Mr. Keirs said. “I kind of felt that McCormick would do better in the long run.”
Meanwhile, several Democrats said they voted for Rep. Conor Lamb in the Democratic primary, saying they were drawn to his more moderate policies and demeanor compared to rival John Fetterman.
“He’s moderate and has the best chance of winning the state,” Olga Bobish,<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 73,</span> a retired teacher, said of Mr. Lamb. At the same time, she said she would support Mr. Fetterman if he won. “I will volunteer for him,” she said. “Maybe not as passionately as for Conor Lamb.”
Polls close in North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. ET. Here are some races to watch.
Trump's Power in the Senate
Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd is in an 11-way GOP primary that includes former Rep. Mark Walker and former Gov. Pat McCrory. The race will be part of the ongoing test of the power of former President Trump's endorsement in primary contests. The candidates are vying to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Richard Burr. The nonpartisan Cook Political report rates the seat as leaning Republican.
This is likely to give Mr. Trump’s track record a boost early on in the night. A poll this month by Emerson College showed Mr. Budd <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 43% support</span>, Mr. McCrory <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 16% and</span> Walker <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 12%.</span>
Can Madison Cawthorn Fight off Challengers?
Voters in Western North Carolina will decide whether to follow Mr. Trump's advice and give freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn a second chance or not. The gaffe-plagued congressman is battling to win an eight-way primary that became crowded when he sought to change districts.
Strategists are watching the number of unaffiliated voters that vote in the primary. It could be Democrats from Asheville weighing in on the primary, trying to vote against Mr. Cawthorn for a more establishment-type Republican in the deep-red district. State Sen. Chuck Edwards is the candidate backed by Sen. Thom Tillis and other legislators. Mr. Cawthorn <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needs 30% plus</span> one vote to avoid a runoff in July.
""If there's a runoff, Cawthorn loses,"" Mr. Tillis told reporters on Tuesday.
Another test for Trump in North Carolina's open district
If Mr. Trump's endorsements hold firm, Mr. Cawthorn could be joined by another 26-year-old in Congress. Former college football player Bo Hines is running in a crowded primary and two conservative groups -- the Club for Growth and a super PAC aligned with the House Freedom Caucus – have spent more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $2 million</span> to help him.
He faces seven other candidates. They include attorney Kelly Daughtry, who has put millions of her own money in the race, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers, who may have some name recognition in the area from her time representing part of the district <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 to</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017.</span>
When Summer Lee ran for re-election to the state House two years ago, her county’s Democratic Party committee endorsed her primary election opponent. It was a rare step, given that party organizations tend to favor incumbents, and a sign that Ms. Lee’s progressive views were in conflict with those of local Democratic leaders.
Today, Ms. Lee is running for a U.S. House seat in the Pittsburgh area, facing lawyer Steve Irwin and others in the Democratic primary. Once again, she has become a flag-bearer in the campaign by the Democrats’ liberal wing to overtake the party’s centrists.
The race, to replace retiring Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat, is one of several on Tuesday that will signal whether Democratic voters are willing to take a left turn. Others include House races in Oregon and North Carolina.
Ms. Lee, who local officials say would be the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress, has endorsements from members of the “squad’’ -- the most liberal members of the House -- including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party and other liberal groups have backed her, as well.
Absent from her endorsement list once again is the Allegheny County Democratic Committee.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The party committee is backing Mr. Irwin, who is pushing for such Democratic priorities as <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $15 minimum</span> wage and universal background checks for gun purchases.</span> But on Medicare and climate change, among other issues, his approach is more incremental than that of Ms. Lee, who supports Medicare for all and has opposed some new fracking wells to extract natural gas.
Mr. Doyle is backing Mr. Irwin to be his successor in the House, and other prominent officials, including former Gov. Ed Rendell, are backing Mr. Irwin, as well."
19687,"<h3>The Dangers of Hiring for Cultural Fit</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Dangers of Hiring for Cultural Fit
Employers often aim to hire people they think will be a good fit, but their efforts can easily veer into a ditch where new hires all look, think and act alike
What happens when a boss tries to foster a more inviting workplace, but not everyone feels invited?
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Employers often aim to hire people they think will be a good “cultural fit,” with attributes that will mesh with a company’s goals and values.</span> But their efforts can easily veer into a ditch where new hires all look, think and act alike. That’s bad for anyone who cares about an office with a mix of races, genders and points of view.
“What most people mean by culture fit is hiring people they’d like to have a beer with,” says Patty McCord, a human-resources consultant and former chief talent officer at Netflix. “You end up with this big, homogenous culture where everybody looks alike, everybody thinks alike, and everybody likes drinking beer <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 o</span>’clock in the afternoon with the bros,” she says.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">An alluring culture is a coveted prize in today’s tight labor market, surging to first from fifth place in the last five years as the most important factor in recruiting top talent, according to <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2018 Korn</span> Ferry survey <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1,100 hiring</span> managers.</span> But there’s a difference between cultural frills like office ping pong and craft beer, and deeper ones that mean more. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">To employees, it means loving a job for more than just the paycheck.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And to employers, it means employees will keep working hard even when no one is watching.
</span>Making a good match can be difficult. In a pattern researchers call looking-glass merit, hirers tend to look for traits in candidates that make them feel good about themselves. These may be more nuanced than race or gender. A manager who got bad grades as a college freshman is likely to warm to an applicant who also got off to a rough start, research shows. Or a hirer who attended a low-prestige school may favor applicants who did the same.
“What most interviewers are looking for and acting on is more of an intuitive sense of, ‘Would I get along with this person?’ and that often isn’t very reliable,” says Kirsta Anderson, global head of culture transformation in London for Korn Ferry.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Employees err in taking a job because it offers office ping pong, free lunches or heated toilet seats.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ms. McCord recently met an HR executive who claimed to keep employees happy by serving up the latest craft beers.</span> “Well, that sounds like a fun vacation. I’d probably go to that resort. But that’s not what you’re here to do,” says Ms. McCord, author of “Powerful,” a book on building workplace cultures.
Share Your Thoughts
How can bosses make sure they’re hiring for meaningful shared values rather than superficial sameness? Join the conversation below.
Hiring managers need to go deeper and figure out whether applicants are in sync with more fundamental elements of their culture, Ms. Anderson says. Are they excited about how the company innovates, serves customers or makes a social impact? Will they mesh with the way individuals and teams at the company work, by collaborating or competing? <span id=""7"" class=""red"">And will they naturally make decisions the way the employer wants—individually or as a group, embracing or avoiding risk?
</span>It isn’t easy to suss out those traits in an interview. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Jeanne Leasure, a human-resources executive, recalls interviewing applicants for a job that gave employees a lot of autonomy.</span> She was looking for recruits who were self-starters, but wound up hiring one who turned out to be a lovable slacker. “We hit it off, we had similar personalities,” and the applicant gave convincing answers when she asked him about past accomplishments, she says. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But on the job, he didn’t have as much drive as she’d hoped, says Ms. Leasure, who was recently named senior vice president, people, at SpotX, an ad-tech company based in Broomfield, Colo.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She has begun asking more probing questions, such as, “What was your work ethic like as a teenager?”
Fingerpaint Marketing is a flat organization with no lofty job titles, and its teams must work smoothly together on tight deadlines.</span> When Ed Mitzen, founder of the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., agency, interviews candidates, he explores whether they’ll be kind to everyone regardless of status, and pleasant to work with. If teammates enjoy working with them, he reasons the team will get more done and do better work.
He screens out big egos partly by asking drivers for his company’s car service how candidates treated them en route to and from the interview. “If they’re a jerk to the car-service guy, that’s a warning sign,” Mr. Mitzen says.

Defining Cultural Fit
What it is:
—Shared enthusiasm about a company’s mission or purpose
—A common approach to working, together or individually
—A mutual understanding of how to make decisions and assess risk
What it’s not:
—A common educational, cultural or career background
—A sense of comfort and familiarity with co-workers
—Shared enjoyment of such perks as ping pong and craft beer

95609,"<h3>ECB Signals Rate Cut, Possible Stimulus Relaunch</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Central bank is examining a return to asset purchases, a major policy shift

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 25,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:30 pm ET

FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it is preparing to cut short-term interest rates for the first time <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016 and</span> restart a giant bond-buying program, in a significant policy shift that aims to insulate the wobbling eurozone economy from global headwinds ranging from trade tensions to Brexit.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The move underscores the ECB’s activism under its departing President Mario Draghi, whose aggressive stimulus policies recently caught the attention of President Trump.</span> Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Draghi in a series of tweets last month, complaining that the Italian official had weakened the euro at the expense of U.S. firms, but later suggested he might like to hire Mr. Draghi for the Federal Reserve.

The ECB’s decisions over the coming weeks will be felt long after Mr. Draghi steps down in October.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">While it stopped short of immediate action, the ECB’s clear signal of intent raises the pressure on other major central banks, including the Fed, to follow suit with interest-rate cuts.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Fed is widely expected to lower interest rates for the first time in over a decade when it meets next week.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">In a statement, the ECB said it was “determined to act” to prop up inflation rates that have persistently undershot the central bank’s target of just <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 2%,</span> which the economic slowdown puts further out of reach.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It said it was expecting to keep its key interest rate at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.4% or</span> lower through the first half <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020.</span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The economic outlook “is getting worse and worse,” especially in manufacturing, Mr. Draghi said at a press conference on Thursday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Basically we don’t like what we see on the inflation front.”

</span>The ECB said it had asked staff committees to examine policy options including the possible design of a new bond-buying program. It has previously used such language to signal that fresh action is imminent.

The ECB’s next policy meeting is on Sept.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12.</span> “It now increasingly looks as if the September meeting will not only bring a single measure but rather a package of several measures,” ING Bank analysts said.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Investors initially cheered the news, sending bond prices up and some yields to fresh lows, while also lifting European bank stocks and selling the euro.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But those moves all reversed as it became clear that Mr. Draghi would present no details of the stimulus package for now.

</span>Germany’s 10-year government bond yield hit a record low of <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.461% but</span> later rose again as some investors sold bonds, settling at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.406% in</span> the afternoon. Similarly, the euro also fell to its lowest level in more than two years, but bounced back to be <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.24% on</span> the day <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.117.</span>

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Major central banks, from Asia to Europe, have signaled a return to ultralow interest rates in recent months amid mounting threats in the global economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Central bankers are eager to act early to safeguard the long economic expansion because they appear to have limited policy space to counteract any recession with interest rates already low.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The eurozone economy is still expanding and its inflation rate is <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 1%,</span> not far from the ECB’s target.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That is a marked change from the ECB’s last major round of stimulus in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016,</span> when the currency union was flirting with deflation, or a cycle of falling prices.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Still, economic indicators have started to flash red in recent months as the region’s export-focused firms emerged as victims of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

</span>The ECB’s early signal could help to reassure investors that the central bank still has the firepower to cope with fresh turbulence.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">A move in September would simplify the early part of the term of Mr. Draghi’s likely successor, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, by not confronting her with immediate decisions about how to handle the slowdown.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A former lawyer and French finance minister, Ms. Lagarde has no experience in central banking, although Mr. Draghi called her an outstanding choice on Thursday, pointing to her work at the IMF.

</span>But it also raises legal and practical questions about how much more the ECB can accomplish with its current toolbox. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The bank’s key interest rate is already below zero and its balance sheet has swollen to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 40% of</span> eurozone economic output, double that of the Federal Reserve.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">“The ECB is still very optimistic and positive about the results delivered by negative interest rates and asset purchases.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">I’m more skeptical in this respect,” Juergen Stark, the ECB’s former chief economist, said in a recent interview.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 0.1 percentage</span> point interest-rate cut, which is being priced in by investors, “is nothing, there will be no impact,” Mr. Stark said.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, a fresh round of bond purchases “will continue disturbing markets, and prices do not reflect the risk anymore,” he said.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The ECB phased out its controversial €2.6 trillion bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing or QE, in December, amid signs that the region’s economy was strengthening.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">To restart the program, the ECB would likely need to alter self-imposed rules that prohibit the bank from buying more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 33% of</span> any individual government’s debt.

</span>Doing so would likely trigger fresh legal concerns in Germany, whose top court is still assessing lawsuits that challenge the legality of QE. A hearing in the case is scheduled for next week.

In an ominous signal, Mr. Draghi indicated that some ECB officials had opposed parts of the bank’s policy statement on Thursday. German central-bank President Jens Weidmann has been an outspoken critic of the ECB’s bond purchases, although he has softened his tone in recent months.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Critics argue that the ECB’s easy-money policies hurt the region’s economy over time, including by keeping unproductive “zombie” companies alive, which weighs on the region’s growth prospects.

</span>“All this is not thought through, [it is] just to be activist and show we are not at the end of our toolbox,” Mr. Stark said.

Ukraine Live Updates:<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 Days</span> of War Feel Like a ‘Long, Difficult Day’
Kyiv’s mayor called the past few months “a time of courage and perseverance.” Analysts and officials say no end to the conflict is in sight.
As the war in Ukraine stretched beyond its 100th day on Saturday, analysts, officials and Ukrainians were saying that there was no end in sight for a brutal conflict that has gutted the country, displaced many of its people and shattered its sense of security.
With the Ukrainian and Russian armies locked in grueling town-by-town battles along a 600-mile-long front, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, warned this week that the conflict had become a “war of attrition” and advised allies to be prepared for “the long haul.” Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said that the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine might not look all that different in another<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 Days</span>.
Russia also appeared to be girding for a protracted war with no clear timeline. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Friday that Russia would continue what it calls a “special operation” in Ukraine until “all goals have been attained.”
For the people of Ukraine, the past<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 Days</span> have felt “like one long, difficult day,” Vitali Klitschko, mayor of the capital, Kyiv, wrote on Telegram.
“Emotions, hard work, bloody battles, losses and deaths,” he wrote. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“However, a time of courage and perseverance.”
Analysts have said that efforts by the United States and other countries to give Ukraine the upper hand with a supply of increasingly powerful weapons heightens the risk that NATO is one misstep away from being drawn into a far broader, bloodier conflict.</span> Mr. Stoltenberg told reporters this week that NATO had a responsibility to prevent the war from becoming a “full-fledged” conflict between Russia and the alliance.
“That will cause even more death, even more destruction, even more damage,” he said.
In other developments:
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said Friday that “victory will be ours” and noted overnight <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 50 foreign</span> embassies had resumed “their full-fledged activities” in Kyiv, part of the fragile sense of normalcy returning to the capital.
Marriott said it was suspending operations in Russia after determining that restrictions set by Western governments would make it impossible for the company to operate or franchise hotels there. Marriott, which said it had been operating in Russia <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span></span>, joins a long list of multinational companies pulling out of the country amid sanctions.
Mr. Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland in Washington on Friday, and discussed the country’s application to the military alliance. He said he had also had a “constructive phone call” with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about Mr. Erdogan’s concerns about Sweden and Finland joining NATO.
Ukrainian troops have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span></span> in Russia’s fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in the eastern province of Luhansk, the regional military administrator said in a television interview. He had previously said that most of the industrial city had been taken over by the Russians.
SIVERSK DISTRICT, Ukraine — One of the few civilians still driving on a road leading toward the battle front, Oleksandr Chaplik skidded to a stop and leaned out the car window to swap information with a villager.
He was taking supplies back to his village, one of a handful still in Ukrainian hands that lie in the path of the Russian advance.
“We are surrounded on all sides,” said Mr. Chaplik,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> a dairy and livestock farmer. “It is the second month without light, without water, without gas, without communication, without the internet, without news. Basically, horror.”
“But people need to eat,” he said. “I am a businessman. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">So I am doing my job.”
Mr. Chaplik owns <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75 acres</span> of land near the city of Sievierodonetsk, where Russian and Ukrainian troops have been battling for control in heavy street fighting in recent days.</span> The countryside around his farm is under almost constant bombardment by Russian forces trying to encircle the easternmost Ukrainian forces and lay siege to Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.
The roar of multiple rocket launcher systems being fired south of the farm rattled the windows and doors of his home. “Don’t worry, those are Ukrainian,” he said as he gave a tour of his farm. “Here, thank God, the guys are holding firm.”

100 mileS</span>
But the war has come dangerously close. Craters from bombs and artillery shells scar his fields. Leaning against the wall of one of his barns stood the casings of a dozen rockets that Mr. Chaplik had collected from around the farm. The rockets delivered cluster bombs, he said, which still littered his hayfields.
“They want to be eating grass,” he said as he walked down the stalls of <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 35 dairy</span> cows. “But I cannot let the cows loose on this grass because of these bombs, and I am scared they will fall in the bomb craters.”
Mr. Chaplik is a fraying connection to the world for his increasingly isolated village, which he asked not be named so it would not suffer retribution from Russian troops. At considerable risk to himself, he provides vital supplies and information, and keeps producing food as best he can.
Many other farmers have left the area but he said he could not. “I can’t leave the people,” he said. “If I leave, I will not be able to return to the village, I will not be able to look people in the eye.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">But as the war has crept closer, he has had to shrink his business while trying to keep the farm producing and workers fed and paid.</span> With utilities cut off, he runs the milk machines on generators, but can only operate his refrigerators <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 hours</span> a day.
“We used to make <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 100 different</span> milk products,” he said. “I have a two-years-old Parmesan cheese. I made unique products that no one else was making, sour cream, cream, mozzarella, burrata.”
But without electricity he has had to cut down on production. There was a shortage of containers, he added. He removed two cheeses with moldy rinds from a fridge. “They are no good,” he said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">He has moved his food production operations to several different parts of the country, placing part of his dairy production in the nearby market town of Bakhmut, where he already has an organic meat and dairy shop, and relocating his meat production plants to the relatively safe cities of Dnipro and Lviv.
</span>His family has moved, too. His wife is a teacher and two of his children are university students, so they needed to go somewhere with the internet to be able to keep working, he said. They were calling him daily, pleading with him to join them, but he said he still had work to do.
His work force has contracted, as many villagers left with their families for safer parts of the country. “I have fields and machines and diesel but I do not have the workers,” he said. But he pulled together <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 workers</span> who remained, so they now live and eat together.
Two teenage girls were mucking out the cow stalls. “They are the daughters of my workers. They are children, but I have no workers,” he said.
A pensioner, Lyudmila,<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 68,</span> has stepped in to run his shop in the village.
“Did you get cucumbers?” she called out, as Mr. Chaplik unloaded bottled water and fresh vegetables from his van.
“Without him we would be lost,” she said. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Villagers could not travel to the market, and prices there were much higher anyway, she said.
</span>But the strain shows on Mr. Chaplik’s face. He looks like he has not slept in days. He complained of toothache and a twitch around his eye. One of the hardest things, he said, was fielding the panicked telephone calls from relatives trying to reach the villagers who have remained behind. The cellphone service in the village has been knocked out <span id=""5"" class=""red"">but they know that Mr. Chaplik drives into town every day to the market, where cell service continues, and they bombard him with calls.
</span>“My nerves are cracking,” he said, as he declined another phone call. “I am <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">working 14 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 hours</span> a day. Physically I am tired.”
So now he is arranging for his son to bring in a mobile antenna, so the villagers can be in touch with their relatives.
He sees more problems on the horizon. The war has disrupted farming and food production to such an extent that people in eastern Ukraine could go hungry in coming months, he warned.
The potatoes are already planted, which will provide food for the villagers, he said, but meat and milk will become scarce.
“If I do not prepare feed for my cows they will die this winter,” he said. “I cannot cut the hay because of the cluster bombs in the fields and I <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">need 12,000 bales</span> of hay and I do not have the workers.”
And as he follows the progress of the war, and the steady advance of Russian troops, he said it was likely that they would seize control of the village and he would lose the farm that he built up over more <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 years</span>.
Separatist forces backed by Russia seized the area <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 but</span> were pushed back after a few months. But this time he said he did not expect President Vladimir V. Putin to stop. The Russian leader wants to seize a swathe of the country from the city of Kharkiv in the northeast to Odessa in the southwest, he said.
“He will not calm down,” he said. “He will fight for a year, two, three, until he reaches his goal.”
Mr. Chaplik has been slaughtering his pigs, so only one remains, slumbering in his pen. The newborn calves will have to be slaughtered too, he said. “It’s a shame.”
If the Russians came, he added, he would have to leave his guard dogs, six German shepherds. “I could not bear to put them down,” he said. “I will let them loose.”
If the shells came too close, he would take his workers and leave, he said. “I will start anew,” he said. “Give me a little piece of land, in Ukraine, in the United States, wherever. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">I can build a great business again.”

Russia’s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine’s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war, the British Defense Ministry said. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Russian reliance on deep strikes has probably depleted the country’s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.

Ukrainian troops engaging in a block-by-block fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in Luhansk Province, have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span></span>, the regional military administrator, Serhiy Haidai, said in a television interview. He had previously said that most of the industrial city had been taken over by the Russians.
According to a report by the United Nations Development Program, the State Emergency Services of Ukraine have <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">removed 127,393 explosive</span> devices, with the efforts focused mostly on urban areas in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. Russia’s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said.
In his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also used the 100th day of war as a way of focusing on how numbers have come to define the war: the number of those killed or wounded, or the number of attacks launched against the country. Particularly haunting is the number of children who have been killed in the war, which Mr. Zelensky said <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 261 as</span> of Friday morning, a number that could not be independently identified. “For what?"" Mr. Zelensky asked. “There are no words that can answer this question.”
Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said in a Twitter message that he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland while the two officials were in Washington on Friday and discussed Finland’s application to NATO. Mr. Stoltenberg also said he had a “constructive phone call” with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about Mr. Erdogan's concerns with Sweden and Finland joining NATO.

Reporting from New York
António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, marked the 100th day of war in Ukraine by calling for a halt to violence, access for humanitarian aid and protection and evacuation of civilians. “Resolving this conflict will require negotiations and dialogue. The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world,” said Mr. Guterres in a statement on Friday. He said the U.N. stands ready to help in those efforts.
RENO, Nev. — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out several American cities for having sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.
Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the gathering of mayors just after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago; Jacksonville, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; San Diego and San Jose, Calif., for maintaining sister-city ties in Russia. He said those relationships should be severed.
“What do those ties give to you? Probably nothing,” Mr. Zelensky said. “But they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.”
Chicago announced earlier this year that it was suspending, but not permanently ending, its sister-city relationship with Moscow, which had been in place <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1997.</span> Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister-city relationship with Ekaterinburg, Russia. As of Friday, websites for the sister-city programs in Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.
Many American municipalities have sister-city relationships in several countries. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Though the partnerships can include business and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local nonprofit organizations.
</span>But Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the mayors<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 Days</span> after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia even the smallest bit of added credibility.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Don’t make any excuses; don’t maintain relations with Russia,” said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech received applause from the mayors and city employees who had gathered in Reno, Nev. “And please don’t let those who became murderers call your cities their sister cities.”
</span>Officials in Portland referred to a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners. Officials in the other American cities that Mr. Zelensky named did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The nightly address from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday was an impassioned one, reflecting on how<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100 Days</span> of war has dramatically altered the country’s vocabulary, redefining or introducing new words, terms and phrases into Ukrainians’ everyday language. ""One hundred days -- one hundred words,"" he said, as he listed the words as a way to look back at more than three months of war. Justice, heroes, reconstruction, security and liberation are among the words guiding the country forward and giving it hope, Mr. Zelensky said, including what he referred to as the three most important words underpinning their fight: “peace, victory, Ukraine.”
Mr. Zelensky added that he hopes many words that have become common in Ukraine will one day be relegated to the past. Words such as filtration, deportation and torture. But he also used the milestone to offer inspiration. “When we hear the word ‘Patron,’ we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine,” he said, referring to the bomb-sniffing dog he awarded with state honors last month.
DAKAR, Senegal — A meeting on Friday between the head of the African Union and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia highlighted the acute needs each one hopes the other can fill: Africa needs food, and the Kremlin needs allies.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Russia’s blockade of Ukraine, ordinarily a major exporter of grain, has worsened food crises in Africa and the Middle East, and the African Union chief, President Macky Sall of Senegal, said the grain should be freed up.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">“Our countries, although they are far from the theater, are victims of this crisis on an economic level,” Mr. Sall said at a joint news conference with Mr. Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</span>At the same time, Mr. Sall told Mr. Putin, whom he called his “dear friend Vladimir,” that Western sanctions on Russia had compounded Africa’s lack of access to grain — an argument Moscow has been making. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Mr. Sall explicitly called for the lifting of restrictions on exports of Russian wheat and fertilizer.
</span>Mr. Sall’s comments were something of a diplomatic victory for Mr. Putin. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">European leaders have accused the Russian president of creating a global food crisis by blocking wheat exports and seizing Ukrainian grain, all the while trying to blame shortages on sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.
</span>Global food stocks were already low before the invasion, and the war has made the shortfall worse. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">African countries import more <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 40 percent</span> of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">The United Nations says food prices worldwide <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 23 percent</span> higher than a year ago, reflecting the tight supply.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">The United States and its allies have condemned the invasion of Ukraine and have cut most economic ties to Russia, leaving Moscow with fewer diplomatic and trading partners.
</span>But Russia has longstanding ties to many African countries, some dating to its Soviet-era support for liberation struggles against colonial rulers. Mr. Putin has cultivated those relations and has so far mitigated criticism from most African countries.
Mr. Putin gathered African leaders in Sochi <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 and</span> has positioned the continent as key to Russia’s interests, while France and the United States have withdrawn from involvement in some conflicts there.
With little investment, Russia has made itself a central player on the continent, becoming Africa’s largest supplier of arms, propping up authoritarian leaders and portraying itself as being on the side of African countries in their fight for more independence from the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia.
“Those friends and allies Russia needs, it can find them on the African continent, so it wants to keep such relations tight,” said Pauline Bax, an expert on Africa with the International Crisis Group.
Still, such efforts have paid off. Russia has managed to mute criticism of its invasion of Ukraine among leaders in Africa but also in Asia and Latin America.
In April, the United Nations General Assembly <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">voted 93 to</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24 to</span> exclude Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. But most African nations either voted against the measure, abstained or simply did not cast a vote, including countries usually aligned with the views of Western countries, like Senegal, a regional peace broker.
Gilles Yabi, the director of the Wathi research group in Dakar, said the vote created some surprise outside Africa, revealing a perception in the United States and Europe that African countries would not act independently in the crisis.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“The ramifications of the conflict for Africa are economic,” Mr. Yabi said.</span> “It’s legitimate that African countries look at the war according to their interests.”
Appearing with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Sall claimed, erroneously, that “despite enormous pressure, the majority of African countries have avoided to condemn Russia in this situation.” At <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 30 of</span> Africa’<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 54 countries</span> have condemned the invasion in some fashion, though generally without the vehemence seen in Washington or European capitals.
Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied Russia’s relations with Africa, said the United States and Europe liked to think that Russia has been isolated since it invaded Ukraine.
“Macky Sall’s visit on behalf of the African Union, the votes at the U.N., show that Russia might be isolated from America, Europe, Taiwan and Japan, but necessarily not from the rest of the world,” he said.
The African Union has vowed to remain in a neutral position in the conflict, and Mr. Sall has tried to cast himself as a potential mediator. Yet in practice, some analysts say, the African Union has showed deference to Russia.
That was evident when, after his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Sall was scheduled to fly back to Africa on Friday without meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
In addition, Mr. Zelensky has asked for months to address the African Union, and even though Mr. Sall said this week that the Ukrainian leader could soon address the organization in a videoconference, no date has been announced.
Joseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an arm of the Pentagon’s National Defense University, noted that Mr. Putin has tried to portray his invasion of Ukraine as an ideological battle against the West. That message has resonated across Africa, he said.
Mr. Putin has even used the looming grain shortage to cast the United States and its allies in bad light, he said. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“He is twisting the narrative to suggest that the sanctions are causing the pain and price inflation for food across the globe, rather than acknowledging that the entire food crisis related to the conflict is his making,” Mr. Siegle said.

The skies around Sievierodonetsk are heavy with smoke as Ukraine battles Russia for the eastern city.
SIVERSK, Ukraine — The skies around Sievierodonetsk were heavy with smoke on Friday, with artillery fire and explosions sounding on and off throughout the day as Russian and Ukrainian forces traded blows in a fierce battle for the eastern city.
Ukrainian troops were moving heavy guns and howitzers along the roads toward the frontline, pouring men and armor into the fight as Russian artillery targeted Ukrainian guns.
Russian rockets pummeled an area near Sievierodonetsk late Friday afternoon, landing with multiple heavy explosions that were audible from a nearby village. Grad missiles streaked through the sky from Ukrainian-held territory toward Russian positions.
Russian forces have been edging ever closer to seizing Sievierodonetsk and taking total control of the Luhansk region, part of the broader area known as Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. Capturing the industrial Donbas region could give Mr. Putin a victory to herald to the Russian people.
But Ukraine on Friday was battling to hang on in Sievierodonetsk, underscoring the government’s determination to resist Russia’s onslaught until the arrival of heavier weapons from the West that could potentially help turn the war in its favor.
The head of the Ukrainian military administration in the region, Serhiy Haidai, said Friday that at least one person had been killed in Sievierodonetsk and that the battle was ongoing in the heart of the city. He said that Russian forces maintained their grip on a highway that had acted as a conduit both for people seeking to flee the city as well as for incoming supplies.
That highway runs southwest from Sievierodonetsk across the Seversky Donets River, through the adjoining city of Lysychansk and on to the city of Bakmut in Donetsk province.
Russian artillery has targeted the road, as well as several towns and villages along the route, part of Moscow’s bid to tighten its grip on Luhansk, a province where it already holds almost all of the land. Russia has massed its forces in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in the Donbas region after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, early in the conflict.
A British intelligence report said on Friday that Russian forces were “achieving tactical success” in Luhansk and had momentum, noting that they should be able to take full control of the province in the next two weeks. Mr. Haidai has disputed that analysis.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">The United States, Britain and Germany all said this week they would supply Ukraine with missile systems that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky had sought to offset Russia’s advantage in long-range artillery.</span> But it is not clear when those weapons will arrive or how a possible new Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks will take shape.
Until then, Ukrainian attempts to slow Moscow’s progress in the Donbas could deplete Russia of both personnel and arms.
“Russian forces continued to make incremental, grinding, and costly progress in eastern Ukraine,” said a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Local residents and Ukrainian officials in the area of Sievierodonetsk said Friday that Ukrainian forces were still holding their own — even pushing back some Russian forces.
One Ukrainian reporter for Radio Liberty traveled in with the Ukrainian army across the last standing bridge into the city. Two Reuters journalists were wounded and their driver was killed after their vehicle, which had been provided by Russia-backed forces, came under fire while heading to Sievierodonetsk on a Russian-held part of road, according to the news agency.
Reporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine
Amidst stretchers, camouflage netting and bloodstained medical gear, Ukrainian soldiers were examined by medical personnel at a makeshift aid station in Bakhmut, only a few miles west of the Donetsk and Luhansk regional border, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Seeking to leverage a global food crisis to get relief from international sanctions, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said on Friday that Ukrainian grain could travel by rail through his country to ports on the Baltic Sea, but only if Belarus is allowed to use the same ports to export its own goods.
</span>Mr. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Moscow, made the offer in a telephone conversation with the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, according to Belta, the Belarusian state news agency.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Russia has blockaded Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea, which were previously the main export route for Ukrainian grain and oilseeds.</span> The war has left <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 25 million</span> tons of grain stranded in silos and at risk of rotting away unless it is moved soon.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">U.N. officials have warned the blockade will cause rising prices and severe food shortages, particularly in Africa, where famines are possible.</span> Moscow has said it would consider letting grain shipments through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. Ukraine’s allies have been seeking alternative overland routes.
Belarus controls the railway lines that offer the most direct, cheapest and fastest route for large volumes of grain to be shipped out of Ukraine to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and other Baltic ports.
But getting access to those rail lines has been complicated because Belarus is allied with Russia in the current conflict. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Belarus was a staging ground for Russia’s Feb.<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24 invasion</span> of Ukraine, and Mr. Lukashenko has expressed fury at Western sanctions on what had been his country’s biggest export earner, potash fertilizer.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Belarus, which is landlocked, exported nearly all its potash through the port at Klaipeda until Feb.<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> when Lithuania halted the traffic, severing a vital economic artery for Mr. Lukashenko.
</span>Mr. Lukashenko’s offer to Mr. Guterres seems to be a gambit to restore that lifeline. Ukraine is desperate to start shipping trapped grain before this year’s harvest adds tens of millions more tons, and Kyiv has been relatively open to a deal with Mr. Lukashenko. Other countries, including Lithuania, however, are strongly opposed to cutting Belarus any slack.
Belta reported that the U.N. chief had “asked for a short pause of a few days to talk with the leadership of the countries concerned.”"

Even our fantasies are being downsized.

Neiman Marcus Group Inc. mailed out its annual Christmas Book catalog, which each year features over-the-top ""fantasy"" gifts, to one million customers on Tuesday. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">But for the first time in a decade, there isn't a seven- or eight-figure price tag on the list.

</span>The most expensive fantasy item <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2009 is</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $250,000 </span>""his and hers"" two-seater Icon aircraft, which comes with pilot training for two. That's a far cry from <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $20 million</span> submarine offered <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $10 million</span></span> Zeppelin <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2004 or</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $10 million</span></span> stable of racehorses <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2008.</span></span>

Such gifts aren't really expected to sell—just one of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus fantasy gifts in the past decade actually found a buyer. But the holiday catalog, which has included a handful of outrageous items since 1959—when Neiman put a Black Angus steer with a rolling roast-beef cart in its catalog—has long been the last word in luxury, a potent symbol of shoppers' aspirations.

Neiman Marcus is not the only store downplaying dreams. This year, Saks Inc.'s Saks Fifth Avenue is discontinuing its practice of marketing ""dreams by design"" or ""wow"" fantasy gift experiences such as a walk-on role in an American Ballet Theatre production sold in an online auction, with bids that started <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $3,000.</span>

The cuts reflect prolonged frugality among upscale shoppers. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year have fallen by double-digit percentages <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 straight</span> months.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">U.S. sales of luxury goods are expected to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drop 15% this</span> year, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The dour economic climate has also bred distaste for conspicuous consumption.</span> Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus who is also its corporate gift scout, denies that the absence of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1 million</span>-plus gift is meant to make a statement. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">This year, ""I didn't see anything that I thought was fabulous"" in that price range, she says.</span> But Ms. Reeder examined the cultural mindset as part of her gift-creating process, and the themes she found, such as compassion for the earth, don't seem to square with million-dollar merchandise.

Now awaiting buyers: the ""world's fastest"" electric motorcycle, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $73,000</span>; artwork of insect lab specimens with antique watch parts, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $8,500</span>; and five-foot-long, ""sustainable"" chandeliers made from cut and sanded plastic soda bottles rescued from the landfill, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $12,000.</span> Overall, close <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50% of</span> the merchandise in this year's Neiman catalog costs less <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $250,</span> compared with <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30% to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40% in</span> the past five years.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Before luxury-goods sales came to a halt last fall, retailers viewed fantasy gifts as powerful marketing tools.</span> The idea was that even those who couldn't afford to buy the over-the-top items would want to buy something from a brand with such cachet. Neiman Marcus usually sold less than half of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 or</span> so items on its fantasy-gift list—and sometimes only the limited-edition cars.

But the publicity given to, say, <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $20 million</span> submarine (2000) had its own value. <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2006,</span> Neiman Marcus, which is owned by private-equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, estimated that it would have had to spend at <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $9 million</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $12 million</span> on advertising to get the television exposure it received from that year's gift list, which included <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.76 million</span> spaceship ride.

By the time the number of high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. peaked <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> retailers were scrambling to outdo one another in their catalogs and on their Web sites. There were ""limited-production,"" ""one-of-a-kind"" and ""once-in-a-lifetime"" luxury offerings from companies like Victoria's Secret, which touted jewel-encrusted bras for the holidays. <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 2008 bra</span>, featuring black diamonds and rubies, was priced <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $5 million</span>.</span> (None of the fantasy bras offered by Victoria's Secret each holiday <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1996 has</span> ever sold, though a 42-carat Harry Winston diamond on <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2004 bra</span> found a buyer.)

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">A spokesman for Saks says the holiday catalog will continue to carry high-end jewelry and other designer items this year, in addition to lower-priced items.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">A representative of Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc. said the price and carat weight of <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2009 fantasy</span> bra will be announced later this month.

</span>Now, luxury retailers are facing a significant decline in Americans' net worth. The World Wealth Report, published in late June by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini Consulting, estimates that the wealth of America's high-net-worth individuals (those who hold at <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $1 million</span> in investible assets) plunged by more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 22% in</span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2008.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">While consumer confidence has climbed slightly, and some shoppers are willing to spend a little more this season, most are restricting themselves to practical purchases and forgoing designer clothing and accessories that may go out of fashion quickly.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The National Retail Federation said Tuesday that it expects U.S. retail sales to fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2005 levels</span> in the coming holiday season, though the expected decline <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1% isn</span>'t as deep as <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 3.4% plunge</span> of <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 holiday</span> season.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Some industry observers, such as Monica Aggarwal, a Fitch Ratings analyst, expect the sales declines at luxury retailers to continue until <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2010 or</span><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span>

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Still, the size of the expected decline in luxury-goods sales this holiday season is an improvement over last year's miserable results.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Sales of luxury merchandise are set to fall <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2% in</span> November and December, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">In last year's holiday period, it estimates, such sales fell <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%.</span>

</span>And Neiman still has quirky dreams on offer. Two of the nine fantasy gifts this year are alcohol-related ""experiences."" There's <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $20,000 wine</span> and art visit to the Napa Valley vineyard owned by Kathryn and Craig Hall, and <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $7,500 trip</span> to the distillery for Maker's Mark bourbon in Louisville, Ky., with two bottles included.

Then there's <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $25,000 electric</span> car in the shape of a cupcake. ""You sit in it and pull the top of the cupcake down over you,"" explains Ms. Reeder, who lost her assistant gift scout in a wave of layoffs that took place at Neiman Marcus earlier this year. ""This isn't street-legal,"" she adds. ""It's for someone who wants to impress the neighborhood at the Fourth of July parade."" The cupcake, she confesses, ""was a last-minute addition because I thought we needed some whimsy.<span id=""15"" class=""red"">""

At any price level, the Neiman Marcus holiday catalog attracts customers' attention.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Robin Hopkins, of Alexandria, Ala., says, ""I'd still like to see"" the over-the-top gifts, even in the economic downturn.</span> She sometimes purchases smaller items from the holiday catalog, she says. However, she adds, ""The fantasy gifts are just fantasies in my world.""

89039,"<h3>U.S. Ally South Korea Nears Pivotal Election</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Presidential Vote Comes as Economic and Territorial Tensions Rise; Candidate Reaches Out to Her Father's Foes for Help

Updated Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 8</span>:01 pm ET

JEONJU, South Korea—Park Geun-hye is vying to become South Korea's first woman president.</span> To do so, she is reaching out to some of the people who were arrested, jailed and even exiled when her father was president in the 1960s and 1970s.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Wednesday's election comes at a pivotal time for both Asia and for South Korea, a key U.S. ally and a growing economic force in the world.</span> Korean brands like Samsung, LG and Hyundai have become household names around the world. South Korea borders the country that poses the greatest security risk in Asia, nuclear-armed North Korea. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">And economic and territorial tensions are rising between its two largest trading partners and bigger neighbors, China and Japan.

</span>National polls until recently showed the conservative Ms. Park as the front-runner for the presidential election. The latest polls, taken in the middle of last week, indicated a tossup between her and her liberal opponent, Moon Jae-in.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">South Korea's next president will face many of the problems that Japan—whose economic model it has most closely emulated—did two decades ago: slowing growth rates, rising competitive pressure from lower-income countries, and an aging society.</span> By the end of the next president's term <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> South Korea's working-age population will have started to shrink.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon promise a more centrist approach to the economy than current President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who lowered corporate taxes and pursued a weak currency to help the nation's exporters.</span> The candidates support big increases in health care and other welfare programs and will likely raise taxes to pay for it.

Ms. Park's welfare pledges include free treatment for cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses. Though not as expansive as Mr. Moon's, they represent a significant shift to the middle from when she ran for president five years ago and narrowly lost the conservative party nomination to Mr. Lee.

On security matters, Ms. Park favors diplomatic engagement and what she calls ""trust building"" with North Korea. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Moon wants to go further by returning to the few-questions-asked economic assistance South Korea provided to the North under the most recent liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun.</span> Mr. Moon was Mr. Roh's presidential chief of staff.

North Korea injected itself into the election last week by firing a long-range missile. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon criticized Pyongyang, and, with South Koreans accustomed to the North's provocations, it hasn't turned into a major issue.

While the division between North Korea and South Korea is most visible to the world, another division exists inside the South that is nearly as sharp. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">It is between the country's southeastern provinces, which were home to most of its industry and benefited most from the economic choices of Ms. Park's father in the 1960s and 1970s, and its southwestern ones, which spawned the democracy movement that rebelled against him.

</span>Mr. Moon,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59 years</span> old, is from the country's southeastern province, the conservative power base. His election to parliament in April was the first time a liberal had been elected from his district in Busan, the country's second-largest city. His campaign is trying to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 40% support</span> in the province for the presidential race, a spokeswoman said, exceeding what a liberal candidate has done before.

Ms. Park,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60,</span> entered politics <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span></span> She repeatedly won election to the national parliament from a city in the conservative southeast.

In one of the biggest gambles of her presidential campaign, she is making a play for the liberal southwestern provinces. Aides for Ms. Park say they hope to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 15% to</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20% of</span> the vote, beating <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 9% that</span> Mr. Lee got in <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2007 election</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">She is tackling the centuries-old division between the regions that widened when Ms. Park's father seized control and set the country on a course of government-led economic development.</span> He clung to power beyond what South Korea's constitution allowed—and, in the 1970s, changed it twice to suit his military-backed regime. He accepted no dissent, controlled the press and, for a time, wouldn't allow people to congregate on the streets in groups of more than six.

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 1974,</span> a North Korean agent fired shots at him during a speech. As security agents took down the would-be assassin, a stray bullet struck Ms. Park's mother, who died a few hours later. <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Then 22,</span> Ms. Park took on the role of first lady, presiding over ceremonies and hosting state events until her father was shot and killed by his security chief <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1979.</span>

She withdrew from the spotlight through the 1980s, the period when South Korea formed a middle class and democracy activism spread beyond the university campuses and leftist groups. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1987,</span> a new constitution formed the country's modern political system, with presidents elected to single, five-year terms.

As <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1987 constitution</span> took effect, many people who had fled or were exiled in the 1970s returned to South Korea. Among them was Kim Kyung-jae, who had his passport revoked while on a trip to the U.S. <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1972,</span> then wrote books critical of Ms. Park's father.

He returned to South Jeolla province in the southwest and became an aide to a prominent anti-Park antagonist elected as president <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997.</span></span> Mr. Kim later won election himself to parliament.

There, he was assigned to a committee with Ms. Park. But while they often sat near each other, Mr. Kim says he never spoke to her because he wasn't sure how to break the ice. ""I had written a five-volume book criticizing her father,"" he said.

Two years ago, with her eyes set on <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 race</span>, Ms. Park asked aides to reach out to associates of her father's antagonist, the former liberal President Kim Dae-jung, who died <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span> She wanted to discuss issues and their potential support, officials with her campaign said, knowing that some of the former associates had been alienated by younger leaders from the liberal party and might help her pick up some votes in the southwestern provinces.

In a written answer to questions submitted to her campaign, Ms. Park said she wants to end South Korea's regional division. ""I also believe that national unity cannot be achieved solely through reconciling with the past,"" she wrote. Ms. Park also said she would seek ""more balanced development between regions.""

She isn't the first president trying to bridge the gap. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1999,</span> the second year of his presidency, Kim Dae-jung visited the birthplace of Ms. Park's father and announced a plan to build a memorial park to the man he had fought for years, saying Mr. Park had instilled South Koreans with a ""can-do spirit.""

<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2004,</span> about a year after the president had left office, Ms. Park visited his home in Seoul and apologized for the suffering he experienced at her father's hand and thanked him for the park. ""I tried hard but still failed to accomplish regional harmony,"" the former president told her, according to Korean media reports at the time. ""I think you are the right person to seek it.""

In the statement provided by the campaign, Ms. Park said she remembered the former president's admonition. ""I wholeheartedly agreed with President Kim's aspirations,"" she said.

This August, the day after winning her party's nomination, Ms. Park visited the graves of all of South Korea's former presidents, in what she called an effort at national unity. But in early September, she appeared to agree with a controversial verdict against dissidents by her father's government. Some people felt she was criticizing those who stood up to her father.

Ms. Park called Kim Kyung-jae, her former committee mate, for help, Mr. Kim said. He said he told her that he remained critical of her father and that she needed to clear the air about the other activists.

On Sept.<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> Ms. Park gave a 10-minute, televised speech in which she criticized her father in the strongest terms she had ever expressed publicly. But she added that he was still her father.

""Respected people, I don't believe that you really want me to spit on my father's grave,"" she said in the speech. ""Looking back, so many people tried hard for industrialization and democratization. Now, I think we need to put our efforts together, with respect, for even bigger national development.""

Shortly after the speech, Mr. Kim said Ms. Park called him. He said that he told her, ""It was much stronger than I imagined. Now I will help you."" A campaign spokesman said Mr. Kim joined the campaign after the speech, but he said he couldn't verify details of Ms. Park's conversations.

Mr. Kim joined Han Gwang-ok, who had been presidential chief of staff to Kim Dae-jung, at the head of the national unity committee inside Ms. Park's campaign.

Mr. Han, who was imprisoned twice by her father's regime, had similarly been recruited for months by Ms. Park's aides. He said he remembered Kim Dae-jung's goodwill to Ms. Park after <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">her 2004 meeting</span> with the former president.

""In life, there are things to quickly leave off and things to hang on to,"" Mr. Han said. ""The things to throw away are the unpleasant things from the past. The things to keep are patriotism and how to live the rest of life with dignity.""

Kim Hyun-jang, an activist in the South Jeolla city of Gwangju who was imprisoned for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1982 arson</span> at a U.S. cultural center that was one of the most violent acts of the democracy movement, also joined Ms. Park's campaign. Unlike the former politicians, he said he had no difficult rationalizing his support for Ms. Park with his disdain for her father. ""In that time, there was no freedom at all,"" he said. ""Everything is different.""

The three men and others have been meeting friends and associates in the Jeolla provinces to court voters. But they often have been received coolly. A columnist at a Gwangju newspaper called them ""political migratory birds.""

Others are willing to give her a chance. Ms. Park recently spoke at at Chonbuk National University in North Jeolla. ""There are still regional objections to her,"" said Kim Du-yong, a student who watched her. ""She can overcome them if she brings investment here.""

Kim Kyung-jae, who stood with Ms. Park on the stage in Jeonju, said afterward that some of his friends and former constituents in the area call him a ""betrayer"" for helping her. ""I admit some of their criticisms, but still I think I have some influence on Jeolla voters,"" he said.

Updated <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 24,</span></span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 3</span>:11 am ET

The euro, French government bonds and European stocks jumped sharply in the wake of the first round of France’s presidential election, with centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron edging out far-right politician Marine Le Pen

Europe’s common currency rose as much <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1.9% to</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1.0935,</span> its highest level against the dollar since November.</span> Against the Japanese yen, the euro surged as <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">high 120.82,</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 3.3%.</span> Gains moderated in recent action, with the euro <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 1.2% against</span> the dollar <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2.1% against</span> the yen.

Traders drove down the spread between French and German government bonds, which had widened during the presidential campaign. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The 10-year French bond <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">yielded 0.76% in</span> early trading Monday, a spread <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.42 percentage</span> point above benchmark German debt.</span> The spread <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 0.64 percentage</span> point on Friday.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, the French CAC-40 stock market index <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 3.8% in</span> the early minutes of European trade, driving the broader</span> Stoxx <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Europe 600 up</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.5%.</span> Across Europe, gains in equities were led by banks, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.5%,</span> a sign that investors are again eager to bet on risk.

Many euro traders—and holders of European assets—had been concerned by the prospect of a strong showing by Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, or by the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Ms. Le Pen wants France out of the currency union, and Mr. Mélenchon has advocated scrapping some of its core fiscal rules.</span> Both positions, especially Ms. Le Pen’s, would spell trouble for the euro and for French government bonds.

Mr. Macron won the first round <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 23.9% of</span> the vote, followed by Ms. Le Pen <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 21.4%,</span> according to an official tally <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 96% of</span> the votes, meaning the pair will head into the second round on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 7.</span> Opinion polls published Sunday suggested Mr. Macron would beat Ms. Le Pen.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“This is the most market-friendly outcome,” said Vincent Juvyns, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</span> “A Macron-Le Pen contest in the second round should give Macron a significant majority.”

Conservative François Fillon placed third <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 19.9% of</span> the vote and threw his support behind Mr. Macron. Mr. Mélenchon <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">scored 19.5% of</span> the vote and refused to support one of the top two finishers as of Sunday evening.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Macron’s flagship economic policies are generally friendly to financial markets.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They include corporate tax cuts and an additional €50 billion ($54.5 billion) program of public investment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">During his time as economy minister <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2014 to</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> France put in place the so-called Macron Law to make it easier for employers to lay off workers.

</span>The difference between yields on sovereign bonds issued by France and Germany had widened in recent months ahead of the vote, an indication that traders saw an enhanced—if still tiny—chance that France defaults on its obligations. Other major nations borrow in currencies that they can print; eurozone countries don’t. The tightened spread Monday indicated that traders think that risk has abated.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Elsewhere in market action, gold futures <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">declined 0.9% to</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1276.40 a</span> troy ounce.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.3%.</span>

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Mr. Macron’s leading position may also give some space for the European Central Bank, which has continued with negative interest rates and large bond purchases, to back off those stimulative policies.

</span>Political risks, particularly around the French election, have been a major concern for markets this year. Some analysts and investors believe that the result of the first round may be a trigger for an increased appetite for European assets.

“International investors have been burned a bit in the past few years, so they’ve been reticent to get involved,” said Kevin O’Nolan, portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “But the perception that the center, the establishment is reasserting itself is good for investors.”

Fund managers had already begun to shift toward Europe, with inflows into the region’s equity markets picking up, according to data provider EPFR Global.

“After the Dutch election, we’ve already seen a shift in risk sentiment in terms of the attitude to European equities,” said Monica Defend, head of global asset allocation research at Pioneer Investments. (A mainstream center-right party prevailed over an anti-immigrant firebrand in last month’s Dutch election.)

Investors have been more cautious about the French election following the surprise results of last year’s U.K. referendum on EU membership, and the U.S. presidential election. Sunday’s first round may tamp down some uncertainty.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The most important thing is that it shows the polls are reliable, and that should increase the confidence in the second round results,” said Anais Boussie, economist at Credit Suisse.

</span>“You should see Le Pen defeated by <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 or</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 points</span>—with Brexit and Trump you had a gap of more like five points,” she added.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">France’s latest economic data has exceeded expectations, with business surveys hinting at the fastest expansion in nearly six years.</span> IHS Markit’s purchasing managers index for March <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 57.1</span>; anything <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 50 points</span> to growth.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">“European economic data has been better, stocks are cheaper, and it looked like there could be some sort of relief rally” after the French election, said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.

29585,"<h3>The Problem With Meal Kits</h3>Meal kits promised to make cooking easy enough that people would actually do it. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">But Americans don’t want to cook and never really have

Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 11</span>:29 am ET

The meal-kit market keeps getting bigger: Consumers can now opt for organic meal kits (Sun Basket), Southern meal kits (Peach Dish) and even Tom Brady-inspired vegan meal kits (TB12).</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This summer, Amazon got into the $5-billion-a-year business, offering kits that include all the ingredients you need to make, say, a veggie burger with harissa aioli and smoked eggplant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 30 minutes</span>.</span> So far, the kits are available only in Seattle and only to subscribers to Amazon Fresh, the company’s grocery service. Its slogan: “We do the prep. You be the chef.”

There’s only one problem: Americans don’t want to cook and never really have. Despite the nostalgic halo around home cooking, we have always seen mealtime mostly as a hurdle to clear, not as a cherished tradition. “Americans know the value of time too well to waste it at the table,” noted a visitor from England in a travel journal—<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1794.</span>

One invention after another has been designed to make feeding ourselves faster and easier, from the automated mill to frozen food, the drive-through to the microwave. And once women—who used to do all the cooking—had the opportunity (and the need) to work outside the home, the home-cooked meal was finished, at least as the daily anchor of domestic life.

In surveys, Americans say that they enjoy cooking, but they clearly don’t want to do too much of it. <span id=""2"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 2016,</span> the amount of time that women spent cooking had fallen to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 37 minutes</span> a day, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span> The Hartman Group, a food consulting firm, found that more than half of dinners in the U.S. are planned less than an hour before they are eaten. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst of the market-research firm NPD Group, predicts that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2026 less</span> than half the main dishes served for dinner at home will be made from scratch.

</span>The promise of meal kits was to finally make cooking easy enough that Americans would actually do it. Proponents hoped that a cooking revival also could ease the nation’s obesity crisis—a way to reclaim control of what we eat from the big food manufacturers and restaurant chains.

Early meal-kit entrepreneurs chased affluent, urban consumers who love farmers markets and fantasize about having a backyard chicken coop. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">These customers have disposable time and income and believe that they need to cook—both to be healthy and to distinguish themselves as engaged consumers.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Market leader Blue Apron, for instance, touts its sustainable sourcing and showcases exotic ingredients, like fairy-tale eggplants, in dishes such as quinoa tabbouleh with toasted pine nuts and yogurt sauce.

</span>Still, the amount of cooking required has apparently been too much, even for the farm-to-table crowd. (So much chopping!) <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Industry analysts believe that meal-kit purveyors are having trouble retaining customers, and Blue Apron has seen its stock price slide since its IPO in late June.

</span>The companies are only now starting to acknowledge the truth about the American home cook. Blue Apron recently introduced recipes that are faster to prepare. Amazon and other more recent entrants such as FreshRealm, Gobble and Terra’s Kitchen are going further, dialing back the prep work to almost zero. An Amazon recipe for catfish includes pre-made guacamole, already shucked corn and pre-sliced jalapeños. Tovala, launched in July, requires no cooking at all: The meals arrive prepared in aluminum trays. All you do is scan the bar code on the package, and the custom-made “smart oven” (yours for just $399) will bake, broil or steam it to perfection.

Americans talk a good game about the importance of home cooking and family meals, but we still want convenience above all. To succeed, meal kits won’t just have to be easier than starting from scratch; they will have to be as easy as takeout. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">For Amazon, that might mean tweaking that clever slogan for its meal-kit business: “We do the prep.</span> You pretend to be the chef.”

Federal</span> Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell visits Capitol Hill this week to testify on monetary policy, his first public appearance since being sworn in as the central bank’s new leader.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Powell Sees the Fed Sticking With Its Current Policy Tools
Rep. Jeb Hensarling Puts Down a Marker Ahead of Jerome Powell's Testimony
Some See in Powell Testimony a Reason to be Hawkish on Rates
The Fed's Concern on Cryptocurrencies
A Closer Look at Wage Growth
Markets Shrug Off Jerome Powell's Testimony
Congressman Jeb Hensarling opened the hearing by asking Mr. Powell about whether the Fed is going to stick with using its current interest-rate setting tool, the ability to pay banks interest on their excess reserves.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">This has only been the Fed's principal policy tool in the last couple of years.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The Fed used to control rates through open market operations.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell said that for now the Fed is sticking with interest on excess reserves: ""We have not made a decision in the longer-run whether that will continue to be our framework or if we’ll return to something more like before the crisis,"" he said.</span> ""This is not a near-term decision"" and ""our current approach seems to be working well.<span id=""5"" class=""red"">""
Rep. Jeb Hensarling starts off his statement ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's by marking some territory.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">While he told Mr. Powell, ""We are all rooting for you, because much is at stake,"" he nevertheless said the Fed needs to do a better job communicating its policies.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He also the Fed ""must stay in its lane"" and not undertake monetary policy strategies that are more appropriately done by Congress.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mr. Hensarling also said key aspects of how the Fed manages interest rates now, namely its power to pay banks interest on reserves, are problematic and could compromise the Fed's independence if central bankers stick with this strategy.
</span>Mr. Powell is walking into the room now for his first congressional testimony. We're still probably a bit away from when things get interesting. First, lots of photos, and then opening statements from the House committeee leaders, and then Mr. Powell will read his testimony. (Ms. Yellen used to eat up time in the hearing with a slow verbatim reading of the already-released written testimony; to be fair, many Congress members show up to the hearings having apparently not yet read it.) Typically, the questioning starts <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 20 minutes</span> from now.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Some observers of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today see it as a reason to affirm their hawkish views on monetary policy.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">While Fed officials penciled in three rate rises <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2018 in</span> their most recent forecasts, some now reckon a strong economy, juiced by fiscal policy, could drive the Fed to raise rates four times this year.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell hinted ""at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response,"" said analysts at ING.</span> In light of the strong outlook, ""we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter starting with the <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 21 FOMC</span> meeting,"" the firm said. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Capital Economics is also on board for four hikes and called a March move ""a near-certainty.</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">""
The idea that the Fed will boost its short-term rate target in March is indeed a pretty safe bet.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">In a recent television interview, Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader William Dudley said ""as long as I’m comfortable that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace at a time that I think monetary policy is accommodative and financial conditions are easy, I’m probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation"" at the upcoming meeting.

The writers of Wall Street research notes always love a good classic-rock lyric as a short and sweet way to sum up an issue. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">And so it goes for Jerome Powell's first-ever testimony as Fed chairman.
</span>BMO Capital Markets strategist Ian Lyngen goes straight for The Who in summing up Mr. Powell's testimony: ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<span id=""24"" class=""red"">""
""While we've used that lyrical reference in the past, we think it does a great job summarizing"" what the chairman is slated to say today and the continuity of his views relative to former Fed leader Janet Yellen, Mr. Lyngen wrote.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">For comparison, here's our coverage of the two recent speeches from Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair of supervision: yesterday's speech and last week's speech.</span> Indeed, a lot of similarities.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Markets have largely brushed off the release of Jerome Powell's prewritten testimony, which showed the new Fed chair plans to stick to a gradual path for interest-rate increases.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">The yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed from before the release, recently <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.87%,</span> while the dollar edged <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.1%.</span></span> S&P futures <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slipped 0.2%.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">BMO Capital Markets analysts say the muted market reaction suggests Mr. Powell's testimony is a ""fully priced-in event.</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">""
Still, his Q&A session later this morning will be closely watched by investors for any new clues on how Mr. Powell is thinking about growth, inflation and interest rates.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">One of the big questions about new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today is one of style.</span> The last two central bank leaders, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, were both top-tier academics. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Their style of communication could often skew toward ivory-tower economics, although both of those leaders were models of clarity compared with the deliberately obtuse language of Alan Greenspan.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell isn't an economist, and has a strong background in finance.</span> There's some expectation that Mr. Powell will skew toward shorter and more plain-spoken answers to the questions legislators send his way. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">He's seen as less likely to dive into the technicalities of economic issues.</span> It'll be an interesting test to see whether such a style helps Mr. Powell, should he choose to speak more plainly. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">After all, the Fed does believe its policies are more effective when they are broadly understood.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">Setting Fed interest-rate policy based on rules has become a bit of a flash point between Congress and the Fed.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">A good number of legislators would like to see the central bank make rate policy based on some sort of rule, something most Fed officials have long pushed back against.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">In his first-ever testimony as Fed leader, Jerome Powell told Congress, ""I find these rule prescriptions helpful.""</span> But they're not the whole story: ""Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account,"" he said in his prepared remarks.
For Mr. Powell, that view represents continuity with the his predecessors.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">One more message from his testimony : Mr. Powell doesn't expect the factors weighing down inflation to repeat themselves.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">He will tell lawmakers that he expects inflation to move up this year and stabilize around the Fed’<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% objective</span> “over the medium term,” and that “wages should increase at a faster pace as well.”
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">After running below the Fed’s target for years, recent economic data suggests price pressures are finally starting to firm.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell noted monthly inflation readings were “a little higher” at the end <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017 than</span> earlier months, and said he continues to view the inflation shortfall as “likely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat.”
</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">After years of lackluster wage growth, Americans may soon see faster increases in the size of their paychecks, he said.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">Wages have continued to grow moderately since the middle <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017,</span> “with a modest acceleration in some measures,” though weak productivity growth in recent years has likely damped some of the pickup in wages, he said.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Given the strong economic outlook, Mr. Powell said ""wages should increase at a faster pace as well.”
Mr. Powell sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy in his prepared testimony Tuesday, noting that “some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds.”
</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">In particular, he noted, fiscal policy has become more stimulative, and foreign demand for U.S. exports “is on a firmer trajectory,” providing “considerable” support for the manufacturing sector.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">He said he also expects upbeat sentiment to support continued growth in business investment, and that a strong labor market will bolster household incomes and spending growth.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">“Indeed, the economic outlook remains strong,” he said.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell's testimony is pretty sanguine about the market's recent wobbles, saying: “at this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">""
Fed officials have worried in the past that high and rising equity prices could inflate a new stock-market bubble.</span> <span id=""50"" class=""red"">The return of market volatility could actually ease those concerns somewhat, as could rising yields on government debt, as they make the market look less ""bubbly.</span>""
Mr. Powell's prewritten testimony has been released! <span id=""51"" class=""red"">Here's the key takeaway from our colleague David Harrison:
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress Tuesday the central bank remains on track to gradually raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel amid strengthening growth and inflation.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">“The economic outlook remains strong,” he said.</span> “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.”
<span id=""53"" class=""red"">A new flashpoint in the debate over the Federal Reserve's postcrisis monetary policies was opened up just last week, when a group of leading economists published a paper at a premier economics conference, arguing that the Fed's quantitative easing policies were largely ineffective.
</span><span id=""54"" class=""red"">The original concern that many had with the Fed's large-scale bond-buying , known as QE for short, was that it would spur runaway inflation and weaken the U.S. dollar.</span> Nothing of the sort happened; rather, it's hard to prove that QE did much of anything at all.
<span id=""55"" class=""red"">Although the Fed is clearly in tightening mode right now, it will be interesting to hear if Mr. Powell shares any of this skepticism about one of the Fed's major policies over the past decade.</span> <span id=""56"" class=""red"">Any commentary from Mr. Powell could provide hints about how the Fed would react during the next downturn.

43854,"<h3>Senate Immigration Backers Target Ways to Win Support</h3>As floodwaters finally retreat, officials must contend with tens of thousands unable to return to their homes

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 3</span>:11 pm ET

HOUSTON—Lillian Godfrey has been sleeping on an air mattress on the floor of her friend’s shuttered night club, alongside her daughter and two pool tables, ever since floodwaters swept into her home here last month.

Ms. Godfrey,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 years</span> old, has a federal voucher for a hotel, but hasn’t had any luck finding a room nearby. Her daughter’s cars were lost in the flooding.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “The Lord closes some doors and opens others. He’s going to pull me through this sooner or later.”

As the floodwaters finally retreat across Texas, federal and local officials are now grappling with another vexing problem wrought by Hurricane Harvey: where to house one of the largest populations displaced by a natural disaster in recent years.

Tens of thousands of Texans are still unable to return to their flood-affected homes. Hotel occupancy in the Houston area has surged. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">And disaster recovery officials are scrambling to figure out short-term and permanent housing for those left homeless by the storm—a daunting and costly mission that could take months.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“While the final scope and scale of the housing challenge is still being realized, it is already apparent that this will be one of the largest, most complex efforts ever undertaken,” said Michael Byrne, who is heading up relief efforts in Texas for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

</span>As of Saturday night, more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 66,000 people</span> who fled the storm were staying in hotels paid for with FEMA vouchers, the agency said. <span id=""2"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 46,120 homeowners</span> and renters who were forced to relocate have also gotten approved by FEMA for financial assistance to help them with housing payments.

</span>More <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4,700 people</span> remained in Red Cross shelters across Texas on Saturday night, according to the relief group.

Others, uneasy with the prospect of living elsewhere, have remained in their waterlogged homes. Still others were staying with friends, family or even strangers.

It is still unclear how many people in Texas will lose their homes because of the storm or how many eventually will be able to move back.

According to data culled by the state from cities and counties, an <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 50,712 homes</span> suffered major damage in the storm,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,952 were</span> destroyed <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 76,364 saw</span> minor damage.

According to local officials, at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 130,000 single</span>-family homes in Harris County, which includes Houston, were estimated to have been affected by the rampant flooding here in some way. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2,000 and</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,000 large</span> apartment buildings likely sustained damage, and up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5,000 smaller</span> apartment buildings may have been damaged as well, according to officials.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“In terms of the sheer destruction due to the flooding, this is unprecedented in modern times for Houston,” said Tom McCasland, Houston’s director of housing and community development.

</span>Mr. McCasland said a sweeping effort is under way—involving city workers, volunteers and FEMA—to figure out which homes were still livable and repair them swiftly. The city is also working to locate any available apartment units that could house evacuees. Similar efforts were under way in flood-ravaged communities throughout Texas.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Cities in particular face significant challenges in the wake of disasters such as hurricanes Harvey and Irma because the housing costs in metropolitan areas are higher, there is little empty space for setting up temporary homes such as trailers, and hotel rooms can be scarce, experts said.

</span>For the first full week of September, hotel occupancy in Houston grew <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80.5%,</span> more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 44% higher</span> than the occupancy rate during the same week a year earlier, according to STR Inc., a data company that tracks the hotel industry.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">In Port Arthur, a coastal city of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 55,000,</span> Mayor Derrick Freeman called the housing situation “dire” in the wake of heavy flooding damage.

</span>This past week, one shelter at a middle school was full after the city’s main shelter had flooded weeks earlier, and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 250 people</span> had been evicted from their homes by landlords because of flood damage, according to Mr. Freeman.

Another several hundred were being housed at shelters around the state, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 4,000 and</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5,000 people</span> were still living in flood-damaged homes, Mr. Freeman said.

He had initially hoped to <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 600 people</span> temporarily housed on two barges that a private company was going to transport from nearby Louisiana.

But, by Friday, the plans had shifted, and large air-conditioned tents were brought in by FEMA and the state to house the evacuees who had been sheltering at the school, he said.

“There are folks here who are really in survival mode,” said Mr. Freeman, whose own home was swamped with water and has been living with his wife and four children at his mother’s home.

Debby Valsin, a 54-year-old retiree, had been living at the middle school shelter in Port Arthur with her nine-year-old grandson. She said her landlord terminated her lease after the floods because her apartment was uninhabitable, giving her five days to haul out her belongings.

Ms. Valsin qualifies for a FEMA hotel voucher but said all the nearby hotels she called are full. For now, with the start of school Monday, Ms. Valsin expected to be moved from the shelter into the tents.

“Your life is upside down,” she said. “I don’t have anything to start over.”

The latest: Trump confirms NRA meeting appearance Friday, when group will lay out midterm strategyReturn to menu
Former president Donald Trump said Wednesday that he plans to headline a forum at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting this Friday, during which the organization will lay out its strategy for this year’s midterm elections.
The gathering will be held in Houston — about a four-hour drive from Uvalde, Tex., where a gunman killed at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 children</span> and two teachers Tuesday.
In a post shared on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said he will keep his “longtime commitment to speak in Texas at the NRA Convention and deliver an important address to America.”
“America needs real solutions and real leadership in this moment, not politicians and partisanship,” Trump said.
His speech Friday will be preceded by a meeting in which the NRA will lay out its strategy for this year’s midterm elections. The association’s political staff will give an update to members on its plan for “the midterm election fight ahead to protect our rights.”
While the NRA’s influence in Washington has diminished amid a bankruptcy trial — the organization <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $11 million</span> in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 midterm</span> races, far less than what it spent <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 </span>— the association has continued spending to oppose Biden’s gun-control agenda.
The annual forum is also slated to include Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem — both Republicans who face reelection races in November.
Trump’s speech will be open to all NRA members — but they can’t bring firearms or firearm accessories into the room, the organization warned.
Take a look: Walker ad seeks to debunk Warnock claim that he’ll work with both partiesReturn to menu
Hershel Walker, the former football star who is now the Republican Senate nominee in Georgia, is out with his first general-election ad — and it’s all about his Democratic opponent, Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.). The ad, in which Walker does not appear, seeks to debunk a Warnock claim that he’s willing to work with both Democrats and Republicans.
The 30-second spot portends a largely negative general-election campaign. Earlier Wednesday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee distributed background materials to reporters that the organization said demonstrate “outright lies and a long trail of dishonest, fraudulent schemes” from Walker.

Analysis: Just how bad was Perdue’s loss in Georgia?Return to menu
Former U.S. senator David Perdue lost Georgia’s Republican primary for governor to incumbent Brian Kemp by a <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">stunning 52 points</span>.
Just how bad is that? The Post’s Aaron Blake offers an assessment:
The scale of that loss shouldn’t be undersold. This is a recent former statewide officeholder — one <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whose 2014 outsider</span> Senate campaign was viewed as something of a model for the party. … While Perdue’s failed comeback is surely among the worst in recent history, losing such a bid is hardly without precedent.Just earlier this month, former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) attempted one in the state’s open Senate race after losing reelection <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span> He lost to Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) by more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 points</span>, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taking 25 percent</span> of the vote.In Nevada, former senator Dean Heller (R), who lost reelection <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span> is running for governor. It looks as though he, too, won’t win his party’s nomination; he trails by double digits in early polls, the most recent of which pegged him at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 11 percent</span> of the vote. (The primary is in three weeks.)
Aaron notes, though, that it’s difficult to find other comeback candidates who fared so poorly in their party’s primaries in recent years. And it’s more common for comeback candidates to lose general elections rather than primaries.

The latest: Still no call in a tight Texas congressional raceReturn to menu
The congressional primary runoff in South Texas pitting Rep. Henry Cuellar against immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros remains uncalled Wednesday morning with <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 175 votes</span> separating the two Democratic contenders and ballots remaining to be tallied.
The lack of a call by the Associated Press did not deter Cuellar from issuing a statement claiming victory early Wednesday morning.
“The results are in, all the votes have been tallied,” Cuellar said in a statement, even though the AP totals <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">showed 2 percent</span> of the vote still outstanding.
Cuellar congratulated Cisneros on a “hard-fought” race and thanked, among others, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), who traveled to Texas late in the campaign for appearances on the trail with him.
The race has been closely watched in part because of Cuellar’s opposition to abortion rights.
Analysis: What a Trump endorsement is worthReturn to menu
In Tuesday’s primaries in Georgia, David Perdue, the candidate Trump endorsed for governor, netted <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 21 percent</span> of the vote, while Rep. Jody Hice, the candidate Trump endorsed for secretary of state, <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">attracted 33 percent</span>.
In assessing how Trump-backed candidates have fared elsewhere, The Post’s Aaron Blake writes:
While Perdue is now the low water mark for Trump-backed candidates, Hice’s showing aligns with the others. Nebraska governor candidate Charles Herbster:<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 percent</span>. Idaho gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov.

Rep. Ted Budd did <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 59 percent</span> in the North Carolina Senate race, and Rep. Alex Mooney (W.Va.) also garnered a majority in an incumbent-vs.-incumbent House primary.

Take a look: Georgia losses ding Trump’s win rate with non-incumbentsReturn to menu
The large majority of candidates endorsed by former president Donald Trump are incumbents and have won their primaries so far.
His success rate with non-incumbents is not as good, dropping <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 70 percent</span> after several lost on Tuesday in Georgia.
The Post’s Youjin Shin, Courtney Beesch and Anu Narayanswamy have an ongoing tally of Trump’s endorsed candidates and how they are doing. They write:
Overall, Trump’s endorsements for state-level offices such as governor and secretary of state are his most clear effort to punish officials he wrongly believes delivered <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> to Joe Biden. His endorsement of a candidate is most often tied to their efforts to confirm election fraud in states he continues to falsely claim were stolen from him.That was especially so in Georgia. Trump had thrown his support behind former senator David Perdue, who lost, claiming incumbent governor Brian Kemp, “allowed massive Election Fraud to take place.” Trump also failed to back winners in statewide secretary of state, attorney general and insurance commissioner races.

Noted: In Ga., Rep. McBath’s victory celebration turns somberReturn to menu
Instead of delivering a joyous victory speech Tuesday night, Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) found herself reliving the pain of losing her teenage son a decade ago to gun violence and yet again mourning the murder of even more children, while forcefully criticizing senators for refusing to take up gun-control legislation that recently passed in the House.
The Post’s Marianna Sotomayor and Mark Shavin report that for those gathered in a hotel ballroom near Atlanta to celebrate McBath’s decisive primary win over Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.), the upbeat party turned into a vigil of sorts when McBath spoke of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 19 children</span> and two teachers killed earlier in the day at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex. They write:
Combating gun violence is the reason McBath says she got into politics — but in her two terms in Congress, little has been accomplished, and mass shootings continue.“Across the country, from Uvalde to Sandy Hook, from Charleston to Buffalo, the violence that took my son is being replayed with casual callousness and despicable frequency,” she said, naming just a few of the mass shootings that have occurred since her son was killed. “We are better than this. We have to be better than this.”
McBath’s 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was killed <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 after</span> he was confronted by Michael Dunn, a White man, for playing loud music in his parked car at a Jacksonville, Fla., gas station. Dunn, who said he felt threatened, fired several shots into the car, killing Davis. He was convicted of first-degree murder two years later and sentenced to life without parole.
After her son’s death, McBath became a fierce gun-control activist.

On our radar: Trump plans vendetta tour stop against Cheney in WyomingReturn to menu
Former president Donald Trump, who failed Tuesday to knock off several Republican candidates in Georgia, plans to head to Wyoming on Saturday to campaign in another race driven by a vendetta.
Trump is seeking to defeat Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who voted for his impeachment on the charge of incitement of an insurrection and now serves as vice chair of the House select committee investigating what transpired at the Capitol on Jan.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span></span><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021.</span>
Trump has planned a fundraiser and a “Save America Rally” on Saturday afternoon in Casper to benefit Harriet Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member who is challenging Cheney.
Cheney has appeared undeterred by the challenge.
She issued a plea Sunday for Americans to stand up in a bipartisan fashion to the actions of Trump, who she said is the only U.S. president who did not live up to a “sacred obligation to defend the peaceful transfer of power.”
Cheney’s comment came after she accepted a Profile In Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation for seeking to hold Trump accountable in the wake of the insurrection, despite retaliatory actions from members of her own party.
Noted: A Trump-backed candidate for attorney general also lost in GeorgiaReturn to menu
Georgia state Attorney General Chris Carr (R) easily prevailed on Tuesday against John Gordon, a GOP primary challenger backed by former president Donald Trump who campaigned on Trump’s baseless allegations of widespread election fraud.
Trump-backed candidates also lost in the state’s GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state, both by sizable margins, as well, and in the race for insurance commissioner.
Carr was <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leading 74 percent</span></span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 26 percent</span>, <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 95 percent</span> of the votes tallied.

Gordon had called for an investigation into <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span>, while Carr said there was no need to investigate the losses of Trump and Georgia’s two GOP Senate candidates.
In November, Carr will face Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan. She also easily prevailed in her Democratic primary on Tuesday.
Analysis: In some ways, Raffensperger’s victory was the biggest surpriseReturn to menu
In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) was expected to prevail over challenger David Perdue, the former U.S. senator who was recruited to run by former president Donald Trump. The race turned into a rout. Kemp was <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leading 74 percent</span></span> <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 22 percent</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 96 percent</span> of the votes tallied.
In some ways, however, Tuesday’s biggest surprise in Georgia was Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who had been left for political dead after more directly repudiating Trump’s false voter-fraud claims, The Post’s Aaron Blake says.
Aaron writes:
Raffensperger, unlike many Republicans who denounce Trump, actually ran for reelection. He got a high-profile, election-truther opponent in Rep. Jody Hice. And it looks like he just might survive after all.Raffensperger led <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Hice 52 percent</span> <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 33 percent</span> with <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 96 percent</span> of the vote in, narrowly avoiding a runoff with Hice. (He <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needs 50 percent</span> plus one.) A runoff would have proved difficult, with potentially lower turnout.

On our radar: Kemp’s victory sets up rematch with Abrams in NovemberReturn to menu
Tuesday’s GOP primary victory by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) sets up a rematch in November with Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state House minority leader and voting-rights activist who was unopposed on the Democratic side.
Abrams, who narrowly lost to Kemp <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span></span> is vying to become the first Black female governor in the country.
Kemp won on Tuesday against former U.S. senator David Perdue, who was recruited to challenge Kemp by former president Donald Trump, who was angry that Kemp didn’t do more to overturn <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> election results in the state. Throughout the race, Perdue echoed Trump’s baseless claims of widespread election fraud.
During remarks to supporters on Tuesday night, Kemp didn’t mention Trump by name but instead bragged about his record of reopening Georgia during the pandemic and attacked Abrams.
“Georgia would be just one variant away from lockdowns, government mandates, schools shuttered and businesses closed,” he said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Abrams has campaigned on a pledge to expand Medicaid to all adults in the state and, even before Tuesday’s results, been highly critical of Kemp’s leadership, including his claim that Georgia had become the best state in which to do business.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I am tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live,” Abrams said over the weekend.</span> “Let me contextualize. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">When you’re No.<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48 for</span> mental health, when you’re No.<span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 for</span> maternal mortality, when you have an incarceration rate that’s on the rise and wages that are on the decline, then you are not the No.<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 place</span> to live.”</span>"
45383,"<h3>Tech billionaires have turned Halloween into a circus</h3>PALO ALTO, Calif. — There are certain predictable outcomes when you live in a neighborhood with a bunch of billionaires. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The real estate prices have gone up, of course.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Prices in nice restaurants have doubled, too.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">But Palo Alto resident Bill Glazier did not expect to lose trick-or-treaters to the annual Halloween production staged outside the home of his neighbor, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The Jobs used to give out this organic chocolate that nobody really likes.</span> It’s not like they’re handing out iPhones,” Glazier says. “People go because they want to see the show.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The show on Thursday night, put on by Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs, who was married to Steve Jobs, was a series of professional-grade set pieces featuring a lighthouse, a metal shop and a lunch counter.</span> It involved actors and props and lighting and stagehands, some of whom handed out bags of gourmet candy at the end of the display. The zombie cheerleader, zombie gym teacher, zombie lunch person and zombie friends zombie-danced to pop hits like Beyoncé and “Whip It.”
The show required permits from the city of Palo Alto for noise exemption, special events and road closure to shut down traffic for six blocks. In recent years, the show attracted <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 3,000 people</span>, according to a spokesperson for the Palo Alto police.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The tradition started with the former Apple CEO, a Halloween aficionado, who famously dressed up as Jesus Christ for Apple’s first Halloween party <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1979,</span> “an act of semi-ironic self-awareness that he considered funny but that caused a lot of eye rolling,” Walter Isaacson wrote in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 biography</span> “Steve Jobs.”</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">In addition to the organic chocolate, the Jobs house also used to hand out boxes of carrot juice, a favorite beverage of Steve Jobs, the inveterate health nut and vegetarian, according to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2005 book</span> “iCon Steve Jobs.”
</span>But more recently, much like the tech industry itself, the Halloween festivities have rapidly scaled from an organic attempt at connection into something unrecognizable. In Palo Alto, the suburban home to some of the richest billionaires on the planet, lines form hours before the show starts and curve around two blocks.
At times, the setup felt like a suburban Burning Man, the annual “commerce-free” desert festival where Bay Area techies, who might otherwise not interact with people outside their social circle, build elaborate stages and structures and delight in the communal ritual of gifting other Burners with free things — reveling in the freedom and safety of bounded generosity. Like Burning Man, the Palo Alto displays are ephemeral, often going up Halloween morning and <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vanishing 24 hours</span> later.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">[The Quest of Laurene Powell Jobs]
In recent years, flashy new entrants have joined the race.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo and employee No.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 at</span> Google, waged her own competing Halloween bonanza in nearby Professorville on Thursday night.</span> Trick-or-treaters lined up for a stupefying selection of movie-size candy: bags of Haribo Goldbears and Sour Patch Kids, full bars of Nestle Crunch, and boxes of Hot Tamales, Jujyfruits, Goobers, Milk Duds and Nerds. Plush stuffed animals — swans, zebras, sloths, elephants, pink giraffes, narwhals with sequins — were constantly restocked by a handful of adults behind the scenes. Kids were allowed to grab one candy and one toy, according to the adult restocking bars of Toblerone. The density and decadence were dizzying, at any age.
“Palo Alto is so spirited at Halloween — I just love it!” Mayer said in a statement. “Trick-or-treating in Professorville is a fun activity that really brings the neighborhood together.”
One of Mayer’s neighbors, Kim Blanding, who works in product marketing at Facebook and who brought her three boys to trick-or-treat at Mayer’s house, was dressed in all black with red lipstick as disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, a costume she chose because Theranos was “the epitome of Silicon Valley and VC demise,” Blanding said. “It’s such a chauvinistic world and yet this woman was able to capture it, but she was a fraud.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">A mile away in Old Palo Alto, in the empty lot across the street from the Jobs house, Yasmin Lukatz, the stepdaughter of billionaire casino magnate and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, threw a carnival-themed show.</span> Circus performers took turns on a makeshift stage near a blowup funhouse maze, while a witch perched on a tall bendy pole and bobbed in the air.
“It feels like because of where it is, you have to be part of the party,” said Lukatz, who bought the property that was listed <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $11.4 million</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>
An invite-only section of Lukatz’s carnival had banners for ICON, or the Israel Collaboration Network, a group founded by Lukatz to connect tech communities in Silicon Valley and Israel.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">In past years, the show outside Google co-founder Larry Page’s house,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 500 feet</span> away from Powell Jobs’s Tudor mansion, has been epic, as repeat visitors will attest.</span> There was the UFO theme and the carnival theme. Dennis, a Palo Alto resident who works in fire protection and who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used, said the best year was the Gotham show a few years ago. “It looked like some Disney Hollywood people came up and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1 million</span>,” he said.
But this year, there was only a table with Christmas lights and plastic cauldrons filled with normal fun-size candy. Andy, who also spoke on the condition that only his first name be used and who works in logistics for one of the families on Page’s private cul-de-sac, said the families were “calming things down” this year and have been very busy, so decided to keep it low-key.
Some regular visitors were disappointed, peering past the rotating cast of women in costume handing out candy to make sure they didn’t miss anything. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But across the street, the party went on, with a nine-person band blasting Motown classics and the fog machine next door at the Jobs house beckoning.
</span>Meghan Horrigan-Taylor, chief communications officer for the city of Palo Alto, said the “neighbors reimburse the city for city-related costs.” <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But Old Palo Alto resident Lynn Brown, who lives down the block from Jobs, told The Washington Post she doesn’t have to chip in because the “nice neighbors” foot the bill, which she believes means it’s taken care of by Powell Jobs and Page.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Powell Jobs declined to answer questions through a spokesperson for Emerson Collective.</span> Page did not respond to questions.
Longtime residents may miss the old days, but the event has expanded far beyond them, judging by the crowds Thursday night. Particularly in the early hours, they were mostly multigenerational East Asian families who came from Mountain View, San Jose, Fremont, Milpitas or just a few blocks away in other Palo Alto neighborhoods to see the show and to let their kids trick-or-treat safely on closed-off streets. They spoke Mandarin and Hindi and Japanese and Turkish, code-switching to English to answer questions from The Post.
According <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2017 estimates</span> from the American Community Survey, Palo Alto <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 75.8 percent</span> white,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.3 percent</span> Asian, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.2 percent</span> black, a similar demographic breakdown to most tech companies.
Practical information about the Old Palo Alto Halloween event spreads by word of mouth, social media and private messaging apps. Kiki Wei, a Taiwanese event planner from Newark, Calif., organized a group by sending messages on the Korean messaging app Line and WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg owns four homes a five-minute drive away. Wei first heard about the event years ago from a friend’s Facebook, which did not specify the exact location. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“You need to Google ‘Steven Jobs address,’ ” she said.

40013,"<h3>Steep Oil and Strong Dollar Make Toxic Brew for Global Economies</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">For Americans, rising oil prices are threatening $3-a-gallon gasoline and pushing up prices for plane tickets.</span> In many other parts of the world, today’s crude rally is more painful—sparking protests, gas lines and emergency subsidies to quell unrest.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">That is because many consumers outside the U.S. face a double whammy when—like now—the dollar gets stronger at the same time that oil prices rise.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While petroleum is produced all over the globe, when it is sold to refiners and other buyers it is almost always priced in dollars.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">It is, in the words of Brazilian Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia, “a challenging external scenario.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">After Brazil’s military brought an end to a crippling strike by truck drivers over high fuel prices, Mr. Guardia called the oil rally “brutal” for his country.
</span>Brazil is among the handful of oil-dependent countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia that have turned to costly fuel subsidies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Across swaths of Africa, higher fuel costs and weakening local currencies have hit prices for food and electronics.
</span>Fast-rising crude, on its own, has been pressuring global growth for months. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Swiss bank UBS figures that today’s international crude price, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $75 a</span> barrel, would boost global inflation by more than half a percentage point, compared with <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $50 barrels</span> the world enjoyed as recently as last year.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Brent crude, the international benchmark, has eased off a recent 3½-year high of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $80,</span> on expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will boost output when it meets this week.</span> Before that retreat, oil was up more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20% this</span> year.
There are global winners, along with losers. The U.S., squeezed over the decades in past oil rallies, is looking pretty comfortable this time. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">In recent years, America has boosted production significantly, making it much less dependent on imports.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Overall economic growth in big crude producers like the U.S. and Canada could rise by almost a third of a percentage point with today’s prices, says UBS.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">In import-heavy economies like China and the eurozone, however, growth could slip a tenth of a percentage point, UBS figures.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">That may not sound like a significant hit overall, but fuel prices can be particularly painful for specific swaths of any economy.</span> This month, Chinese truckers refused to move goods and blocked roads in a handful of cities, protesting higher fuel costs.
Exacerbating the pain in many countries is a strengthening dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar compared with a basket <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 16 major</span> currencies, has <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">strengthened 6% since</span> February.
In Europe, dollar strength against the euro has helped make crude today <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30% more</span> expensive than when oil was at a low in February.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">For European consumers, gasoline-price shocks are often dampened by the continent’s generally steep taxes on the fuel.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That makes the cost of oil a smaller percentage of the overall price of a liter of gas.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">This year’s price increase, though, has been so steep that many drivers are feeling the squeeze.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices in Britain rose faster in May than in any month on record, according to RAC, a drivers’ lobby group, which called it a “hellish month.”</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A lower pound against the dollar and higher oil prices were a “toxic combination,” an RAC spokesman said.
</span>“I fill up two or three times a week. I feel it,” said Cristinel Bulai, an Uber driver in London. “When, in one year, every month you see a little bit more, you say, ‘whoa, whoa.’<span id=""17"" class=""red"">”
Brent crude is still well below the $100-plus a barrel it fetched <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2011 through</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> and prices probably aren’t high enough to knock the European economy from its recent upward trajectory.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Still, the oil and dollar rally act like a tax, limiting consumers’ discretionary spending.</span> That threatens a pullback in consumption that can eventually hit growth. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">It can also feed into inflation and pressure central banks to boost borrowing rates.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Inflation in Spain jumped to an <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">annualized 2.2% last</span> year from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minus 0.2% in</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> largely due to higher energy prices.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The pain has been greatest in economies where dollar strength has been even more pronounced.</span> In Brazil, gasoline is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 28% and</span> diesel fuel for trucks more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 27% over</span> the past year. The Brazilian real has <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 11% this</span> year against the dollar.
The two-week strike by Brazilian truckers stranded goods across the country, triggering warnings about possible shortages from grocery stores, hospitals and McDonald’s outlets. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">To end the walkout, President Michel Temer rolled out the military and promised <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">truckers $3 billion</span> in diesel-fuel subsides and tax cuts.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Brazil’s government has restricted how often fuel suppliers can raise prices, at once a month.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">As energy prices rose, economists polled by the central bank slashed a full percentage point of growth off Brazil’s forecast output this year, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%.</span>
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">In Indonesia, where the rupiah has fallen to its weakest level against the dollar in more than two years, fuel prices are an election issue.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">President Joko Widodo has promised not to raise prices of subsidized fuels and electricity <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">through 2019,</span> when he is expected to run for a second term.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In April, he required fuel retailers, including foreign firms Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA, to seek government approval before raising prices they charge at the pump.
</span>Jakarta also said it would dramatically increase diesel subsidies. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Thailand and Malaysia—where newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed made it a campaign pledge—have both ramped up spending to stabilize pump prices.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">“Governments are promising to cap fuel prices to win votes and elections,” said Hak Bin Chua, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng in Singapore.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">While Africa is a big oil producer, much of the continent is energy-poor and dependent on imports—and several governments are also contending with pressure on their currencies.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">In Nigeria, the continent’s biggest crude exporter, a government cap on what drivers pay at the pump has led to gasoline shortages as retailers struggle to pay for refined fuel imports.

65566,"<h3>Covid Live Updates: Chicago Cancels Classes After Teachers Resist Returning to School</h3>Covid Live Updates: Chicago Cancels Classes After Teachers Resist Returning to School
Chicago Public Schools officials canceled classes on Wednesday after the teachers’ union criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, saying classroom conditions were unsafe.
Public school officials in Chicago canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers’ union, whose members had threatened to stay home in a bid to force instruction online during a coronavirus surge.
Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 73 percent</span> of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction.
But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction.
“Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.”
Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage.
As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away.
Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute.</span> The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability.
Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes.
In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">More <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 90 percent</span> of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated.
</span>Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning.
“We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.”

President Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism on Wednesday after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure to rein in the coronavirus pandemic ahead of a key presidential election.
“I really want to piss off the unvaccinated,” Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien. “And so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.”
Mr. Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France’<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 67 million</span> people are fully vaccinated, but roughly five million French people have not received a single shot.
“I’m not going to put them in prison,” he said. “I’m not going to vaccinate them by force.”
Instead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France’s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.
Once the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination — or, in some cases, of recovery from Covid-19 — will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.
France has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 270,000 for</span> Tuesday alone — and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.
Mr. Macron has consistently made it clear that his government’s strategy was to make life for unvaccinated French people uncomfortable. But his comments, which were published late Tuesday on the newspaper’s website, marked the first time he stated so in such a crude way, even as the rapid surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is already fraying France’s social contract on Covid.
Mr. Macron’s comments quickly caused an uproar in Parliament, interrupting a session where lawmakers were debating the government’s vaccination bill. Reaction from his political opposition was swift.
Christian Jacob, the head of the right-wing Republicans party, told lawmakers that the comments were unbecoming of a French head of state. “I cannot support a bill whose only goal is to piss off the French,” he said.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron’s main opponents in the upcoming election, accused him of “waging war” on the unvaccinated.
“Even if one doesn’t share their choice, they have broken none of our country’s laws,” she told reporters in Parliament late Tuesday, saying Mr. Macron had made a political and moral mistake. “He is continuing his policy of division, of pitting the French against one another,” she added.
Mr. Macron’s comments come in a heated political climate — less than four months before the presidential election — and after he vowed in a recent interview that he had learned from mistakes made earlier in his term, when his one-liners were regularly criticized as dismissive and out of touch.
The president’s opponents have maneuvered in Parliament to delay the passing of the vaccination bill, and his supporters have reported receiving death threats and insults because they are backing the legislation. One lawmaker’s home garage was the target of arson and hostile graffiti last month.
Stéphane Séjourné, a member of the European Parliament and close ally of Mr. Macron’s, defended the president’s comments, arguing on Twitter that it was the unvaccinated who were bothering the French by overburdening hospitals, exhausting health workers and “forcing the rest of the population to endure restrictions.”
“So yes, we have to piss them off in return,” he said.
The news that Novak Djokovic had received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament this month in Melbourne spurred a range of reactions in Australia, where some politicians and tennis officials called on him to explain himself.
Djokovic, the world’s No.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 male</span> tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was “heading Down Under with an exemption permission.”
The tournament’s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated.
Reaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, “If he’s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.”
“That’s very politically correct of you,” de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, “I just think it’s just very interesting; that’s all I’m going to say.”
Other Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated.
Stephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.”
Another Twitter user called it “a slap in the face of millions of Australians.”
Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated, I wouldn’t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.”
Djokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine — he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water — and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic’s father referred to the mandate as “blackmail.”
Jacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament.
“It’s the government’s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what’s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,” she said on Wednesday at a news conference.
Craig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people “will be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,” but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors.
Left unanswered was whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they “will need to provide proof” to airline staff.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide “acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.”
“If that evidence is insufficient,” Morrison said, “he won’t be treated different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home.”
Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to control an incipient Omicron outbreak.
The new measures will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions from the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of Omicron threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic.
“Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new rules.
A day earlier, Mrs. Lam had said that no new social-distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.
“We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron, a highly transmissible variant.”
The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already has one of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, flights will be temporarily banned from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and United States for two weeks starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from traveling by other routes.
Large public events will be canceled, and several public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visits to hospitals and nursing homes will also be banned for two weeks. Dining in restaurants will be banned <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 p</span>.m. But the government decided not to stop in-person teaching or require government officials to work from home.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Hong Kong has had a growing number of imported cases of the Omicron variant, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 133 as</span> of Tuesday.
</span>“If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health.
The Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec.<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> infecting his father and at least one other person.
Mrs. Lam said the measures were most likely “the most decisive, rapid, targeted and comprehensive for the past two years so that we can cut the transmission chains as soon as possible.”
The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient.
Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 had</span> come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The people were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative.

A woman in Georgia who fraudulently obtained more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $6 million</span> in Covid relief money was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $2.2 billion</span> Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2020.</span>
</span>In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $7.9 million</span> on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span> whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2016,</span> lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said.</span> Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight.
The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $2.1 million</span> of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $6 million</span> that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $1.6 million</span>.
The giant loan program, which ran intermittently from <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2020 to</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2021,</span> relied on banks and other lenders. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans.
</span>The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $76 billion</span> of <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its $800 billion</span> in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $38 billion</span>.)
The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 150 defendants</span> so far and seized more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $75 million</span> in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items.
Last month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J. Bellamy, was sentenced <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 37 months</span> in prison after he fraudulently obtained more <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.2 million</span> through the Paycheck Protection Program for a company that he owned.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had spent more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $100,000 of</span> the funds on luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other brands. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread.
The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov.<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.</span> Only <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 samples</span> have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December.
Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months.
“That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said.
By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> has more <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 120,000 sequences</span> in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 128 countries</span>, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world.
Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">contained 46 mutations</span> that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible.
According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 12 cases</span> in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it.
“It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">these 12 cases</span>,” researchers wrote.
Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant.
Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.”

After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 2,200 exhibitors</span> set to show up in person.
</span>But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.
It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</span> (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $291 million</span> from spending tied to it <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span>) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.
But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.
Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month’s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.
</span>So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained.
“We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,” Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, “We can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.”
The prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called “Plan B,” which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.
“I do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,” Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a “good chance” of getting through the wave without further restrictions.
As Mr. Johnson’s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 218,000 new</span> coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.
Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.
Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">identified 100,000 critical</span> workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.
Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England’s National Health Service moved to a “war footing,” the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.
Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.
England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 88 percent</span> protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.
Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak “may possibly have plateaued.”
Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said.
“Hospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,” Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year.
The International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 11 workers</span> at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals.
All of the infected workers — eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec.<span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 flight</span> — were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country’s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.)
The outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica;<span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 36 people</span> stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2020.</span> But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations.
There are <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 30 people</span> stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 miles</span> south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting “remote field work,” according to the foundation.
Some news outlets have reported <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 16 people</span> tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had “suspended” flights to and from the station until Jan.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span></span> saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec.<span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 and</span> Jan.<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 in</span> the first place.
“The management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan.<span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span></span>” the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. “However, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan.<span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 as</span> planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.”
Workers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 72 hours</span> of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span> of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station.
According to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec.<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span> and all members tested negative on Dec.<span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14.</span>
The first infection was detected on Dec.<span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15.</span> The foundation said medical staff had “isolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others” — leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk. An infected person can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms."
89586,"<h3>Trump and Johnson’s Complex ‘Bromance’ Is Underscored by Pence Visit</h3>LONDON — Battered by serial defeats in Parliament, scolded by members of his own party, abandoned by even his own brother, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain looked this week like someone who could use a friend.

These days, however, Mr. Johnson does not look like much of a winner. He suffered back-to-back defeats in Parliament on his call for an election and his vow to withdraw from the European Union, with or without a deal, by Oct.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31.</span> <span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Thursday, his own brother, Jo Johnson, resigned from Parliament and the government, saying he was “torn between family loyalty and the national interest.”
</span>Friendship with Mr. Trump is also a fickle thing. He was friendly with President Emmanuel Macron of France until the two men fell out over Iran and climate change, among other issues. Mr. Johnson, as foreign secretary under Prime Minister Theresa May, unsuccessfully lobbied the White House not to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Mr. Trump dangled again, via Mr. Pence, the prospect of a profitable trade agreement with the United States.
</span>“He told me this morning,” Mr. Pence said. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He said, ‘You tell my friend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that we’re ready to go to work on that free trade agreement just as soon as you’re ready.’”
Mr. Johnson appeared gratified — “fantastic,” he interjected at one point — but also wary of a bearhug from a leader who remains deeply unpopular in Britain.</span> The meeting, which could have been an anodyne display of support, instead captured the complexities of Mr. Johnson’s “bromance” with Mr. Trump.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While Mr. Johnson welcomed Mr. Pence’s promise of trade talks, he said, “You guys are pretty tough negotiators, so we are going to work very hard to make sure that the free trade deal is one that works for all sides.”
</span>Critics of Mr. Johnson say that a post-Brexit Britain, particularly if it leaves without a deal, would be so heavily dependent on the United States that Mr. Trump would be able extract punitive terms in any negotiation.
Under Mr. Johnson, these people say, Britain’s prized public health system would be pried open by American insurance and pharmaceutical companies, while the United States would force British shoppers to buy chlorine-washed poultry that falls below European standards.
“We’re not too keen on that chlorinated chicken,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own here on the opposition bench.”
His reference was to Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, whom Mr. Johnson referred to as a “chlorinated chicken” during a debate in Parliament on Wednesday after he challenged Mr. Corbyn to back a snap election.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">During Mr. Trump’s visit in June, he first signaled that everything would be on the table in a trade negotiation.</span> But he later walked back his words under intense pressure from his British hosts, excluding the health care system.
On Thursday, Mr. Johnson took pains to reiterate that “the National Health Service is not on the table.” <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He also reminded Mr. Pence of American trade barriers against British agriculture and other exports.
</span>“The people of the United States of America don’t eat any British lamb or beef — or haggis from Scotland,” the prime minister said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“There are still barriers to trade in shower trays, if you can believe it, from the U.K.”
</span>For Mr. Johnson, the politics of his relationship with Mr. Trump have always been tricky. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mr. Johnson has played up his ties to reassure voters that if Britain leaves the European Union, he would be well-placed to hammer out a trade agreement with his friend in the White House.
</span>For his part, Mr. Trump has been steadfast in his support of Mr. Johnson’s aggressive approach to the Brexit negotiations, including his threat to leave without a deal. Mr. Pence has echoed that position.
If Mr. Johnson finds himself, in a few weeks, locked in an election against a Labour Party eager to paint him as a lackey of Washington, analysts say he may have to distance himself from what Mr. Pence celebrated as “the very warm and personal relationship you have forged with President Trump.”
Until now, Mr. Johnson has taken a studiously respectful tone with the president. It is hard to imagine him joking with Mr. Trump about “chlorinated chicken” the way he did with Mr. Pence. In their meeting on Thursday, Mr. Pence stuck to a script, as he usually does, while Mr. Johnson joked, interrupted his guest and spoke casually — playing a role almost like that of Mr. Trump."

We'll be around for the next hour with analysis from our team and market reaction.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The reaction so far: Investors liked the latest Fed decision, just as they have liked many Fed decisions for the past seven years.
</span>For posterity:
That's all from Ms. Yellen. She was out before the cameras for just under an hour. No big fireworks, no political trouble from her answers but plenty of room for her colleagues to battle out this divide in public for the next three months. Good luck to all of us.
Today's final question is on the issue of worker paychecks.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Already, Ms. Yellen said, there’s been “some modest pickup in wage growth,” and last week’s Census Bureau report on U.S. household income was “encouraging.”</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Going forward, she said, as the labor market continues to improve, there should be further acceleration in wages.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Milton Friedman once said monetary policy operates with long and variable lags.</span> Has that changed?
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The short answer: No. Ms. Yellen says the Fed still needs to operate based on forecasts.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">She does not support the notion that officials should take a whites-of-their-eyes approach to inflation (i.e., waiting until it's clearly in front of you).
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">But the global economy's structure changes and the nature of inflation changes.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">So times change, she says, but the forward-looking nature of monetary policy still matters.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Should private bankers continue to sit on the boards of the regional Fed banks?</span> Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called getting rid of that arrangement a no-brainer.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen said that “very strong measures” are in place to prevent conflicts of interest when it comes to the Fed's bank-supervision activities.
</span>In the end, she said, “it’s up to Congress to decide what to do here.” But she added a cautionary note that lawmakers should carefully think through the ramifications of any changes.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">How on earth will the Fed raise rates by two and a half percentage points with growth so low and not generating much inflation?
</span>The answer isn't all that pleasant. ""I agree the projections for growth are slow,"" Ms. Yellen says.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">The Fed has written down its estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate and the longer-run normal level of interest rates.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Part of the reason: Productivity growth is low and will stay low.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">But but but (yes, there's a but) Ms. Yellen says inflation—wage and price growth—is driven by tightness in the labor market.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">We are still getting a healthy pace of job-market growth with very slow economic growth.
</span>That explains the downward shift in the neutral federal-funds rate. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">In the end, the concern is about slow productivity growth because it means slow growth in living standards.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">When banks harm consumers, it's not just a consumer-protection issue.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">""One of the lessons from the financial crisis is that abuses of consumers that we saw in subprime lending ultimately did become safety and soundness issues,"" Ms. Yellen said.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Left unsaid, of course: not only did these abuses of last decade help cripple the banks, they brought down the broader economy too.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 just</span> hit a new high for the day, as traders hash out what all this means for equities.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Stocks initially shot higher right after the news hit that the Fed was standing pat, but by the time Ms. Yellen stepped to the microphone, they had fallen back to almost exactly where the had started.</span> As she's been speaking, they've climbed again, and now sit <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.9% at</span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2158,</span> a fresh high for Wednesday's session.

Ms. Yellen got a couple of chances to comment on the banking scandal de jour, at Wells Fargo & Co.
Ms. Yellen noted the leading role of other regulatory agencies, but she said that “this has been and will be a focus of our supervision” of Wells Fargo.
Ms. Yellen was asked whether banks can be too big and complex to manage. The context for the question was Wells Fargo, where wide-scale problems were allowed to fester. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Was the bank just too big?
Ms. Yellen responded that the Fed has ""high expectations for what we expect to be in place in a large organization"" -- such as strong risk management, auditing and a competent board of directors that holds senior management accountable.
</span>""I don't think these are impossible standards to meet,"" she said. ""I wouldn't arrive at the conclusion that just because an organization is large they can't live up to those standards.<span id=""33"" class=""red"">""
Treasurys' yield curve is flattening after the Fed pronouncements, with the underperformance of short-dated notes reflecting the likelihood that a rate hike this year remains solidly on the table.
</span>The curve has been jumpy of late—flattening most <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016 before</span> steepening amid the bond selloff of the past two weeks amid concerns about the Bank of Japan possibly shifting focus to engineer a steeper curve.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">But the U.S. curve is flattening again this week, and some believe the Fed's tightening bias—even on a very slow path—makes it hard for yields to steepen much unless inflation flares up.</span> The 10-year note's yield premium relative to 2s is <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 88 basis</span> points, near the least since 2007; it <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 91 basis</span> points yesterday.
<span id=""35"" class=""red"">— Min Zeng
It's a good question about tariffs and their economic impact.</span> But Ms. Yellen wants none of it.
That's a political issue current being debated, she says. ""I'm going to pass on that one.<span id=""36"" class=""red"">""
Ms. Yellen previously said that the Fed was closely watching asset markets, especially the commercial real estate market, for signs of overheating.</span> Asked specifically in a follow up whether the concern was a bubble, Ms. Yellen said it was.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">She reiterated the steps the Fed has taken to improve its approach to financial stability in recent years and added that, on the regulatory front, she believes the Fed has taken constructive steps that make the financial system safer today than it was a decade ago.
</span>""The soundness and state of the banking system has improved substantially,"" she said.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">Asked again about charges that the Fed is politically compromised, Ms. Yellen has news for you: ""The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised.</span>""
So there. <span id=""39"" class=""red"">The Fed does not discuss politics in its meetings, she says.</span> ""I can't recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion."" <span id=""40"" class=""red"">If the public were watching on TV they would have seen ""a rich, deep, serious intellectual debate about the risks in the forecasts for the economy.</span>""
""We struggled mightily with trying to understand one another's points of view, and to come out at a balanced place and to act responsibly,"" she says. ""And that's my commitment to the American people, that I want to lead an institution that is not political....<span id=""41"" class=""red"">We are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has assigned to us, which are important ones of price stability and maximum employment.</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">""
In case she left any doubt, a followup question offers this answer from her: ""I have no concern that the Fed is politically motivated.</span> And I will assure you that you will not find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are released in five years.<span id=""43"" class=""red"">""
Ms. Yellen really doesn’t want to talk about the presidential election and whether it poses a risk to the U.S. economy.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">“I’m not going to get into politics,” she said when asked why the Fed seems less concerned about the upcoming U.S. vote than it did about this summer’s Brexit vote in the U.K.
One theory for some of the economy's weakness this year is that businesses, in particular, are reluctant to invest because they're uncertain about what U.S. economic policy will look like after the election.
</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen agreed that business investment has been inexplicably weak.</span> She said that ""investment spending really has been quite weak for some time and we're really not certain what is causing that. Part has been the huge contraction in drilling, but ... the weakness in investment spending extends beyond that sector and I'm not certain of exactly what explains that.""
Ms. Yellen declined to blame it on the politics, saying she was unaware of specific evidence on that. <span id=""46"" class=""red"">It's true that there's no smoking gun, but worth noting that economists increasingly do believe uncertainty from the election is the cause of business investment sagging.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Is the global reach for yield a cost from the Fed's accommodative policy?
</span>Well, maybe. <span id=""48"" class=""red"">Most advanced nations are doing the same thing, Ms. Yellen says, and it seems to be necessary to achieve employment and inflation objectives.</span> ""That is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield.<span id=""49"" class=""red"">""
The takeaway: ""I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability risks.</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">""
Ms. Yellen says the Fed regularly assesses financial stability, and right now the overall threat is ""moderate.""</span> She says asset valuations are not out of line with historical norms. While commercial real estate values are high, lending standards there are tightening. <span id=""51"" class=""red"">And the Fed is not seeing signs of leverage building up or maturity transformation like before the last crisis.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen was just asked about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s recent charge that the Fed is holding rates down to benefit the current (Democratic) administration.
</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">Ms. Yellen, appearing to refer to prepared notes and not mentioning Mr. Trump by name, said that the Fed is set up to be independent from partisan politics.</span> “We do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions,” she said.
<span id=""54"" class=""red"">As for the odds of a rate move at the Fed’s next policy meeting in early November, which comes mere days before the presidential election, Ms. Yellen simply reiterated her usual refrain that “every meeting is live.”</span>"

Plunge in Lira, Turkey’s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion
Turkey’s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.
Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes.</span> A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Turkey’s central bank insisted over the weekend that it would “take all necessary measures” to preserve the country’s financial stability.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But it has so far refused to raise interest rates, and the changes it has pushed through thus far have been limited in scope.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After the Turkish lira fell even further — one dollar <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">bought 3.8 liras</span> at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 7.2 liras</span> — investors dumped other emerging-market currencies.</span> The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 2 percent</span> after falling <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 6 percent</span> last week.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 percent</span></span> during the day.</span> European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">In early trading on Wall Street, the S.&P.<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 500 stock</span>-index <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 0.7 percent</span>, but quickly recovered and turned positive.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Turkey’s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,” Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.
</span>Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country — in this case, Turkey — can quickly spread to other regions.
</span>Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country’s prospects. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank’s independence.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Normally, a country in Turkey’s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency’s slide.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But Mr. Erdogan’s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“In the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as ‘risk off’ toward emerging markets,” said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.
</span>But “Turkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren’t,” he added. “I don’t think it’s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">On Monday, Turkey’s central bank relaxed some of its rules on the money that commercial banks must keep on reserve, freeing up cash to deal with the currency crisis.</span> The central bank also said that it would provide “all the liquidity the banks need.”
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 17.75 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.
</span>In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Do not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,” he said.</span> “You would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists’ and merchants’ responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C.”
Yet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey’s interior ministry had opened investigations <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 346 social</span> media accounts officials said had helped “manipulate perceptions” about the lira.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Compounding the fear in financial markets, there is a lack of information about which foreign banks may own Turkish government bonds or have lent money to Turkish companies.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 90 percent</span> of Turkey’s public and private sector debt with foreign lenders is in foreign currencies, according to the International Monetary Fund.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.
</span>A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">President Trump pledged on Friday to double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The comment, which was made in a Twitter post, spooked markets concerned that Mr. Trump could take a similar approach with other trading partners.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">“The catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade,” said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING.</span> “This is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it’s a pretty toxic environment.”
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">China’s currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump’s trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.34 percent</span> against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 15 months</span>.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">China’s main stock index lost <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 percent</span></span> at one point on Monday, but it closed <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 0.3 percent</span>.</span> The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percent</span>. Stocks in Seoul <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.5 percent</span>. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">A broad index of Europe’s biggest companies was <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 0.4 percent</span> in afternoon trading.
</span>A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Turkey’s economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">“I’m a little concerned, but I wouldn’t be pressing the panic button,” the economist, Xu Sitao, said.

54130,"<h3>Biden just blasted Trump on one of his biggest weaknesses. More will follow.</h3>Crucial to President Trump’s political mystique is maintaining the illusion that he is perpetually winning, basking in adoring crowds, in total control of events and dominating his foes on every front — no matter how dramatically he must falsify reality to keep that impression alive.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">And so, even though Trump’s tariff wars are growing so unhinged and unpopular that members of his own party are rebelling against them, the president’s political team is leaking word that he’s going on offense bigly on trade, against his No.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 perceived</span> enemy of the moment: the Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.
</span>But now, I’m told, Biden is gearing up to take Trump on over the issue, opening up a new front in an area that is central to Trump’s reelection hopes, and one that some Democrats have shied away from.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a statement sent to this blog, the Biden campaign sharpened its criticism of Trump on trade, hammering his agenda as “erratic and impulsive,” while claiming it’s imposing untold “economic pain” on ordinary Americans via a “Trump Tax” and diminishing our country’s standing in the world.
</span>According to new reporting by Axios, the Trump campaign privately sees Biden as a threat to him in the industrial Midwest, which will be pivotal to reelection, because “internal Trump polls have Biden substantially ahead in the Rust Belt.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">So the plan, Axios reports, is for Trump allies to begin hammering Biden as a “free-trading globalist who would undo the president’s trade agenda.”</span> They will do this by raising questions, such as: “What specifically will Biden do with China? Will he lift President Trump’s tariffs? How does Biden defend his past advocacy for NAFTA?”
The Biden campaign is hitting back. In a statement sent my way, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said this:
We can’t trust President Trump to look out for American workers, because for all his bluster, he never does. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Just look at the record: The trade deficit is larger than when Trump took office, he’s forced labor to take a back seat in his dealings with China, and he’s alienated our allies who also suffer from China’s trade abuses.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Instead of delivering results, Trump is asking American farmers and American families to bear all the costs of his trade war.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">His administration’s erratic and impulsive approach to China is causing families economic pain.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Joe Biden would rally our friends and allies to hold China accountable, so that working families and farmers don’t pay an extra Trump Tax.</span> Biden would also restore our standing in the world on <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Day 1,</span> advance our security and prosperity, and deliver results for all Americans -- not just the well connected.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">What’s noteworthy here is the effort to tie Trump’s trade failures to a broader failure of Trumpian nationalism.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The New York Times reports that the Trump campaign believes his continued trade war with China could be a political plus, letting Trump “cater to his political base” while “heading off any Democratic attempts to outflank him as the great protector of American workers.”
</span>But there’s no reason to presume in advance that Trump has the upper hand on this issue. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Unlike <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> voters have now seen the concrete results of Trump’s nationalist trade bluster — and the genuinely held worldview underpinning it — colliding with the complex realities of international diplomacy and the global economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">That collision has rendered Trump vulnerable on trade — even in the Rust Belt.</span> A new Detroit News poll of Michigan finds that Trump trails most Democratic hopefuls, some by large margins. Notably,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47 percent</span> of Michigan voters say Trump’s China policies are bad for the state, vs. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 26 percent</span> who say the opposite.
Crucially, among Michigan union households, opposition climbs <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 55 percent</span>, and independents oppose the policies <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2 to</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span> Those groups likely include many of the blue-collar white and Obama-Trump voters Democrats must win back. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, recent Quinnipiac polling found that in the industrial Midwest states, Trump’s trade policies are underwater.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">What’s more, Democrats have a good argument to make against Trump on trade: that his nationalism in practice has proved reckless, rooted in rage and whim; alienating to allies; and counterproductive, and that Democrats would restore sober, reality-based international cooperation to the center of our trade agenda.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Such an approach might be employed, say, against China’s currency manipulation practices, as progressive economist Dean Baker points out.</span> “A multilateral approach would likely mean getting the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States to negotiate a rise in the Chinese yuan of some targeted amount against the dollar,” Baker told me.
By blasting Trump’s agenda as “erratic and impulsive” and by vowing to rally allies against China and to “restore our standing in the world,” the Biden campaign is beginning to road-test such an argument.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Biden takes hits from the left on trade
All this comes as Biden might himself be vulnerable on the issue.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Progressives such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have staked out aggressive positions against trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, both of which Biden supported.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Sanders recently ripped Biden for expressing skepticism that China is going to “eat our lunch,” arguing that Biden downplayed the Chinese threat to U.S. workers and vowing himself to offer a trade agenda that is in their interests.
</span>A Biden campaign source tells me that Biden offered this in the spirit of trying to disarm Trump’s demagoguery of the China threat, which is the groundwork for a case for a more rational, multilateral approach in place of threats and bluster.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Biden has knocked Trump’s trade war with China, and we should expect a more comprehensive substantive blueprint from him in coming months.
</span>The differences between the primary candidates on China will be litigated in the primaries, of course. And so will Biden’s position on NAFTA, which he has since defended, though some polls suggest it might not matter a great deal to Democratic voters.
But this debate is all to the good. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Whoever the Democratic nominee is, he or she may unite the party around an agenda built on multilateral cooperation against China, higher wage, labor and environmental standards in trade deals, and serious investments in displaced U.S. workers.</span> Such a debate will ultimately put Democrats in a stronger position against Trump in an area where he’s weaker than all the bluster suggests.

Inflation continued to slow on an annual basis in December, welcome relief for American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Consumer Price Index <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government’s official inflation measure over time.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They worry that services inflation — which is unusually rapid — could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank’s target.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed aims <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February — adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022.</span>
“I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,” Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. “In my view, hikes <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">That was up <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">“What we’ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,” Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">“Service inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.”
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">“The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“We’re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,” James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

Lower gas prices helped to pull inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index’s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes — even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Here’s what to know about the December inflation report:
Overall inflation cooled <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Energy prices overall were <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down<span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">Food prices <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.
</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=""39"" class=""red"">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023.</span></span></span>
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly — or decline outright — as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers — like hotels and day-care centers — to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">December’s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.
</span><span id=""47"" class=""red"">Food prices rose <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">Food prices overall were <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.
</span><span id=""52"" class=""red"">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">The price of oranges dipped<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.
</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">President Biden celebrated Thursday’s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is “coming down in America month after month” even as it remains high in major economies around the world.
</span><span id=""56"" class=""red"">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.
</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">“It all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,” Mr. Biden said.
</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession — with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=""60"" class=""red"">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.
</span><span id=""61"" class=""red"">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.
<span id=""62"" class=""red"">“Out-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> “Congress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.”
<span id=""63"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax — which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.

The</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.

<span id=""66"" class=""red"">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=""67"" class=""red"">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.
</span><span id=""68"" class=""red"">That’s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed’s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=""69"" class=""red"">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.
</span><span id=""70"" class=""red"">“The risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,” said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> “What we see today is that may be the case. <span id=""71"" class=""red"">The Fed will be worried about that.”
</span><span id=""72"" class=""red"">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed’s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.
</span><span id=""73"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""74"" class=""red"">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=""75"" class=""red"">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.
</span><span id=""76"" class=""red"">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors’ expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed’s next increase in interest rates, <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=""77"" class=""red"">The Fed’s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.25 to</span><span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.5 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""78"" class=""red"">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.72 percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.
<span id=""79"" class=""red"">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated to slow inflation; the longer interest rates stay high, the more pressure they put on company costs, and the higher the risk that the economy slips into recession.
</span>“We think any rally here based on the C.P.I. report will be temporary,” said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. <span id=""80"" class=""red"">“We have months if not quarters ahead of us where we need to see much lower levels of inflation, and we think we will get there</span> but it’s going to take time.”

42242,"<h3>Opinion | Homeowners aren’t ready to face how much less their houses are worth</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Over the years, I have encountered a lot of weird statements from company chief executives announcing layoffs or business setbacks.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But possibly the strangest one came on Wednesday from Redfin chief executive Glenn Kelman, who said his firm was letting go <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 13 percent</span> of its workforce, and shuttering its “iBuying” division, which bought homes directly from consumers, did light renovations and put them back on the market.
</span>Anyone who has watched a house-flipping show knows how hard it can be to make money that way. Around this time last year, Zillow closed its own iBuying division after losing buckets of money. Yet this is not how Kelman explained his move. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We’re closing our iBuying business, RedfinNow,” he said in a statement, “because maintaining a profit with rising interest rates would make our offers on homes insultingly low.”
</span>Insultingly! <span id=""3"" class=""red"">What is insulting about offering people the market price for their house?</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Homeowners are presumably aware that mortgage rates have spiked, thanks to the Federal Reserve Board’s aggressive policy, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topping 7 percent</span> in the latest report from Freddie Mac.</span> And because owners already have homes and mortgages, they are also aware that when rates are higher, people cannot afford to pay as much for houses.
And yet I don’t think Kelman is crazy; he’s probably right. Many homeowners would be insulted by what Redfin could rationally offer. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">His statement is strange because the housing market is in a very strange place — and finding a new normal will require some ugly adjustments, psychological as well as financial.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">As I noted in June, most American homeowners have known only a world of steadily falling interest rates.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mortgage rates hit their all-time high in the early 1980s, as the Fed under Paul Volcker aggressively tightened monetary policy to fight record inflation.</span> Since then, rates have followed a long downward trend. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Prices responded with a corresponding upward trend — albeit with some brutal interruptions, most notably, the collapse of the housing bubble <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2006.</span>
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">During the financial crisis, however, the Fed stepped in with more easy money, and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2022 most</span> homeowners were sitting on a nice chunk of equity.</span> This made homeowners feel prosperous and secure. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">It probably also boosted consumer demand, because people who feel richer are willing to spend more.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">And despite the memories of the crash, most people still take it for granted that housing is a great investment as well as a way to keep the rain off their heads.
</span>These trends could not go on forever. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">During the pandemic, my credit union was offering 15-year fixed-rate mortgages for less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 percent</span> annual interest, and they weren’t going to keep lowering that rate until they were paying me money to buy a house.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Now, we are in the midst of a sharp reversal and prices will have to adjust accordingly.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Someone who could have gotten a mortgage <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 percent</span> a few years ago now has to pay more than twice that.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">To keep their mortgage payment the same, the cost of the house would have to fall by almost half.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Now, not everyone has to worry so much about their monthly payment; older home buyers who have built up some equity aren’t as sensitive to mortgage rates.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But unless prices drop significantly, the market will be starved of new entrants — which means falling demand and, ultimately, lower prices.
</span>Home buyers aren’t yet ready to recognize the extent of that loss, so they won’t sell their homes unless they really, really have to. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Especially because moving would mean giving up the absurdly low mortgage rates that prevailed before the Fed got serious about fighting inflation.
</span>Many of the real estate listings in my neighborhood now have an eerie quality, like looking at the twinkling light of some long-dead star. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Houses sit on the market or prices drift downward in tiny increments that are wholly inadequate to the magnitude of the interest-rate shift.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Though supply remains quite low by historical standards, inventories are rising, and sales have fallen by almost a quarter.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Homeowners seem to be sitting out the market, waiting for the return of the good times.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">This helps explain why median sales prices have fallen by only <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span>, from a June high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $413,800 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $384,800 in</span> September — and were still up year-over-year.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Of course, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7 percent</span> decline might be a good deal if interest rates fall back to where they were fairly quickly.</span> Home buyers could suffer a high payment for a couple of years, and then refinance into something more affordable — and sellers could avoid taking a hit to their personal wealth. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">That’s one way we could get out of this strange market.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">But it’s hard to imagine that interest rates are going back to where they were during the pandemic.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">The public health crisis is over, and the Fed is now in inflation-fighting mode.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">We homeowners might never again be as rich as we felt <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 and</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2021 </span>— which would mean that the only way the market can go back to normal is for us to eventually, painfully admit that we’re poorer, and move on.</span>"
5923,"<h3>From Outsider to Insider: Karen Bass’s Unexpected Journey to Power</h3>LOS ANGELES — <span id=""0"" class=""red""><span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> as California confronted its most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression, the center of power in the state capital was a tent.</span> It was set up in the courtyard outside the office of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California’s most influential players — mostly white men — went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.
But not Karen Bass.
Newly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“‘I guess you probably don’t want to be doing business here,’” the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> “He didn’t know what to do. And that was right. I didn’t want to be in the tent.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation’s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.
</span>“They didn’t know what to make of me,” she said.
Today Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-’em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who — like the men in that tent in Sacramento — are now trying to figure out what to make of her.
And of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden — in the story of her life and the story of her politics — as the Democratic congresswoman from California.
Ms. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.
Ms. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One of Ms. Bass’s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.
</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.
[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]
In many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party’s candidate for vice president. She talks more about conciliation than confrontation and does not have as many detractors as some of her rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ms. Bass’s advocacy of liberal positions on criminal justice, poverty, housing, foster care and welfare could provide a Biden-Bass ticket a lift with progressive and younger voters.</span> She would arguably be the most liberal politician chosen for vice president since Jimmy Carter tapped Walter F. Mondale as his running mate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1976.</span>
But her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.
In the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro’s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that “the passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.” Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.
Ms. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro “Comandante en Jefe,” a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. “Wouldn’t do that again,” she said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Talked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn’t have been said.”
She said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. “Now, that doesn’t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,” she said.
Chapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.
In one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, “Just so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.”
Back in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office — not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.
And certainly not for vice president.
“Oh God, no!” she said. “There isn’t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.”
As Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.
“When a woman is in a role that’s new, people underestimate,” she said. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“You need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?”
‘I felt like I had failed a generation’
As she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.
After graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.
While elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis — hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.
“What she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people — she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.
What made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.
For young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don’t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.
At the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1991.</span>
Ms. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change — “finally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,” she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.
“I felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn’t gotten change,” she said.
In the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.
<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.
One of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.
“The crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,” said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass’s. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“She knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.”
Ms. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city — drugs, crime, poverty — in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.
</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.
Then, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly. The outside player was ready to move to the inside.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Crafting a way out of fiscal crisis
California was sliding into crisis — <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $41 billion</span> deficit, larger than the entire budget of many states — when Ms. Bass was elected speaker in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2008.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">For the next two years, she and other legislative leaders struggled with Mr. Schwarzenegger over a punishing package of spending cuts and tax increases to rescue California from its worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.
</span>It also was a time of a tragedy in her life: <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2006,</span> her only daughter and her son-in-law were killed in a car crash, an echo of the loss Mr. Biden has experienced; his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1972.</span>
“I had a choice as to whether to go back to work or hide,” Ms. Bass said. “I had to embrace the grief and wrap myself in grief. People don’t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don’t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn’t ask to be a part of.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state’s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“It was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,” said Michael C. Genest, who was Mr. Schwarzenegger’s top financial adviser.</span> “The major dynamic was that Republicans wanted to cut, Democrats wanted to raise taxes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And the reality was we could never cut enough to balance the budget.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">And we could never raise taxes enough to balance the budget.”
</span>Democrats held a substantial majority in the Assembly and the Senate. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">But passing a budget in California at the time required a vote by two-thirds of members of each chamber.</span> As a result, Republican leaders had significant power in the negotiations.
John A. Pérez, who succeeded Ms. Bass as speaker, said the dynamic of a minority party holding the votes needed to pass legislation greatly complicated her negotiations with the Senate and governor.
“But then she had the hard work of delivering the votes in the caucus,” he said. “And nobody goes to office to make cuts on programs they hold near and dear.”
Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who was the mayor of Los Angeles at the time, said he had pushed her for speaker because he thought she had the political skills to navigate a particularly difficult time in Sacramento.
“I thought we needed a leader who could work across the aisles,” he said. “She’s unabashedly a progressive, but she’s also practical and she knows how to work with Republicans.”
It was during that period that she honed the political and legislative skill that have drawn the attention of Mr. Biden — the drive for consensus, a quiet if firm manner, an ability to work with people on the other side of the political spectrum.
“I would make the decisions and go tell everybody: OK, this is the decision we made,” said Fabian Núñez, who was speaker before Ms. Bass. “She was a coalition builder. She wanted the buy-in.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">To this day, Ms. Bass remembers the unlikely alliance with Mr. Schwarzenegger and how they navigated the budget crisis from vastly different ideological perspectives.</span> She would joke morosely when it came time for the daily walk through the Capitol to Mr. Schwarzenegger’s office, past the clusters of reporters and lobbyists.
“She used to refer to our daily negotiations as going to Gitmo,” said Darrell Steinberg, who was the Democratic leader of the Senate at the time and is now the mayor of Sacramento. “‘Gotta go to Gitmo.’”
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The budget deal agreed to in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2009 forced</span> sharp concessions from Democrats and Republicans:<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $14.8 billion</span> in cuts from health care, education, public transit and other social services;<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $12.5 billion</span> in tax increases;$5.4 billion in borrowing; and various accounting gimmicks, including reliance on an infusion of federal aid.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And as the state economy kept deteriorating, and voters refused to approve some of the taxes, California was back in the red by spring, forcing Ms. Bass to support even more budget cuts.
</span>“She was unflappable,” Mr. Steinberg said. “It was high-stress. And we were making decisions that we did not want to make. Deep cuts to things that we cherished.”
Ms. Bass found herself having to go against years of her advocacy by yielding to Mr. Schwarzenegger and Republicans on issues like foster care and welfare.
“It was very devastating personally,” she said. “The whole reason I wanted to run for office to begin with was to expand the social safety net.”
As Ms. Bass finds herself in contention for a position she had never sought or considered, a critical question has emerged: Is the ability to seek consensus versus confrontation, which has served her so well over the decades, what is required for a vice-presidential candidate in today’s brutal political environment?
The No.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 person</span> on the ticket is often expected to carry the burden of delivering searing attacks. Mr. Biden’s running mate is likely to face particular scrutiny from Mr. Trump, who has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the former vice president.
That said, Ms. Bass’s nonthreatening style and ability to make alliances could prove to be a tonic in Washington in a post-Trump era. She counts among her friends an old fellow legislator from Sacramento, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and Trump ally.
“People use the word nice about her, if you notice,” Mr. Villaraigosa said. “But I think a better word is — she knows how to stand up for what she believes in, without being difficult.”
Ms. Bass said that she was glad to hear herself described as nice “as opposed to mean” and that with the nation reeling from an epidemic, confrontation politics seemed petty. But, she added, “Nice doesn’t mean I wouldn’t fight.”"
86825,"<h3>Covid Live Updates: War-Torn Yemen Sees Virus Cases Spike, Charity Says</h3>Covid Live Updates: War-Torn Yemen Sees Virus Cases Spike, Charity Says
The official death toll doesn’t tell the story, the British organization Oxfam says. The C.D.C. director overruled her own advisers and recommended Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for health care workers and others at risk.
War-torn Yemen, where the overwhelming majority of the population is unvaccinated, is seeing coronavirus cases multiply and deaths soar, according to a report this week by the British charity Oxfam.
Oxfam found that Covid deaths had increased by more than fivefold in the past month and that recorded Covid cases had tripled. The charity said actual figures were likely to be much higher, with many unregistered cases and deaths.
The official Covid death toll <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,658,</span> and recorded cases have <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 8,789.</span> But the situation in the country of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 million</span> is hard to gauge. “Countless” others have died in their homes or have not been diagnosed because of scarce tests and hospital beds, Oxfam said.
Yemen is still embroiled in a war that began <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 when</span> Iran-backed rebels know as the Houthis seized the country’s northwest, including the capital, Sana, sending the government into exile. The government has effectively collapsed, and tens of thousands have died.
The country already faced many health challenges before the coronavirus emerged. Hunger is widespread, medicines are hard to find and there have been outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.
The pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, and rights groups say that it is adding to the burden of an already wrecked health care system.
“Covid has made life even worse for people across the country,” Abdulwasea Mohammed, Oxfam’s policy and advocacy lead for Yemen, said by phone from Sana.
Some relief could come with vaccines, but fewer <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 percent</span> of Yemenis have so far received a single vaccine dose, and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 0.05 percent</span> are fully vaccinated, according to Oxfam.
The country is relying on vaccines from the global Covax program. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">But Covax is struggling to meet its global supply target, and only half a million out of a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">promised 4.2 million</span> doses have reached Yemen so far, Oxfam said.
</span>Few isolation centers exist for Covid patients. The ones that are operating are found only in major cities like the capital Sana, and they are overflowing with people, Mr. Mohammed said. The poorly equipped hospitals are also seeing more people than they can accommodate. And many Yemenis cannot afford transportation to health care facilities.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">With half the population having lost their source of income, staying at home means possibly dying of hunger for many Yemenis who have become day earners, Mr. Mohammed said.</span> But appearing to be sick means being shunned, so if they have mild symptoms, people are reluctant to seek medical care or testing for the virus at the very few testing centers available.
In shelters that host <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 4 million</span> internally displaced people, a family <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 is</span> likely to share one small tent, making precautionary measures impossible.
“The country is not able to cope with another health crisis,” Mr. Mohammed said.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Most Yemenis survive on humanitarian aid, which Oxfam says has been in short supply.</span> Only half of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $3.9 billion</span> essential aid package requested by the United Nations from donor countries has been received. The health care system is dangerously underfunded, working with <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 11 percent</span> of what it needs, the organization says.
Some had hoped that the pandemic would force Yemen’s warring parties into a truce, but the war continues.
“If anything, it is amazing how little the pandemic has affected the fighting,” said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst on Yemen for the International Crisis Group, in an interview.
The terror and uncertainty of the war, which has forced people to deal with loss on a daily basis for years, remains a larger concern for many Yemenis than the pandemic itself. “This speaks to the trauma of the conflict,” Mr. Salisbury said.

Alaska, once a leader in vaccinating its citizens, is now in the throes of its worst coronavirus surge of the pandemic, as the Delta variant rips through the state, swamping hospitals with patients.
As of Thursday, the state was <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaging 125 new</span> cases a day for <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every 100,000 people</span>, more than any other in the nation, according to recent data trends collected by The New York Times. That figure has shot up <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.
On Wednesday, the state said it had activated “crisis standards of care,” giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.
“We have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,” Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.
Jared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge “crippling” in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.
There is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.
“We are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,” Mr. Kosin said.
Critically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
“Unlike in the <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lower 48,</span> you don’t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,” said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.
Mr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. “That is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,” he said.
Alaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.
Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.
“We’re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,” Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.
On the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.
The state’s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country’s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.

The C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency’s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.
The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration’s endorsements over her own agency’s advisers.
The C.D.C.’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.’s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.
Dr. Walensky’s decision was a boost for President Biden’s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.
The C.D.C.’s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.
“I am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.
But the vote on boosters for occupational risk “was close,” Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky’s decision.
“This addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,” Dr. Maldonado added.
Minutes before Dr. Walensky’s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director’s decision.
“Dr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,” Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. “I am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.”
Dr. Walensky’s decision to go against her own agency’s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director’s endorsement of the advisory committee’s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.
But experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.’s decision. “There’s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement” on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would “best serve the nation’s public health needs.”
</span>SEOUL — South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.
At a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family. The government is encouraging people to get tested following the holiday.
Chuseok is roughly equivalent to American Thanksgiving and was observed from Monday through Wednesday. The Korea Transport Institute estimated that <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 32 million</span> people would travel over the holiday.
Over the past week the nation was averaging <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,500 new</span> cases a day, according to statistics collected by Our World in Data. Most cases are concentrated in the capital, Seoul, and surrounding areas, but officials were concerned that the holiday would spread the virus more widely.
Testing and quarantining were the main tools South Korea used to curb the spread of the disease, and the country was able to keep outbreaks at bay in the early part of the pandemic.
South Korea’s vaccination program got off to a slow start, but the country has now <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vaccinated 43 percent</span> of its population. It hopes to <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 70 percent</span> of its population inoculated by October.
“There is no problem at all with the amount of vaccines secured for this year,” President Moon Jae-in said on Friday, according to Reuters. “The vaccine shipment got off to a slower start than other countries, which delayed the vaccination program, but I believe by next month, we will catch up and be a leading country by inoculation rate.”
A few weeks ago the government relaxed several restrictions on in-person meetings. For Chuseok, family gatherings of up to eight people were permitted if at least four people were fully vaccinated.

Hospitals near a grocery store shooting in Collierville, Tenn., were already struggling to keep up with Covid-19 patients when those injured in the attack arrived in emergency rooms on Thursday.
National Guard troops had been stationed at medical centers to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients, and emergency medical providers had recently issued a dire warning to local officials about the strain on hospitals.
“Currently our system emergency departments are operating dangerously over capacity,” the medical providers wrote on Aug.<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 16.</span> They added, “We may be unable to provide timely care to everyone and will have to make choices about delivering care to patients based on their probability of survival.”
They expressed particular concern about what could happen in the event of a disaster, given that “the city has no surge capacity to accommodate any additional disaster or unplanned events.”
An average <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 96 percent</span> of I.C.U. beds were occupied in Shelby County, Tenn., on Thursday, according to New York Times data. One nearby facility, St. Francis Hospital, reported that its I.C.U. <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 100 percent</span> full; another said its I.C.U. <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 97 percent</span> full. There <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 15 I</span>.C.U. beds available in the five counties in and around Memphis as <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5 p</span>.m. Wednesday, according to the Shelby County Health Department.
Officials said at least a dozen people were hurt and one killed inside the Kroger store in Collierville, <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 miles</span> east of Memphis in Shelby County.
Regional One Health, a hospital in Memphis, had received nine patients injured in the shooting, according to a spokeswoman. She said the hospital had the capacity to accommodate those patients. Baptist Memorial Hospital in Collierville received one patient, who was discharged, and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis received two, according to a spokeswoman.
Shelby County reported its highest number of Covid-19 cases during the pandemic last month. Those numbers have decreased slightly in recent weeks but remain high, with a seven-day average <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 409 cases</span>.
<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Only 44 percent</span> of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated. Governor Bill Lee recently signed an executive order overruling attempts by local officials to require masks in schools. A federal judge blocked the governor’s order from taking effect in Shelby County on Friday after opponents fought it in court.

SYDNEY, Australia — In the war against the coronavirus’s Delta variant, few if any democracies have demanded as much of their people as Australia.
In the middle of the latest lockdowns, the police in Sydney gave hefty fines to three mothers with strollers chatting in a park. Melbourne’s playgrounds were wrapped in police tape, and traveling from a state with Covid restrictions to one without — for the lucky few granted permission by the authorities — requires two-week stints in quarantine at a hotel or a remote former mining camp.
There are now two Australias. In Perth, offices, pubs and stadiums are crammed and normal as ever — the payoff for a closed-border approach that has made Western Australia an island within an island. In Sydney, residents are approaching their 14th week of lockdown. The working-class areas with the highest infection rates have faced a heavy police presence, and, until recently, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 9 p</span>.m. curfew and just an hour of outdoor exercise per day.
Is the sacrifice worth it?
Australia is at a crossroads with Covid. The confidence and pride <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020,</span> when lockdowns and isolation brought outbreaks to heel, have been replaced by doubt, fatigue and a bitter battle over how much freedom or risk should be allowed in a Delta-defined future.
Some states are trying desperately to hold on to what worked before, while New South Wales and Victoria, home to the country’s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are being forced by Delta outbreaks to find a more nuanced path forward. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has thrown his weight behind a plan to reopen <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">when 80 percent</span> of adults are fully vaccinated. But the road ahead may not be smooth — as shown by protests this week over a vaccine mandate — and state leaders are still insisting that they will go it alone.
“We might be looking at the country turning the clock back on itself,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a political theorist at the University of Sydney. “There is an explicit insularity and parochialism that now dictates debate.”"
