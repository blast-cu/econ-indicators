Will Biden Be an Activist President on the World Stage?
Despite cascading crises at home that will need his urgent attention, some foreign policy experts predict the new U.S. leader will take an energetic role in foreign policy.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">LONDON — A decade ago, Joseph R. Biden Jr. strode into a reception room in Athens for a meeting with the president of Greece, a country then drowning in debt and locked in tense negotiations with the European Union.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“This man represents the Treasury Department,” a deadpan Mr. Biden said to his host as he gestured to a gray-suited member of his delegation.</span> “He’s brought hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The room broke up in laughter: It was clear the vice president hadn’t come with a briefcase of cash to pay off Greece’s debts. But his joke captured a deeper truth — <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> many still viewed the United States as the ultimate guarantor of the international order. And Mr. Biden clearly saw himself as a steward of that legacy, his easy self-confidence the product of four decades as a globe-trotting senator.
As Mr. Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday, vowing to “repair our alliances and engage with the world once more,” the question for many overseas is whether they will see this man of the world anytime soon.
In capitals from Europe to Asia, diplomats and foreign-policy experts have questioned whether the United States is too divided, too weakened and too preoccupied by internal convulsions to play the kind of leadership role that Mr. Biden took for granted as a senator and vice president.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet there are reasons to believe President Biden will be more visible and activist than many expect, even as he grapples with the pandemic, a massive economic recovery effort, and the deep divisions left by the Trump era.</span> From the people he has chosen for key foreign policy posts to the travel opportunities he has this year, those who know Mr. Biden say he is unlikely to stay off the global stage for long.
“This is a guy who <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 40 years</span> getting to know foreign leaders around the world,” said Peter Westmacott, who lived next door to Mr. Biden as British ambassador to Washington during the Obama administration. “Once you’ve got a flavor for international relationships, you don’t turn your back on all that.”
Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States, said he expected Mr. Biden to draw on his personal relationships to mend bonds with European allies that had been sundered by former President Donald J. Trump.
“Joe Biden is a master of networking, and he will easily repair the lack of trust,” said Mr. Ischinger, who now runs the Munich Security Forum.

Mr. Ischinger’s immediate goal is to persuade the president to attend his influential annual conference. He has a decent chance of landing him: Mr. Biden has been a staple in Munich for years, most memorably <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> when he announced that President Barack Obama wanted to hit the “reset button” with Russia.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Biden said the “world is watching.” He promised that the United States had “come out stronger” from its recent stress test. And he pledged a restoration of American leadership in which, he said, “we’ll lead, not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.”
Mr. Biden is likely to make his formal debut at a meeting of Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 leaders</span> in June, which Britain is hosting at a seaside resort in Cornwall. He may expand that trip to include other European destinations, including Germany, where he could bid farewell to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she steps down <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 16 years</span>.
In the fall, Mr. Biden is expected to attend a Group <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 meeting</span> in Rome and the United Nations’ climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where he could showcase his decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord.
Beyond dates in the diplomatic diary, experts contend that Mr. Biden’s appointments do not suggest an inward-looking White House.
His choice of Kurt M. Campbell to serve as a high-level coordinator of Asia policy, for example, could foretell a tough line with China coupled with an energetic effort to reassure American allies Japan and South Korea. As a State Department official in the Obama administration, Mr. Campbell devised the so-called “pivot” to Asia.
“Biden has chosen people who understand and are committed to strategic competition,” said Thomas Wright, a foreign-policy expert at the Brookings Institution.
Some experts argue that the chaos at the Capitol had compromised the nation’s traditional role as a champion of democracy, and that the cascading domestic crises would consume Mr. Biden’s energy, distracting from world affairs.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Ambitious foreign-policy goals are completely out of step with the realities of the country’s domestic political and economic dysfunction,” Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in Foreign Policy.</span> “How can the United States spread democracy or act as an example for others if it barely has a functioning democracy at home?”
But Mr. Wright argued that the homegrown threats to democracy should strengthen the Biden administration’s resolve to fight human-rights abuses by China, Russia, and other autocratic governments.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve never understood the trade-off between ambition at home and ambition overseas,” he said.</span> “It’s precisely because democracy is challenged at home that the U.S. needs to be more energetic in defending democracy overseas.”
The links between domestic and foreign policy were reinforced by the appointment of Susan E. Rice, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Obama, as director of Mr. Biden’s domestic policy council. Key domestic priorities like the pandemic, experts pointed out, are also global challenges.
Another top Biden aide, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, used Twitter to weigh in on sensitive issues before his boss took office. He condemned Russia’s arrest of the opposition leader Alexei A. Navalny, appealed to the European Union to think twice before signing an investment treaty with China, and said Mr. Trump’s designation of the Houthi rebels in Yemen as a terrorist group “will only inflict more suffering on Yemeni people.”
Whether the Biden administration will back up those words with action remains to be seen, of course. But some say that Mr. Biden’s instincts, temperament and background as a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee make him unlikely to shrug off chances to command the world stage.
As vice president, he reveled in his access to world leaders. On a trip to Turkey <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> there were doubts that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was recuperating from a medical procedure, would see him. Instead, Mr. Erdogan invited him to his private residence, where the two men, wearing slippers, spoke for two hours about Syria and Iran.
“I don’t want to sound like I’m inflating my importance or relationship with him,” a chuffed Mr. Biden told reporters, “but we have listened to each other. And he was genuinely listening to my perspective and wasn’t challenging it.”
At other times, Mr. Biden has taken pride in his readiness to speak bluntly to foreign leaders. He famously walked out of a dinner with Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 after</span> a rancorous exchange over corruption.
<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2012,</span> Mr. Biden was assigned to play host to Xi Jinping, then China’s vice president and designated future leader, when he visited the United States. Toasting Mr. Xi at a Valentine’s Day lunch, Mr. Biden ran through a litany of grievances, from Chinese theft of intellectual property to human rights abuses.
“Cooperation, as you and I have spoken about, can only be mutually beneficial if the game is fair,” Mr. Biden said as Mr. Xi looked on.
On a trip to China the following year, Mr. Biden publicly criticized China for refusing to say if it would renew the visas of American correspondents and for blocking the websites of American-based news media. Several years later, China expelled correspondents for The New York Times and other publications.
Speaking as a president, to be sure, is different than as vice president. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">During his trip to Greece <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span></span></span> Mr. Biden ruminated about the risks of commenting on the fiscal tensions between Greece and the European Union.
</span>“You know, in the good old days when I was a senator, I was my own man,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the time. “I could just tell you my views. But now whatever I say is attributed to the administration.”
“I finally learned that,” said the man who now leads his own administration. “It took me about six months, but I got it down.”

27000,"<h3>Ford to cut most car models in North America over the next four years</h3>DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it will shed most of its North American car lineup as part of broad plan to save money and make the company more competitive in a fast-changing marketplace.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The changes include getting rid of all cars in the region during the next four years except for the Mustang sports car and a compact Focus crossover vehicle, CEO Jim Hackett said as the company released first-quarter earnings.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The decision, which Hackett said was due to declining demand and profitability, means Ford will no longer sell the Fusion midsize car, Taurus large car, CMax hybrid compact and Fiesta subcompact in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Exiting most of the car business comes as the U.S. market continues a dramatic shift toward trucks and SUVs.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Ford could also exit or restructure low-performing areas of its business, executives said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The company has found <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $11.5 billion</span> in cost cuts and efficiencies, bringing the total <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $25.5 billion</span> expected <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by<span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span></span> Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters.</span> Savings will come from engineering, product development, marketing, materials and manufacturing. The company previously <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">predicted $14 billion</span> in cuts <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2022.</span>
One-third of Ford’s belt-tightening will come by the end <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020,</span> Shanks said.
“We’re starting to understand what we need to do and making clear decisions there,” Hackett said.
Ford also promised to raise its operating profit margin <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.2 percent</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8 percent</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020,</span> two years earlier than a previous forecast. That includes <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 10 percent</span> pretax margin in North America.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company said its first-quarter net income <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 9 percent</span> due largely to a lower income tax rate.
</span>Ford <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">made $1.74 billion</span> from January through March, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 43 cents</span> per share, compared <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $1.59 billion</span>, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 40 cents</span> per share a year ago. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Revenue <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7 percent</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $41.96 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Earnings and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Analysts polled by FactSet <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 41 cents</span> per share on revenue <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $36.78 billion</span>.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">As usual, North America drove Ford’s profits for the quarter with pretax earnings <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.9 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Pretax automotive earnings <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell $443 million</span> <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.7 billion</span>, mainly due to higher metals costs such as steel and aluminum.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Investors reacted favorably to the earnings.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Ford stock rose <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3 percent</span> in after-hours trading Wednesday <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $11.40.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Through the close of regular-session trading Wednesday, it has fallen <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11 percent</span> so far this year.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The cost savings will come by optimizing digital marketing and discounts on vehicles, as well as putting multiple vehicles on five flexible global architectures in the next few years.</span> The company currently builds vehicles on nine platforms that aren’t as flexible.
Shanks said Ford is “unleashing the creativity of the teams to challenge norms, challenge conventions.” Cuts and efficiencies are not done yet, he said.
Ford will <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cut $5 billion</span> from capital spending <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2019 to</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022,</span> reducing it <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $34 billion</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $29 billion</span>. The company will spend less on low-performing areas such as cars. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">It identified Lincoln as a low-performing area but Shanks said sales are growing and the brand is not in jeopardy.</span> More capital will be allocated to higher performing areas such as trucks and sport utilities, he said.
Lower-performing areas will be targeted for restructuring and some areas could be targeted for “disposition,” Shanks said. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Shanks defined disposition as a different business model, efficiency improvements, exiting or downsizing.</span> “Whatever it takes,” he said.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Shanks wouldn’t say if employees would be cut but said nothing is off the table.
</span>Executives talked about the need to further improve operations in Europe and South America.
“We’ll restructure as necessary and we’ll be decisive,” Hackett said.

65149,"<h3>China Sends Yuan to Fresh Six-Month Low</h3>China Sends Yuan to Fresh Six-Month Low
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The currency’s value has also started to weaken not just against the dollar, but on a global basis
China’s central bank guided the yuan to its weakest value against the dollar in more than six months Thursday, the latest leg down for the Chinese currency in a slide that has gathered pace this week.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The People’s Bank of China set the dollar’s reference rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.5960 yuan</span>,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 0.6% lower</span> than its value in the previous day’s “fix,” which reflects the previous day’s close and overnight currency moves.</span> That put the yuan at its lowest level against the dollar since Dec.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20.</span>
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The yuan fell further shortly after trading began in mainland China, hitting its weakest value since Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> according to Wind Info.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">In recent action, one dollar <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">bought 6.6167 yuan</span>, putting the Chinese currency on track for a daily loss <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.3%.</span>
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the offshore market, the yuan was little changed from the previous day with one dollar <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buying 6.6192 yuan</span>.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The yuan’s drop accelerated after China and the U.S. escalated threats of trade tariffs in the middle of this month, and got another push Sunday after China’s central bank announced measures to inject more <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $100 billion</span> into the financial system.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The diverging fortunes of the world’s two largest economies argue for a weaker yuan.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates two more times this year due to the strong economy, while recent Chinese data suggest growth is starting to slow and the country’s central bank is likely to loosen policy further.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some analysts have argued China could use a yuan devaluation to fight back against U.S. tariffs on its exports.
</span>Still, Chinese authorities are eager to moderate the pace of the yuan’s depreciation, traders said. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">If the currency slides too quickly, it could spark destabilizing capital outflows that proved hard to tame in the months after the yuan’<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2015 devaluation</span>.
</span>Traders and investors say they are now watching the scale of the yuan’s latest decline in relation to other major currencies. The yuan has <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 1.8% against</span> the dollar this week, outpacing the euro’<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.8% fall</span>, the Japanese yen’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.2% slip</span> and the Korean won’<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 0.8% pullback</span>.
That means the yuan’s value has also started to weaken not just against the dollar, but on a global basis. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The dollar, euro, yen and won make up more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60% of</span> the yuan’s trade-weighted basket, which is closely monitored by the Chinese central bank.
</span>The yuan has now <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 1.6% against</span> the greenback this year.

82117,"<h3>Full TPP Text Reveals A Very Bad Deal for America - Breitbart</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is finally public, after years of President Obama’s secret negotiations and a refusal to share the text openly with Congress and the American people.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Unsurprisingly, the document is full of special deals for various U.S. trading partners, foreign corporations, and multinational U.S. businesses.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The TPP is anything but the free trade agreement it purports to be.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The use of the term “free trade,” however, is both a smokescreen to conceal what it really contains and a codeword designed in part to attract the support of Congressional Republicans who lurch zombie-like to support anything labeled free trade, without understanding or even examining the details.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The top Obama Administration trade negotiator, Michael Froman, admitted as much when he insisted the deal cannot be re-negotiated, particularly over the lax rules on importing foreign-made autos and auto parts into the United States.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Apparently, one of America’s biggest economic problems is that Toyota does not sell enough cars and trucks here, and thus does not displace enough American jobs.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The TPP deal allows Toyota a special concession to keep its global supply chain intact.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">TPP lowers the already too low NAFTA parts content standard, and permits Toyota to export vehicles to the United States that contain a large percentage of parts produced in non-TPP countries.</span> And so, other Asian countries such as China, who are not even TPP partners are beneficiaries. Hard to believe, right?
U.S. auto makers and Congressional Democrats are unhappy with the concession and want it renegotiated. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But according to Froman, “Here we <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 12 countries</span>, half of whom we already have free trade agreements with, where every issue is tied to every other issue.</span> You pull the string out on one of these issues and you unravel the whole thing.” Thus Froman admits that the TPP deal is shot through with favoritism and crony arrangements…but it can’t be altered.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">A real free-trade deal could be written on a single sheet of paper, with commitments to remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers of any kind — including the removal of Value Added Taxes (VATs) applied to American exports at the port of entry — and pledges to refrain from the currency manipulation that cheapens and subsidizes the cost of foreign exports.</span> But is the TPP one page — or even two? No, it contains thousands of pages <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 30 chapters</span>, only a few of which deal with tariff reduction.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The other chapters deal with rules and regulations for all manner of things not directly related to trade.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">For example, there are labor and environmental chapters hailed by President Obama as the “most progressive ever.”
</span>But the big problem, whether one is for or against these chapters in principal, is that the president is deceiving us. These chapters are completely unenforceable. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Are we really going to have a fleet of labor rights and environmental inspectors cruising around Vietnam, checking to make sure that every last factory is being fair to its workers and not polluting?</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Or tramping through the jungles of Malaysia to make sure that the government has put an end to the human trafficking and forced labor camps?</span> No, it’s just not humanly possible.
Incidentally, there are two major missed opportunities within the TPP. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And these have to do with the United States not using a Value Added Tax (VAT) and not manipulating its currency.</span> Froman claims to have <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cut 18,000 tariffs</span> in the TPP, but he has completely neglected the most significant tariff of all — foreign VAT taxation. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">All of the other TPP countries (except tiny Brunei) utilize a VAT tax system.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">This is a major trade barrier that imposes a direct tax on U.S. exports, but it is completely unaddressed in the TPP.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As for currency manipulation, the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and is freely traded in markets throughout the world.</span> However, a significant number of TPP countries manipulate their currencies to give their goods a competitive advantage over American products.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But in the TPP, there are only side agreements to discuss currency manipulation via reporting requirements and consultative mechanisms.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">What these side deals mean is that a country can continue to intervene in currency markets, and then the U.S. can discuss the matter — without the ability to do anything about it.</span> That is not a concession or an “extremely meaningful” accomplishment, as Froman has said. It is a surrender — at a time when the U.S. could have addressed the problem.
<span id=""20"" class=""red"">The TPP is being touted as giving a big boost to the American economy.</span> That’s the rationale for doing the deal in the first place, right?
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">But there is no economic study or model that shows any big net benefit to the United States.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">There is one Peterson Institute study, cited by the U.S. Trade Representative, that shows a <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">minimal 0.4 percent</span> gain for the American economy <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025.</span></span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">That’s hardly enough to start reducing our immense and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">growing $18 trillion</span> national debt.</span> And two U.S. Department of Agriculture studies show no net gain in agriculture from the TPP. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Why sign the agreement if it doesn’t help with the national debt?</span> Two words: Special Interests.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ultimately, the TPP is a complex series of rules and regulations intended to manage the economic relations between <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 nations</span> party to the agreement.</span> And its meticulous design serves to benefit each country’s “national champion” companies and industries, with the big winners in the U.S. being the major Wall Street banks, insurance companies, and multinational manufacturer-outsourcers.
One big example of this complex hypocrisy: The TPP has, in addition <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 main</span> chapters, a total <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 58 side</span> agreements (called “side letters.”) <span id=""26"" class=""red"">And Japan alone <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">possesses 14 of</span> these side letters, with each one laying out special conditions for Japanese participation and special deals for Japanese economic sectors.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Free trade?</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Hardly!
Republicans allegedly hate regulatory regimes — but apparently are okay with them if they are done on an international scale under the rubric of free trade.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">What’s wrong with this picture and party?

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Prices have spiked during the recovery from the pandemic recession as Americans have ramped up spending on goods such as cars, furniture and appliances.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Those increased purchases have clogged ports and warehouses and exacerbated supply shortages of semiconductors and other parts.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Gas prices, while declining a bit from November to December, have surged in the past year, in part because Americans have driven more in recent months after having cut back on travel and commuting earlier in the pandemic.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Labor Department reported Wednesday that excluding volatile food and gas prices, so-called core prices <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 0.6% from</span> November to December, slightly more than <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 0.5% increase</span> from October to November.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Measured year over year, core prices <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 5.5% in</span> December, the fastest such increase <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1991.</span>
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Rising prices have wiped out the healthy pay increases that many Americans have been receiving, making it harder for households, especially lower-income families, to afford basic expenses.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Poll show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern, making clear the political threat it poses to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">A significant portion of consumer inflation is still being driven by pandemic-driven mismatches between demand and supply.</span> Used car costs <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 3.5% from</span> November to December and have soared more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 37% compared</span> with a year ago. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">With new car production restrained by shortages of semiconductors, consumers have snapped up used cars, forcing up their costs.
Shortages at U.S. grocery stores have also grown more acute in recent weeks as new problems, like the omicron variant and severe weather, have compounded the supply chain struggles and labor shortages that have plagued retailers since the coronavirus pandemic erupted.

Updated Oct.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 1</span>:08 pm ET

Millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure after the housing crash hit six years ago.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now, some of those families are back in the housing market.</span> Call them the ""boomerang"" buyers.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is difficult to quantify the exact number of boomerang buyers, but real-estate agents, mortgage brokers and home builders all say a significant number of new buyers are families and individuals who went through foreclosure as recently as three years ago, the time period that buyers who defaulted on a mortgage must typically wait before becoming eligible for a mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

</span>On a recent conference call with investors, Stuart Miller, chief executive of Miami-based home builder Lennar Corp., said the company was seeing more people ""coming out of the penalty box."" At Cornerstone Communities, a San Diego home builder, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 20 of</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 closings</span> they have had this year came from buyers who have been through a foreclosure or short sale, estimates Ure Kretowicz, the company's chief executive.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">""It's more than incremental business, that's for sure,"" adds Dan Klinger, president of K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, the mortgage arm of builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">With growing interest from these formerly delinquent buyers, K. Hovnanian provides its sales staff with a flier with industry guidelines listing the mortgage-eligibility rules for all types of derogatory events, from foreclosure to bankruptcy filings.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">""The industry is saying, 'Pay your dues and then get back into the market,' "" Mr. Klinger says.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Using the three-year benchmark it takes to get an FHA-guaranteed loan, in this year's second quarter there <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 729,000 households</span> that were foreclosed upon during the bust that are now eligible to apply for an FHA mortgage, up <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 285,000 in</span> the second quarter <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011,</span> according to an analysis of foreclosure data by Moody's Analytics.</span> The company projects that number will grow <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.5 million</span> by the first quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014.</span>

Typical boomerang buyers are people like April Del Rosario, who purchased her first home <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 when</span> she <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 24 years</span> old. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Newly married and unsure of what terms such as adjustable-rate mortgage meant, Ms. Del Rosario and her husband <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $315,000 for</span> a two-bedroom condominium in San Diego's Mission Valley area, a location they picked because it was central to their jobs.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2,600 monthly</span> mortgage payment was already a struggle, but when the mortgage rate was adjusted higher and Ms. Del Rosario became pregnant, the couple was overwhelmed.</span> They lost the home to foreclosure <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span>

""We were really young and stupid,"" she says. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">""All of a sudden, our already really expensive mortgage was going to go up.</span> I was pregnant and everything was just bad timing on our part.<span id=""10"" class=""red"">""

Three years later, the couple is back in the market.</span> The Del Rosarios were recently approved for a loan for <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $280,000 home</span> in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, which, when it is completed in January, will have three bedrooms and a two-car garage. Instead of proximity to work, they picked the location based on its school district and their desire to live there a long time. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">And while they now must <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $300 a</span> month in mortgage insurance, the family's income has grown, and their total mortgage payment is still a little lower than before, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $2,400.</span></span> ""We're trying to be really conservative. We just want to have a nice place for our son,"" she says.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">There is a web of rules for when and how people who have lost homes to foreclosure or short sales or have gone through a bankruptcy can become eligible for a new mortgage.</span> It typically takes three years after a foreclosure or short sale for a buyer to qualify for an FHA-backed loan. In many cases, it takes just one year after a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</span> discharge, according to the agency.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac require a wait period of as much as seven years after a foreclosure or short sale before a consumer can become eligible for a conventional mortgage, though some short sellers can purchase again after as little as two years.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Becoming eligible for a new mortgage doesn't mean that buyers will necessarily qualify for one.</span> Lenders still require borrowers to have strong credit score and to have been paying their other bills on time.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Until recently, many of the people who had lost their home to foreclosure or short sale have rented homes, leaving many economists and industry watchers to wonder if the nation would become more of a renter society.</span> In the second quarter, the national home-ownership rate came in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 65.5%,</span> down <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 65.9% a</span> year earlier <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 69.2% in</span> the second quarter <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2004.</span> Each percentage-point decline represents about one million households.

But as rental rates continue rising—they <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbed 0.8% in</span> the third quarter to a national average <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1,090 per</span> month, according to Reis Inc.—homeownership is increasingly becoming cheaper than renting.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">That is part of what enticed Ronda Martinez,<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 39,</span> back in to the market.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2007,</span> she and her husband, Mark, let their two-story,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $430,000 home</span> in Perris, Calif., go into foreclosure when they were unable to sell it when required to move to Phoenix for a job.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Later, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> she was laid off from her job at a real-estate-data company.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Since then, the family has repaired their finances, and Mrs. Martinez found a new job.</span> This month, the family is closing on <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $150,000 home</span> in Phoenix that has five bedrooms and a pool in the back.

""Initially people are upset and think, 'I'll never buy again,' "" she said. But ""there's no reason to give up on owning.""

14424,"<h3>U.S. Nears Shutdown as House Votes To Delay Health Law</h3>Updated Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:53 am ET

WASHINGTON—The U.S. government moved to within hours of its first shutdown <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1996,</span> as House Republicans redoubled their drive early Sunday to delay the new health care law and Senate Democrats stood firm against changing the law as a condition of funding federal departments.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The standoff left little prospect that Congress could reach agreement on terms for funding the government by midnight Monday, when the current fiscal year expires.</span> A shutdown would leave essential services operating but prompt federal agencies to suspend many functions and furlough hundreds of thousands of workers.

On a 231-192 vote, the House early Sunday passed a one-year delay of the health law, often called Obamacare, and attached it to a plan to fund the government through Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15.</span> The legislation now goes to the Senate. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">It also includes a provision repealing a tax on medical devices intended to help finance the health law, which the House approved on a 248-174 vote.

</span>But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), in a statement issued hours before the House took up the bill, pledged to strip out the health provisions. He denounced the GOP vote as ""pointless"" and declared the impasse to be back at ""<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Square 1.</span>""

The White House said that if the House bill reached President Barack Obama, who championed the health law, he would veto it.

The stare-down between the two chambers intensified as Democratic aides said Mr. Reid had no plans to call the Senate into session before its planned Monday afternoon return. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That will be just hours before government funding for many federal functions runs out with the end of the fiscal year.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The next step is unclear, as no official business on Capitol Hill is planned for Sunday.</span> There was no sign negotiations were being scheduled among congressional leaders, and no lawmakers—from graybeards to backbenchers—said they were optimistic that a shutdown would be averted.

In a blunt acknowledgment of that prospect, the House early Sunday also approved legislation to ensure that military personnel would be paid in the event of a shutdown.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Republicans have been determined to use the budget deadline as leverage in their long-running battle to undercut the health care law, which reaches a landmark moment on Tuesday, when one of its most important components takes effect.</span> On that day, people can begin to sign up for health insurance policies through new online marketplaces.

""The American people don't want a government shutdown, and they don't want Obamacare,"" House Republican leaders said in a joint statement about their government-funding bill. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">""We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown.</span>""

""Maybe they'll panic and do the right thing for once,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) said of the Senate. ""Republicans are extremely unified at this point.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) was under pressure from conservative House members to carry the fight against the health law as long as possible.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""Pushing until the very, very last minute has been one of the mainstays of the House GOP's negotiating strategy on budget issues,"" said Stan Collender a former aide to the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a budget specialist at Qorvis Communications.</span> If House Republicans eventually accede to a simple funding bill, shorn of changes to the new health law, it won't likely be until the 11th hour on Monday, he said.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Some Republicans held hope that the Senate would agree at least to repeal the medical devices tax, giving the House GOP a victory.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">In votes earlier this year, senators from both parties backed a repeal, but Democrats were unlikely to do so as part of the current budget fight.

</span>Democrats criticized House Republican leaders for moving to pass measures so close to the deadline that were bound to fail in the Senate. The longest-serving member of the House, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) had particularly harsh words.

""This once-deliberative body has been taken over by knaves and know-nothings, content with putting partisan politics ahead of the American people,'' Mr. Dingell said.

He added: ""I believe that this current Congress would be incapable of passing the Ten Commandments or even the Lord's Prayer, and today's actions have only further galvanized that belief.""

<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 800,000 of</span> more than two million federal workers were furloughed in <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1995 shutdown</span>, with fewer workers affected in a following shutdown that stretched into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 1996.</span> The number who would be furloughed this time is unclear and would vary by agency. The Pentagon has said <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 400,000 civilian</span> defense workers would be sent home.

Postal and air traffic control services would continue, and Social Security checks would be mailed. But many federal functions would be suspended, such as surveillance of flu and other diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National parks and museums would close.

Some Republicans said that the bill taken up by the House on Saturday night was unlikely to break the stalemate. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the Senate, Democratic leaders can strike the health care delay and medical device tax amendments with a 51-vote majority, then send the funding bill back to the House.

</span>Lawmakers weren't sure what Mr. Boehner's next step would be in that case.

The House could pass the Senate's funding measure, stripped of provisions related to the health law, and send it to Mr. Obama, as the Senate has insisted. Lawmakers could also buy more time by passing a short extension of funding, perhaps for a week.

But Republicans said they might take another stab at amending the spending bill and dare the Senate to let the government shut down. At the same time, some of the GOP caucus's more centrist members worried about the rapidly shrinking window of time. ""I hope it works, but it may not,'' said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.).

The House bill emerged midday from an uncommon Saturday meeting of the House Republican Conference, where GOP leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers agreed on the details of their bill.

Many House Republicans say their party would likely bear more of the public blame if the government is forced into a partial shutdown. But some argued Saturday that wasn't a reason to shift course.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Republicans said they believed that economic benefits flowing from a repeal of the medical-device tax would offset the loss of <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $29 billion</span> in revenue <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 10 years</span>, the sum that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the tax will generate.

</span>And some Republicans argued that their proposal to delay the health-care law by one year represented a compromise between their earlier push to defund the law and Democrats' desire to keep it unchanged.

""Just delay this thing for one year—it's really not too much to ask,"" said Rep. Trey Radel (R., Fla.).

Democrats, by contrast, saw little compromise in the House Republican plan. ""It's their way or the highway, and the highway leads over the cliff,"" said Rep. Sandy Levin (D., Mich.).

In the vote to delay the health law, two Republicans broke from their party to oppose a delay. They were New York Reps. Chris Gibson and Richard Hanna.

Two Democrats voted in favor of the one-year delay: Reps. Jim Matheson (D., Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D., N.C.).

The White House and congressional Democrats are opposed to delaying the health law but have indicated they would entertain changes to improve the bill. But they have firmly opposed talking about even modest changes as part of negotiating the government funding bill.

91844,"<h3>Fed Minutes Show Most Officials Favored Slowing Rate Rises Soon</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">WASHINGTON—Most Federal Reserve officials thought they should slow the pace of interest-rate increases after approving <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.75</span>-percentage-point rate rise at their meeting earlier this month to battle high inflation.
</span>Their discussion at the meeting, described in minutes of the gathering released Wednesday, suggests they could downshift to a rate rise <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.5 percentage</span> point, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 50 basis</span> points, at their meeting next month.
“A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would soon be appropriate,” the minutes said.
Officials approved the fourth consecutive supersize rate increase at their Nov. 1-2 meeting, bringing their benchmark rate to a range <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 3.75% and</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">They are boosting rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s to reduce inflation that is running near a 40-year high.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">All 19 officials</span> at the meeting supported the decision to raise rates this month and broadly agreed they needed to keep lifting them, the minutes showed. Still, the discussion revealed some were more anxious about the possibility of overdoing the increases, while others worried they might not be making enough progress to warrant a downshift.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Some from the first camp said the risks were rising that the Fed’s rate increases might ultimately “exceed what was required to bring inflation back” to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% goal</span></span>.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A few also warned that continuing to raise rates <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 0.75</span>-point increments “increased the risk of instability or dislocations in the financial system,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">A small minority believed it might be better to wait to slow increases until rates were “more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly,” the minutes said.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">At their September meeting, most Fed officials projected that they would raise the benchmark federal-funds to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 4.6% early</span> next year.
</span>Officials didn’t release new rate projections at their meeting this month. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2 news</span> conference that if they had, they would have been higher given recent strength in the labor market and high inflation readings.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The minutes said that officials thought that high inflation and the strong labor market would call for raising the benchmark federal-funds rate next year to a level “somewhat higher than they had previously expected.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Fed is raising rates to combat inflation by slowing the economy through tighter financial conditions—such as higher borrowing costs, lower stock prices and a stronger dollar—which typically curb demand.
</span>The central bank’s staff saw a U.S. recession next year “as almost as likely” as their baseline projection of weak growth, the minutes showed. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">That represented a downgrade of the economic outlook due to the tightening of financial conditions that had occurred this fall.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Is the Fed taking the right steps to combat inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.
In more recent public comments, officials have broadly endorsed approving <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.5</span>-point increase at their Dec. 13-14 meeting as they acknowledged the risks of causing an unnecessarily deep downturn.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">“A rate hike <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50 basis</span> points would still be significant,” said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in a speech earlier this month.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Fed governor Christopher Waller last week said the central bank could still raise rates aggressively in coming months even if officials reduce the size of their increases <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.5 point</span>.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">He compared the Fed’s task to a pilot finding a comfortable cruising altitude after takeoff.</span> “As the policy rate gets higher, the stronger is the case for slowing the rate of ascent while continuing to climb,” he said.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">This summer and fall, several Fed officials suggested they would want to see evidence that inflation is declining toward <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% goal</span></span> before slowing or stopping rate increases.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">But at a press conference on Nov.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span> Mr. Powell suggested a sequence of slower inflation readings had never been “the appropriate test” for slowing or halting rate rises.
</span>Instead, officials including Mr. Powell have shifted the focus toward how high rates might have to rise. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Investors in interest-rate futures markets expect the Fed to raise the fed-funds rate to slightly <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 5% by</span> next March, according to CME Group.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Consumer prices rose more slowly in October than in recent months, according to the Labor Department.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.3% from</span> September, the smallest monthly gain in one year, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6.3% on</span> a year-over-year basis, down <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.6%.</span>

23424,"<h3>Crude Slump, Pipeline Expansion Mark End of U.S. Oil-Train Boom</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Crude Slump, Pipeline Expansion Mark End of U.S. Oil-Train Boom
As more pipelines reach shale regions, producers have a cheaper way to move their oil to market
The oil-train boom is waning almost as quickly as it began.
</span>Rail became a major way to move crude after companies began unlocking new bounties of oil from shale formations, with volumes rising from almost nothing <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 to</span> more than one million barrels a day <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2014,</span> according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">But those numbers began falling after oil prices started tumbling two years ago, and aren’t projected to recover anytime soon.</span> In April, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 430,000 barrels</span> of oil rode the rails each day, according to the latest federal figures.

</span></span></span></span>Some of the decline came from a drop in U.S. oil production, but oil and rail executives say the drop-off may be permanent.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“At least some portion, and it could be a pretty large portion,” of the rail business won’t return, said Union Pacific Corp. UNP -0.11 % Chief Executive Lance Fritz.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">More pipelines have begun reaching North Dakota and other shale regions, giving producers a cheaper way to move their oil to market.
</span>Also, a string of fiery crude-freight-train derailments—including one in Lac Mégantic, Quebec, that <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 47 people</span> in 2013—have prompted a host of new and expensive regulations, and fueled opposition that has helped delay major rail projects on the West Coast, where a dearth of pipelines makes rail useful. Regulators have mandated new safer tank cars, and older tank cars are being phased out—adding to future costs for transporting oil.
The changes are evident in North Dakota, once the epicenter of the crude-by-rail trend. Oil output from the state’s Bakken Shale formation has fallen <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 180,000 barrels</span> a day from <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2014 peak</span>. Meanwhile, pipeline takeaway capacity has more than doubled <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span>
EOG Resources Inc., <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">EOG 0.97 </span>% one of the first oil companies to see the potential for trains to relieve pipelines, opened its first rail loading terminal in Stanley, N.D., <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009.</span> But that terminal hasn’t loaded a train in more than a year, according to Genscape, a data provider that tracks activity at U.S. rail terminals.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">“New pipeline infrastructure has been put in place to move significant volumes of oil to market,” an EOG spokeswoman said.
</span>Enough pipeline capacity is coming online to replace all of the current volume BNSF Railway Co. is shipping out of North Dakota, said David Garin, the railroad’s group vice president of industrial products.
BNSF used to transport as many <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 12 trains</span> daily filled with crude primarily from North Dakota’s Bakken Shale, carrying <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% of</span> all rail traffic out of the area. Now it is down to about five a day.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Will this business be back <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 12 trains</span> a day?</span> Probably not,” said Mr. Garin. “Will it be zero? Probably not.”
Even at its height <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> crude-by-rail accounted for less <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2% of</span> total rail volumes, according to Association of American Railroads data. But its decline threatens what was once viewed as a sizable driver of growth for the railroad industry, one that many rail companies, along with oil and gas producers, made investments to support.
<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2010 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 89 terminals</span> were built or expanded in the U.S. and Canada to load crude on trains, and nearly as many to offload it, according to consulting firm RBN Energy LLC.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The oil pouring out of U.S. fields was so much cheaper—more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $20 a</span> barrel below international benchmark prices at times—that refineries were eager to pay higher rail shipping costs in exchange for some of it.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">New pipelines have helped shrink that price difference by allowing the landlocked oil to reach market.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">And the U.S. has lifted a ban on crude exports, which allows American crude to be sent abroad freely and is expected to help keep U.S. and international crude prices more closely aligned.
</span>Now oil trains are competing against tanker ships carrying foreign crude. Analysts say rail deliveries are likely to fall even further once shipping contracts signed during the boom expire in the coming months.
There could soon be more than enough space to carry away all Bakken oil through pipelines now in the works. <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phillips 66 PSX</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.24 </span>% is partnering with pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ETP 0.05 </span>% LP to develop a pair of pipelines that will bring North Dakota crude to Illinois and then down to Texas.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The endeavor, which will cost close <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $5 billion</span>, is expected to take a major bite out of oil train traffic, even though the pipelines will ultimately bring oil to the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico, rather than to the East and West coasts, where trains have primarily taken it.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Phillips 66 said</span> earlier this year it may still be cheaper to take that oil and put it on a barge for delivery by sea to the coasts than to send it directly there by train.

84559,"<h3>Virginia company giving 10 workers a chance at a year’s pay with vaccine lottery</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">A Reston-based IT company is giving its employees a chance to win a year’s pay for the price of a coronavirus vaccine.

</span>Leidos Inc., a government contractor with a global workforce <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 40,000,</span> has set <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">aside $1 million</span> to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reward 10 randomly</span> selected workers through its vaccine lottery. The company aims to ramp up its inoculation rates, which like the rest of the country have slowed down.

Though vaccine supplies are plentiful, more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 in</span><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 U</span>.S. adults still aren’t fully vaccinated, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sixty-seven percent had gotten at least one dose as of <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 3,</span> which remains shy of President Biden’s goal <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 70 percent</span> — a crucial benchmark toward reaching herd immunity — by the Fourth of July.

“Our company, like the country at large, has seen a bit of a slowdown in the number of people actually getting the vaccine,” Roger Krone, chairman and chief executive of Leidos, told The Post. “We see a huge need to gently push people who are on the fence, and give them one more reason to do it.”

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Though Leidos has been spared from the widespread outbreaks seen in the grocery, meatpacking and other industries, the company said it has lost eight employees to the pandemic.</span> One of them, Keith Redding, was among the first to die of the virus in the D.C. area. A company foundation in his name has <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">distributed $1.8 million</span> to the families of other coronavirus victims.

But as companies like Leidos prepare for a full return to in-person work, managers are working to guard their factory floors and office hallways against becoming points of transmission for a virus that has killed more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 604,000 Americans</span>.

The fast-moving delta variant, which poses special risk to unvaccinated people, has upped the ante. The nation’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has called it the “greatest threat” to ending the U.S. pandemic. The delta variant also moved the Biden administration to activate “surge response” teams that will deploy additional expertise and supplies to hot spots.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has confirmed that federal law, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, does not preclude companies from making vaccinations mandatory in the workforce.</span> Some companies have done so, occasionally stirring controversy.

Other are opting for the carrot over the stick. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Retail and grocery chains including Trader Joe’s, Aldi and Dollar General have used various incentives to encourage vaccinations.</span> In most cases, the incentives add up to a few hundred dollars or a day off.

Coming off a profitable year, executives from <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $14.5 billion</span> company wanted to craft an incentive program that would make more of a splash. Krone and other executives said they chose a lottery after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), announced that he would offer <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">five $1 million</span> prizes to vaccinated state residents, along with four-year college scholarships for five vaccinated Ohioans younger <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 18.</span>

Five days after its rollout, the Ohio Department of Health announced the Vax-a-Million campaign had driven <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28 percent</span> increase in the vaccination rates of <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">residents 16 and</span> older. Other states have also gone the lottery route, including Maryland, Oregon and California.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Leidos’s lottery will award each employee the equivalent of one year of salary.</span> Because managers are excluded from the sweepstakes, the company estimates its outlay will be <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1 million</span>

The company announced the initiative last Monday, along with a call for sign-ups, and has already enrolled more than a third of its workforce. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Employees are not required to show proof of vaccination when they sign up.

</span>Those with a legitimate reason to opt out of the vaccine, such as a medical condition, can still enter the sweepstakes without getting inoculated, an executive said. But <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 winners</span> will be required to show a vaccine card before receiving their lump-sum payment.

“In the end, in a time of crisis, what people are about is providing safety, health and security for their family,” Krone said. “I can’t wait to celebrate our first few winners.”"

“We are open to discussions on structural issues,” said a White House spokeswoman. “We are looking to China to address these concerns” and to bring “concrete proposals.”

The talks would be the first in more than two months. During that time, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods and Beijing responded with levies of its own. Officials on both sides have said that their counterparts seemed uninterested in concessions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The dispute has hit China’s stock markets and currency while largely sparing U.S. markets.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Now, trade analysts said, U.S. plans to move ahead in coming weeks with penalties <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> more in Chinese goods are raising the stakes.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">“The talks are necessary to avoid a complete rupture of China-U.S. relations, although the chance of coming to an agreement is low,” said Mei Xinyu, an analyst at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry and a frequent critic of U.S. trade policy.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The August discussions will be held at a lower level than previous efforts, which were helmed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The talks—to be led by Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass and Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen—are meant to be exploratory, providing a way for both sides to save face should progress prove elusive, said people briefed on the discussions.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Chinese side will also be represented by Finance Vice Minister Liao Min, who is a top aide to Vice Premier Liu He, and Chinese Commerce Ministry Deputy Director Zhao Na.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">The U.S. Treasury has been refining its demands for Beijing, those people said, including lowering tariffs, ending policies that press U.S. firms to transfer technology to Chinese partners and improving market access for foreign companies to reduce what the U.S. calculates is <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $375 billion</span> trade imbalance in China’s favor last year.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Another item on the U.S. agenda, the people say, is persuading Beijing to raise the value of its currency to its pre-dispute level.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The U.S. has complained for years that Beijing manipulates the yuan’s value to help boost its exports.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The currency has fallen <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 10% against</span> the greenback since April, though it briefly rose <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 0.5% Thursday</span> after the news of the coming talks.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">China’s central bank has attributed the yuan’s weakness to market reaction to a strengthening U.S. dollar.

</span>Largely as a result of the falling yuan, Mr. Trump ordered that the prospective tariffs <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> in Chinese goods be raised to as high <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 25% from</span><span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10% so</span> Beijing can’t use devaluation to limit the tariff’s sting.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">U.S. officials have said that in previous talks their Chinese counterparts showed little imagination in addressing American complaints about unfair trade practices.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Chinese officials, meanwhile, have privately said the U.S. demands are too wide-ranging and are ultimately aimed at getting Beijing to dismantle its government-supported economic system.

</span>Divisions within the U.S. government are likely to loom over the coming talks.

Some analysts add that the Chinese side is likely to be wary of promises made by U.S. officials that aren’t directly endorsed by Mr. Trump. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Messrs. Mnuchin and Liu declared a truce in the trade fight in late May only to have Mr. Trump announce shortly afterward a decision to go ahead with tariffs.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">As the Treasury works to restart negotiations with Beijing, the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to hold public hearings starting Monday on <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $200 billion</span></span> in tariffs.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Trump administration’s more hawkish trade advisers argue that Beijing will become more willing to make concessions as the additional tariffs hit.</span> China has said it would respond with additional tariffs.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">These U.S. trade advisers believe China’s economy is weaker than commonly believed and that America’s strengthening economy gives them room to maneuver politically, even if some U.S. industries feel pain from the tariff fight.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The Trump administration is also putting the finishing touches on a plan to compensate farmers for falling prices caused by the trade battle.

</span>Some analysts and lobbyists said differing agendas within the U.S. government and between Washington and Beijing would likely confound progress in the talks.

“This is a waste of time for the two governments, especially China’s. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">If there isn’t a conversation centered around seriously limiting Chinese industrial policy and USTR isn’t representing the U.S., it’s a meaningless discussion,” said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, using an abbreviation for the trade representative.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">David French, a trade lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, a U.S. trade association, said: “I’m not sure the U.S. administration position is clear.</span> It could be difficult for the Chinese to understand what our direction is or what our purpose is with tariffs.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">In its brief statement announcing the talks, China’s Commerce Ministry said Beijing “won’t accept any unilateral trade restrictions.”

</span>If Beijing wants to head off the planned tariffs <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on $200 billion</span></span></span> in goods, some analysts said, it could try promising to buy a large amount of U.S. products. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Chinese officials offered in June to buy <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70 billion</span> in U.S. agriculture and energy goods, falling short of <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $200 billion</span></span> Mr. Trump wanted to reduce the U.S. deficit by.</span> Senior U.S. officials dismissed that offer as hype, arguing that the amount offered was far less <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $70 billion</span>.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">“It would be critically important for China to bring measurable deliverables,” said Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council.

73198,"<h3>Shopping Spree for Wall Street</h3>Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 8</span>:34 pm ET

A flurry of acquisitions announced within hours of each other Thursday, for everything from ketchup to airlines to drug wholesaling, suggests big-time deal-making is back after a nearly six-year absence from Wall Street.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Mergers and acquisitions took a sharp tumble after the financial crisis, as economic uncertainty and paranoia on corporate boards kept deal-making on the sidelines.</span> This year, though, has been different.

<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $40 billion</span>-worth of deals struck Thursday brings the total value of M&A transactions announced since January to <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $160 billion</span>, the fastest start to a year <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2005,</span> according to Dealogic. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">M&A volumes historically follow the lead of the stock market, and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 6.67% increase</span> in the Standard & Poor'<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 500 Index</span> this year suggests more are on the way.

</span>""The dam is burst,"" said James B. Lee, the veteran deal maker who is vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. He is stitching together his own deal: <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $24.4 billion</span> takeover of Dell Inc. by its founder and a private-equity firm. ""The forces were too powerful to hold back forever,"" Mr. Lee said.

In addition to the Heinz deal, the highlights of Thursday's bonanza were <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $11 billion</span> merger between AMR Corp. and US Airways Group; a reworked deal for beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev NV over the divestment of some brands to rival Constellation Brands Inc. <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $4.75 billion</span>; and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc.'<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $2 billion</span> purchase of rival AssuraMed.

M&A bankers are renowned for their optimism, no matter the conditions. But Mr. Lee and others argue that the recent spate of large deals, which also include <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $16 billion</span> merger of cable companies Liberty Global Inc. and Virgin Media Inc., and <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $18.1 billion</span> to be spent by Comcast Corp. to buy General Electric Corp. out of broadcaster NBCUniversal, are more than coincidental timing.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Their argument is this: Companies have largely exhausted the benefits of cutting costs and improving productivity since the recession.</span> They are now looking elsewhere for the level of growth that keeps shareholders happy. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Deals, economic theory goes, are one way.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Business productivity spiked in the aftermath of the recession, as companies cut workers and aggressively pared back costs.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2008 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2009,</span> for instance, productivity surged <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 6%,</span> according to data compiled by the St. Louis Fed.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The rate of productivity increases has slowed considerably since then and at the end <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2012 were</span> less <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1% annually</span>.

</span>The new attitude might be summed up by publicly traded 1-800-FLOWERS.com. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In a Feb.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 conference</span> call with analysts, chief financial officer William E. Shea described how the company's balance sheet had changed <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Back then, he said, the company had <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $130 million</span> of debt.</span> Today, the sum is <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $20 million</span>.

""We're not afraid of making acquisitions,"" Mr. Shea said. ""But

during this past period of time, that wasn't the right thing for us to do... We think we can get organic growth rates moving north of where they are today... And if we can find the right company and strike the right deal, we will do that.<span id=""9"" class=""red"">""

One thing that has changed is an alignment of both credit and stock markets.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> both are rallying at the same time, offering cheap credit to buyers and the prospect of acceptable prices to sellers.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Both the H.J. Heinz Co.'s acquisition and the Dell deal involve large debt packages from banks.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Financial groups are again willing to bankroll deals of such size because bankers are confident they can quickly sell the debt to yield-hungry investors.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Loan investors like large deals, too, because they are easier to buy and sell on the secondary market.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">""To me, this is the sweet spot of the leveraged loan market,"" said Christine McConnell, who <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $11 billion</span> of loan investments at Fidelity Investments.

</span>Few expect a return to the swashbuckling transactions of the late 1990s or mid-2000s, when cheap money, lavish lending by banks and aggressive private equity groups led to some poor acquisition choices.

Since then, activist investors have gained greater sway inside board rooms, often enforcing a sharp discipline on company executives, especially those with a taste for creative deal-making.

The U.S. government also has stepped forward, stopping AT&T Inc.'s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> and, just weeks ago, suing to stop Anheuser-Busch InBev NV'<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $20.1 billion</span> deal to take control of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo SAB.

In the months ahead, two paths seem mostly likely for deal making. The first uses M&A as a bridge between U.S. and foreign markets, with capital flowing into U.S. companies rather than the reverse.

Japan's Softbank Corp. is spending <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $33.4 billion</span> to take over Sprint Nextel Corp. Chinese companies, for instance, spent more <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 billion</span> <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 46 U</span>.S.-bound deals <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span> Investors should also expect more incoming deals via rapidly developing conglomerates in such places as Turkey, South Korea and Indonesia.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">""The sources of capital are global and the fundamental nature of our business is cross-border,"" said Antonio Weiss, global head of investment banking at</span> Lazard Ltd. ""What is happening is a redeployment of capital that has been built up in one region into another.<span id=""16"" class=""red"">""

The second path will be standard industry-rationalizing deals, which may have been contemplated for years but lacked market confidence to complete.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Look especially for activity in energy, real estate and financial services.

</span>Late last year, Avalonbay Communities Inc. <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $15.9 billion</span> on a once-battered real-estate investment trust called Archstone-Smith.

And it seems only a matter of time until greater consolidation comes to Wall Street's own door, as now-stabilized banks find mergers a painful, if inevitable, next step after internal restructuring.

73533,"<h3>Central Banks Move to Drive Down Currencies, Yielding Domino Effect</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Interest-Rate Cuts, Asset Purchases Ricochet Through Foreign-Exchange Markets; ‘Unspoken Currency War Has Broken Out’

Updated Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015 7</span>:28 pm ET

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The central-bank stimulus spree <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015 has</span> the look of a global currency war.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In quick succession, countries representing about a third of the world’s economic output—from the eurozone to China, Australia and Canada—have taken steps that have driven down the value of their currencies.

</span>But if it’s a war, it’s a gentle one so far.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Half the central banks representing the Group <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 developed</span> and large emerging economies, whose top monetary and finance officials meet to discuss the global economy this week in Istanbul, have taken easing steps so far this year.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The moves—mainly in the form of interest-rate cuts but also asset purchases—have ricocheted through foreign-exchange markets, driving the currencies of some countries down and those of others, primarily the U.S., up.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That helps the economies of countries that are easing while complicating life for some central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and creating challenges for exporters, from the U.S. to Switzerland and Denmark.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” David Woo and Vadim Iaralov at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, noting that the magnitude of currency-market swings this year has hit its highest noncrisis level <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 20 years</span>.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Mention of currency war evokes images of countries deliberately trying to force their currencies down to boost exports and curb imports at their neighbors’ expense.</span> By definition, it’s a zero-sum game.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">This is a bit different: Central banks by and large aren’t specifically aiming to achieve a certain—weak—exchange rate, for instance by buying up foreign currencies on the open market, as in currency wars of the past.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They are doing what they think is best for their economies and, if their currencies weaken in response, so much the better.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">With the possible exception of Switzerland, whose economy may be rattled by the sudden surge in the franc after the country’s central bank unexpectedly dropped its currency ceiling against the euro last month, there aren’t any clear victims yet.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Indeed, there’s a positive-sum aspect to these currency wars.</span> As one central bank eases, others are forced to follow suit to offset the upward pressure on their currencies.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Unlike past easy-money campaigns, these latest efforts—from economies totaling <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $36 trillion</span> in annual output—aren’t aimed at addressing financial crises, as with the U.S.-led global effort six years ago.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rather, central banks are taking aim at the risks of too-low inflation and weak economic growth.

</span>The frenzy of easing policies began in Europe, once a center of conservative central banking with Germany’s Bundesbank at its core. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program, mostly government debt, last month that could swell beyond €1 trillion (<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $1.13 trillion</span>) by the fall <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016.</span>

</span>That sent a tidal wave through the continent. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Switzerland responded before the program was even announced last month by abandoning the ceiling it had set on the franc’s level against the euro, as markets widely anticipated the ECB’s move, while Denmark slashed interest rates four times in three weeks.</span> Switzerland and Denmark also accumulated massive amounts of foreign currencies last month to keep a lid on their currencies’ strength. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Sweden and Poland might cut rates in coming weeks, analysts say, and the Czech central bank has said it is ready to take steps to keep its currency weak against the euro.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Europeans have turned the common-sense idea that official interest rates can go only so low on its head.</span> Deposit rates on bank reserves set by the Swiss and Danish central banks are each at -0.75%. The ECB also has a negative deposit rate, at -0.2%, which means banks must pay a fee to park excess cash with their central bank.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">“We are sort of testing the limits,” said Ángel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

</span>These policies have brought bond yields to rock-bottom levels and pushed equities higher. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The hope is that all this global easing will bolster global demand.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">But there are doubts as to how much more stimulus officials can get from asset markets.

</span>That leaves currencies as the main transmission channel. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">In an era of weak global growth and very low inflation, central bankers can take aggressive currency-weakening measures such as printing money or pushing rates into negative territory without having to worry about any inflationary consequences.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">That makes exports cheaper in economies with looser monetary policies, and more expensive in those that are holding the line.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Even if recent measures haven’t been directly aimed at currencies, “the impact of domestically oriented policies naturally has an impact on the exchange rate,” said Hung Tran, managing director at the Institute of International Finance.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The U.S. is already seeing the negative effects of a stronger dollar, with trade slicing one percentage point from fourth-quarter growth.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Still, its economy is cranking out jobs at a rapid pace.

</span>With Europe still wrestling with stagnation and political turmoil in Greece, and growth softening in key emerging markets such as China, the pressure on central banks will likely remain intense.

11356,"<h3>Inside the special counsel’s long hunt to uncover whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia</h3>On a cloudy day in early November, the last of conservative writer Jerome Corsi’s six marathon interviews with the office of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was about to begin. Sitting in a building in Southwest Washington, three prosecutors assigned to his case opened with a lecture.
For more than two months, they had been chasing tantalizing leads offered by Corsi, an associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone who had told them that the longtime GOP operative sought a back channel to WikiLeaks during <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span>.
They had dispatched FBI agents around the country to interview potential witnesses, expending valuable government money and precious time — only to find themselves unable to untangle Corsi’s assertions that Stone knew in advance that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
“No lies, hunches, wishes,” prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky lectured Corsi that day as they sat in a windowless conference room, according to notes taken by Corsi’s lawyer, David Gray. “Hopes do not equal facts. Don’t tell us what you think we want to hear.”
The Yale-educated former Supreme Court clerk pleaded with Corsi: It was “vitally important” that Corsi provide the “truth only,” Zelinsky said.
The trio of top prosecutors had spent weeks coaxing, cajoling and admonishing the conspiracy theorist as they pressed him to stick to facts and not reconstruct stories. At times, they had debated the nature of memory itself.
Once again that day, however, Corsi struggled to answer clearly questions about Stone and WikiLeaks — closing the door on an exhausting final chapter of Mueller’s nearly two-year hunt to determine whether anyone in Trump’s world had coordinated with Russia.
The investigation took the special counsel’s team down several meandering paths, propelled by discoveries of unusual interactions between Trump associates and Russians. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had shared internal information with an employee assessed by the FBI to have Russian intelligence ties.</span> Foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was tipped off that the Russians had thousands of Clinton’s emails. Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who he hoped would offer damaging information about Clinton.
[Mueller’s report paints a portrait of a campaign intrigued by Russian overtures]
In the end, Mueller’s final report, a redacted version of which was released by Attorney General William P. Barr on Thursday, laid out new details about the Russian effort to influence <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>campaign</span></span> through social media and the hacking of Democratic emails, and it offered a rich portrait of Trump’s efforts as president to undermine the investigation and mislead the public.
The 448-page report also revealed the outcome of the long endeavor to determine the relationship between Trump associates and Russia: some unanswered mysteries, a lot of dead ends and, ultimately, a conclusion that the contacts they found did not establish a criminal conspiracy.
Stone has not been charged with serving as a conduit to WikiLeaks, which disseminated material stolen by Russians.
Instead, he was indicted in January for lying to Congress about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and has vehemently denied having any knowledge of what WikiLeaks held and the group’s exact plans. Stone has also denounced Corsi’s account as lies.
Corsi announced in November that he had rejected a deal to plead guilty to false statements and accused the special counsel’s office of trying to bully him into lying. He has not been charged with any crime.
A reconstruction of the laborious effort by Mueller’s team to determine whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia shows why it was often a maddeningly difficult task.
Their witnesses were not ideal. A few key players, prosecutors would contend, lied in interviews. Many were loyal to the president and echoed his rhetoric that Mueller’s team was acting in bad faith. Some used encrypted applications with disappearing messages that could not be reviewed. Others were overseas, unreachable to American investigators.
In some cases, their statements were only loosely tethered to the facts.
This account is based on interviews with people who interacted with Mueller’s team, court documents and new details laid out in the special counsel’s report. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.
It was the first item in the order that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein issued in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2017 when</span> he appointed Mueller as special counsel.
As part of his charge, Mueller would take over a preexisting FBI investigation into “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”
The inquiry had begun in late <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>after</span> the Australian government contacted the FBI about Papadopoulos. Over drinks at a bar in London, the young Trump aide had confided to an Australian diplomat that the Russian government had thousands of Clinton emails that could damage her candidacy.
By the time Mueller was appointed, the FBI had interviewed Papadopoulos and, according to him, tried unsuccessfully to get him to travel to London and surreptitiously record a conversation with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who told him about the Clinton emails. In <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2017 interview</span> with a British newspaper, Mifsud denied knowledge of the emails.
The FBI had also obtained a secret court order allowing them to monitor the communications of former Trump adviser Carter Page, who had traveled to Moscow during the heat of the campaign and interacted there with a Russian government official.
The work came against the backdrop of the publication of a research dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Clinton’s campaign, which claimed that Trump had engaged in a knowing conspiracy with Russia, which Trump dismissed as false.
The special counsel moved quickly on several fronts.
Weeks after Mueller was appointed, the FBI sent a search warrant to Google, scooping up Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s Gmail messages dating back to <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> court records show. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">His emails began to help investigators uncover the extent of his efforts to develop a Trump Tower project in Moscow — an attempt that persisted through much of the campaign, even as Trump publicly denied he had business ties in Russia, court filings show.
</span>[‘We will be in Moscow’: The story of Trump’s 30-year quest to expand his brand to Russia]
By July, Mueller’s team was delving into Trump Jr.’s meeting the previous summer with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, which had also been attended by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort.
They started with a potentially neutral witness: the interpreter, interviewing him just four days after the New York Times broke the news of the meeting, according to the report.
Russian-born Anatoli Samochornov described to investigators what unfolded in the 20-minute meeting: Veselnitskaya raised the topic of Democratic donors who she alleged had broken Russian law. One of her associates then brought up a U.S. sanctions law against Russia and a ban on American adoptions of Russian children that the Kremlin had imposed in retaliation. Trump Jr. said there was little his father could do to address the issue, but said it could be revisited if Trump were elected.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2017,</span> prosecutors interviewed Ike Kaveladze, an employee of Aras Agalarov, the Russian billionaire who had hosted Trump’s Miss Universe pageant <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 in</span> Moscow and requested the meeting through his son.
</span>“They asked very targeted questions,” said Kaveladze, who had attended the meeting as the Agalarov representative. “I realized they had significant knowledge of the topic.”
Mueller’s team interviewed everyone who attended the meeting except Veselnitskaya, who is in Russia, and Trump Jr., who declined to participate voluntarily, they wrote. (It is unclear whether prosecutors attempted to subpoena the president’s son.)
The picture that was emerging was one of a campaign that was eager for Russia’s help at the same time the Kremlin had been working to elect Trump.
<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">As 2017 stretched</span> on, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with Mifsud and two Russians.

But the special counsel still had not resolved whether Russia coordinated with Trump associates.
In September last year, Mueller’s team got a break. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Manafort, who had been a central figure in the investigation from the start, agreed to plead guilty to financial crimes and failing to register as a foreign lobbyist for work he had conducted in Ukraine before leading the Trump campaign.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">At last, prosecutors had access to a key member of Trump’s inner campaign circle who also had deep connections in Russia, including a business relationship with Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</span>Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, told prosecutors that, as soon as Manafort joined the campaign, he had asked Gates to prepare memos describing his elevated new role for Deripaska and three leading Ukrainian politicians. Emails show Manafort tried to get a message to Deripaska to offer him private briefings about Trump’s effort. Manafort told investigators he never gave Deripaska such briefings.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Manafort’s liaison to the Russian aluminum magnate was his own longtime Russian employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI had assessed had ties to Russian intelligence, according to the special counsel.
</span>The report said Manafort also provided campaign polling data to Kilimnik, described to him a strategy to win the election for Trump by contesting traditionally Democratic-leaning Midwestern states and discussed with him a pro-Russian peace plan for Ukraine, a top foreign policy goal of the Kremlin. Manafort would later say he understood Trump’s sign-off, if elected, would be necessary to advance the plan.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Manafort’s cooperation meant prosecutors finally had a firsthand witness who could explain whether there was ever a suggestion of a trade-off: Russian assistance in the campaign in exchange for a Trump administration that supported pro-Russian policies.

He also appeared twice before the grand jury.
But, prosecutors alleged, he did not tell them everything he knew. A federal judge agreed, ruling in February that Manafort had lied intentionally to prosecutors, particularly about his interactions with Kilimnik.
“It’s part of a pattern of requiring the Office of Special Counsel to pull teeth — withholding facts if he can get away with it,” U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during a February hearing.
In an email to The Washington Post last week, Kilimnik denied he had Russian intelligence ties and said he had not shared the polling information with anyone else. He said he had “absolutely . . . zero” to do with Russian interference.
Meanwhile, several prosecutors on Mueller’s team were pursuing another intriguing subject: Stone, a decades-old friend of Trump who had worked briefly for the celebrity mogul’s campaign <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span> then continued to informally advise him.

During the campaign, Stone egged on WikiLeaks as the London-based group leaked materials prosecutors say were provided by Russian operatives to help elect Trump. Starting in early <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> Stone began bragging publicly that he had a way to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
On Aug.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>— six weeks before WikiLeaks published emails stolen from Podesta — Stone tweeted, “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.”
The seemingly prescient and imperfectly phrased tweet did not mention WikiLeaks. But it led to suspicions by Podesta and others that Stone had been aware of WikiLeaks’ plans in advance.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">For months, Mueller’s team sought to understand whether Stone shared information about WikiLeaks’ activities with the campaign, uncovering numerous examples of Trump’s deep interest in the Clinton emails.
</span>At one point, during a drive to LaGuardia Airport, Trump told senior campaign official Gates that “more releases of damaging information would be coming,” Gates later told prosecutors.
Some in Trump’s orbit appeared to view Stone as having a hand in WikiLeaks’ activities. One person affiliated with a Trump campaign aide sent Stone a text message just after WikiLeaks published Podesta’s emails on Oct.<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.</span> “Well done,” read the message, according to Stone’s eventual indictment, which did not identify the sender.
[Roger Stone was in close contact with Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, indictment shows]
After the election, Stone vociferously and repeatedly denied that he had been in contact with Assange or had any heads-up about WikiLeaks’ plans. He said that he never discussed WikiLeaks with Trump and that his claims during the campaign were just boasts and exaggerations.
Likewise, in written answers prepared by his attorneys, Trump told prosecutors he did “not recall discussing WikiLeaks” with Stone or being aware of Stone discussing the subject with others on his campaign, according to the report.
In <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2017,</span> Stone testified to the House Intelligence Committee that his public hints about WikiLeaks were based on vague tips he’d been given by a New York City radio host and comedian named Randy Credico, whom he described as an “intermediary” and “mutual friend” of Assange.
Credico has denied serving as a back channel for Stone. He said he didn’t become acquainted with Assange until the WikiLeaks founder appeared on his radio show on Aug.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> Stone began talking publicly about having a line to WikiLeaks weeks earlier.
Did Stone have another source? Prosecutors wanted to find out.
They brought Credico — along with his small white therapy dog Bianca — to Washington to testify before the grand jury. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">They interviewed Kristin Davis, a close Stone friend once known as the “Manhattan Madam” because she used to run a prostitution business catering to wealthy New Yorkers.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They issued a subpoena to Stone’s business assistant and held him in contempt of court when he refused to testify.
</span>[How an ex-madam, a political trickster and a toddler got tangled up in the Russia investigation]
They then turned their attention to Corsi, a conservative author who had emailed with Stone about WikiLeaks during the campaign.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Corsi,<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 72,</span> had at one point worked in financial services, but more recently had become a popular writer on the fringe right.</span> He wrote a book <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004 accusing</span> former secretary of state John F. Kerry of lying about his Vietnam service and then became a leading proponent of the false theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, a topic over which he bonded with Trump.
On Aug.<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 28,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> two FBI agents banged on the door of Corsi’s New Jersey home, a grand jury subpoena in hand — kicking off a byzantine turn in the investigation.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">After convening with Gray, a New Jersey attorney who had done legal work for his wife’s cleaning business, Corsi decided he would cooperate with prosecutors.</span> He agreed to turn over his computers and passwords to his social media accounts and to sit for voluntary interviews.
But Corsi’s first meeting in September with prosecutors Zelinksy, Andrew Goldstein and Jeannie Rhee went quickly awry, Gray said in an interview with The Post.
Asked if he’d had anything to do with WikiLeaks during the campaign, Corsi issued a blanket denial. He claimed that he had told Stone during the campaign that trying to contact Assange was a bad idea that could subject them both to investigation, according to a draft court filing.
That wasn’t accurate.
By then, prosecutors had obtained emails showing that Corsi was in constant conversation with his friends and contacts, including Stone, throughout the final months of the campaign, speculating about Assange’s next moves, according to Gray.
On July<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>— a few days after WikiLeaks upset the Democratic National Convention by publishing internal Democratic Party emails — Stone emailed Corsi and asked him to get to Assange and find out what else the WikiLeaks founder held, according to a draft plea agreement Corsi released.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Corsi forwarded Stone’s note to Ted Malloch, an American author living in London who hoped to land a job with Trump and was eager to curry favor with his campaign, according to the draft filing.
</span>According to the report, Malloch told prosecutors he never tried to reach Assange, who was living at the Ecuadoran Embassy. He declined to comment.
Eight days later, Corsi sent Stone an email hinting he had managed to pick up new intelligence on Assange: “Word is friend in embassy <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">plans 2 more</span> dumps.” He predicted one of WikiLeaks’ publications would come in October and referenced Podesta, according to the draft filing: “Time to let more than Podesta to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC.”
[Corsi provided early alert to Stone about WikiLeaks release, according to draft special counsel document]
Corsi has said he was never in direct or indirect contact with Assange. He said he was exaggerating his knowledge to Stone.
“I’m convinced my memory is correct that I didn’t have a source that connected me to Assange,” he told The Post in November. “I really don’t think so.”
But prosecutors used his initial assertion that he declined Stone’s request to seek information from WikiLeaks as a cudgel, saying he could be charged with a crime for lying, Corsi described in a book he wrote about the experience called “Silent No More” that was published in December.
They pressed him to explain: Did he ever reach Assange? Did he tell Stone in advance that WikiLeaks had Podesta’s emails? Did he and Stone help WikiLeaks time the releases for maximum impact?
Gray said that he believed Corsi was trying to be honest, but he acknowledged his client’s answers were not always clear or consistent.
He said he decided to share details from Corsi’s sessions with prosecutors — including reading to The Post from contemporaneous notes — to try to help the public better understand how the clash between the special counsel’s office and witnesses like Corsi frustrated and extended the investigation.
Corsi, he noted, had sold thousands of books and built a fan base by cherry-picking facts to craft a desired narrative. For Corsi, this wasn’t lying, but salesmanship, picking “truthful facts woven in a way that you don’t have to worry about the things that are inconsistent,” Gray said.
The deeply fact-based prosecutors struggled to make sense of the conspiracy theorist and his evolving testimony.
“It’s their biggest nightmare,” Gray said. “The supposed best of the best were just frankly dumbfounded by the whole situation.”
Over sessions in September and October, Corsi offered information that appeared enticing but sketchy.
Corsi claimed he had figured out on his own in early August<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>that WikiLeaks had Podesta’s emails. According to the report, Corsi told Malloch in August or September that WikiLeaks would be releasing Podesta’s emails and then the Trump campaign would be” in the driver’s seat.”
Corsi also told prosecutors he alerted Stone that Podesta’s emails were coming and believed Stone’s “barrel” tweet was based on his information, Corsi has said.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">He claimed he and Stone had then crafted a “cover story” after the tweet to avoid tipping people off to their information — a research memo Corsi submitted to Stone with information about John and his brother Tony Podesta’s business ties to Russia.
</span>Stone told Congress that conversations he’d had with Corsi about the memo were the basis for his tweet, even though the memo was dated Aug.<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 days</span> after he posted his message on Twitter about Podesta.
Gray said prosecutors appeared skeptical of Corsi’s claim that he had merely divined on his own that WikiLeaks would be releasing Podesta’s emails after determining that they were not included in the cache of the Democratic Party emails the group released in July. (Podesta, after all, did not work for the DNC, and his emails were not kept on the party committee’s servers.)
Over and over, they asked Corsi who had told him WikiLeaks held Podesta’s emails and whether he’d communicated with Assange. At one meeting, Gray said Corsi seemed to concede another person might have “planted a seed” in his mind about what WikiLeaks held. Then he said that “maybe he heard it from somewhere,” Gray said.
“His answer had morphed a bit. It was concerning to me, and it was concerning to the prosecutors,” he said.
In his book, Corsi insisted the prosecutors confused and rattled him with their repetitive questioning. At one point, he said he told the trio: “It frustrates me that I can’t remember . . . Sometimes I can’t tell if I remembered or invented.’”
Corsi told The Post in an interview last week: “I did not go in to lie or deceive them.”
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“I told them from the beginning that I couldn’t remember my<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>conversations with the kind of precision they were going to demand,” he said, adding: “I’m not a human tape recorder.”
</span>The group spent long hours in a windowless conference room, with the three prosecutors and half a dozen FBI agents arrayed on one side of the table and Gray and Corsi on the other.
At one point, Gray recalled that his eyes wandered to a whiteboard that covered one wall of the room. It appeared to have been only recently erased from an earlier meeting, and he could just barely make out what had been written there previously:
“Ukraine” it said faintly, underlined three times, an apparent reference to Manafort’s interviews, which were underway during that period. Beneath that were dollar figures tallying into the tens of millions.
Among Corsi’s claims to prosecutors, according to Corsi’s book: that Stone had given him advance notice on Oct.<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span></span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span> that The Post would be publishing a video in which Trump could be heard coarsely bragging about groping women.
Corsi said Stone had urged him to reach Assange and get him to release whatever he’d been holding back to counter the damaging video.
About a half-hour after The Post published a story about the video, WikiLeaks did, in fact, post the first tranche of thousands of Podesta emails.
If there was evidence that Stone played a role in the timing of the Podesta release, it would support the case that there was a conspiracy.
Stone has denied knowing anything about the tape in advance or playing a role in the timing of the Podesta release.
Corsi also told investigators that he believed he had played a role in getting WikiLeaks to release the Podesta emails — though he offered conflicting accounts about how he might have done so, according to the report.
Looking for corroborating evidence, with Corsi’s help, prosecutors constructed a detailed timeline of Corsi’s emails and phone calls in that period. They sought out Corsi’s contacts, looking for anyone who could be a go-between to WikiLeaks.
On Oct.<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> an FBI agent accompanied by a local sheriff’s deputy knocked on the back gate of the home of James and Joanne Moriarty in the Piney Woods, a rural region of eastern Texas.
The couple had lived in Libya before <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 fall</span> of ruler Moammar Gaddafi and had served as sources for Corsi as he worked on articles about what he felt were the failures of the Obama administration in that country.
In the days leading up to the Oct.<span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span></span><span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span> WikiLeaks release, they communicated several times with Corsi about an article he was writing for the right-wing online outlet World Net Daily, James Moriarty told The Post.
Moriarty said he and his wife greeted the FBI agent coldly, first complaining that they did not see the agent as “any kind of good person” because he had come to their home wearing a weapon under his suit jacket.
Moriarty said they then spent three hours telling the agent about their experience in Libya, where he said they were detained by militants, and how they believed they had been relentlessly targeted by the U.S. government since they returned to Texas.
“The invasion of terrorists into the United States is real and present,” Moriarty said. “I told him about this and I told him that, now that he knows, he has to pass it along to other government agencies, including the White House, or he will be guilty of felonious acts.”
Moriarty said he and his wife ultimately consented to be interviewed. The agent spoke to them separately for a total of <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span></span>. They both told the agent they had not connected Corsi to Assange.
The dead end in the Piney Woods was typical.
According to Mueller’s report, investigators could find “little corroboration” for Corsi’s claim that Stone had urged him to help spur the Podesta email release.
In one interview, Corsi suggested he might have publicly tweeted a message that he thought Assange would read.
“Our Office was unable to find evidence of any such tweets,” Mueller wrote.
Gray said the frustration of the prosecution team became obvious. At one meeting, Rhee, a former partner at the prominent law firm WilmerHale, began to raise her voice as Corsi insisted he clearly remembered a conversation he had with Malloch a few months earlier, but not a key conversation he had shortly afterward with Stone.
“That was six months ago,” she said, according to Gray’s notes.
“We find what you’re saying is lacking,” Zelinsky added.
By their final meeting on Nov.<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span></span></span> the prosecutors made their concerns clear. They lectured Corsi for <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span></span> about the need to stick to definite facts.
Then they started in again: Were you a source about WikiLeaks for Roger Stone?
Corsi, who had grown increasingly uncomfortable as the prosecutors spoke, had trouble answering clearly.
After about five minutes, the prosecutors declared they were done, Gray said.
By the end, Mueller’s team had uncovered a wide array of contacts between Trump’s orbit and Russia — contradicting post-election claims from Trump’s representatives that there had been none.
They did not find a crime to charge.
According to the report, prosecutors concluded that Page had formed relationships with Russian intelligence officials before the campaign and that he may have been targeted in<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>by Russian officials because of his Trump campaign tie. They had trouble nailing down everything he did in Moscow during a July<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>visit, they wrote.
But the investigation did not establish he coordinated with the Russian effort in<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016.</span> After the report’s release, Page said he was not surprised, calling his Russia interactions a “big nothingburger.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Mueller’s team also analyzed whether Trump Jr.’s meeting with the Russian lawyer broke campaign finance law prohibiting foreign contributions.</span> They determined they would not be able to prove it did. They also said they could find no connections between the meeting and other Russian efforts to interfere in the election.
Investigators struggled to determine the motive of Manafort’s contacts with Kilimnik, interactions that went “very much to the heart” of the special investigation, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in a court hearing in February.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">[How Manafort’s<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 </span></span></span>meeting with a Russian employee at New York cigar club goes to ‘the heart’ of Mueller’s probe]
They were hampered by not only his lies, according to the report, but his use of encrypted messaging apps.</span> Mueller ultimately did not find sufficient evidence to prove that Manafort or any other Trump associate acted as an agent of the Russian government.
Stone is scheduled to go on trial in November for lying to Congress, obstructing an official proceeding and witness tampering over allegations he attempted to intimidate Credico.
Key details about his case were redacted from the report because of a gag order imposed by the judge, which has also limited what Stone can say in his defense. He is, however, selling T-shirts to fund his legal defense that read, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong!”
It is not clear why Mueller’s team did not file the false-statement charges they threatened against Corsi. Much of the report dealing with their interactions with him has also been redacted by the attorney general, citing possible harm to an ongoing investigation. The report does not specify whether the redactions are related to Stone’s case or other continuing matters.
Corsi said last week that the experience showed the probe was a “fraud from the start.” He said only a “criminal” would urge him to plead guilty to charges that could not be proved in court.
Gray said he believes it would be inappropriate to charge Corsi because he has a faulty memory and noted that prosecutors gave him extensive opportunities to amend their answers.
“They pushed and pushed,” he said. “But at the end of the day, they threw up their hands and said, ‘We can’t use any of this.’ ”

Investors generally assume the U.S. government would bail out the companies in a crisis.

93723,"<h3>Stand With Us!</h3>Owners Challenge Zoning to Make Room for Adult Children, Elderly Parents

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 9</span>:29 pm ET

Junior's living in the basement. Mom and Dad put a tenant in the garage. And now Grandma's moving in. But packing them in like that isn't always legal.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The suburban single-family home is becoming a misnomer as economic reality collides with shifting demographics.

</span>Many suburban communities have long made it difficult, or impossible, for homeowners to convert underused space—barns, garages and basements—into rental apartments. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But across the U.S., homeowners are pressing for changes in zoning laws to allow rentals while home builders report a rise in demand for houses with in-law suites or quarters with separate entry.

</span>""There's a change at both ends,"" said Dean Palos, the director of planning in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City, which is exploring allowing multiple dwellings in one house. ""College graduates are going home to live, parents who are aging want to downsize. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">People see this as an economical way to take advantage of the property they have.</span>""

For decades, many suburban communities have discouraged renting out space in single-family homes, citing concerns including traffic, parking and stress on utilities.

Six years ago, Johnson County considered but ultimately didn't pass a measure to allow so-called accessory units. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But with both the job and housing markets struggling to recover, ""now they are far more sympathetic,"" Mr. Palos said of the county planning commissioners.</span> At least half a dozen recent meetings have been devoted to the issue.

One of five college graduates, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">ages 25 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34,</span> is living with his or her parents, according to the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, the number of shared households—meaning an adult not enrolled in school living with another adult who isn't a spouse—<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 11.4% between</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2007 and</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 19.7 million</span> households <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 22 million</span>, the Census reported last month. Yet the number of households grew <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.3% during</span> the period.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">That number has stagnated as families double up and college graduates accept lower-wage jobs, unable to rent a place of their own.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Economists in part blame the slow recovery of the housing sector on young people who aren't setting up house on their own.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The brunt of America's detached single-family homes—<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 41.9 million</span>, or more than half—are in the suburbs, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies; cities and rural areas comprise the rest.

</span>The rise in shared households challenges the ideals upon which American suburbs were built, including ample space for families, their homes and their cars. But as baby boomers who raised families in the suburbs now age there, many don't want to sell their homes—or can't.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">""People are occupying housing that is three to four times what they need,"" said Patrick Hare, a longtime advocate for and author of books about accessory housing.</span> ""If you take all that surplus space, it can be utilized for accessory apartments.""

That's the calculation that prompted Richard Lacroix, a retired engineer, to ask the town of Arlington, Mass., a Boston suburb, to change local zoning to allow homeowners to create and rent out accessory apartments. He has lived in his four-bedroom home <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1971 and</span> saw an exodus of longtime neighbors because they couldn't afford to stay. He wanted to convert his garage into a studio apartment.

""I <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">am 73 years</span> old,"" he said. ""They should let people age in place. The town is looking to a substantial increase in property taxes."" In May, the proposal was defeated in a town meeting. Mr. Lacroix, who prepared and presented a 17-page report on the merits of accessory units, says he plans to raise the issue again. His annual property taxes <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are $8,000,</span> and he says they are only going up. ""It's just a matter of staying ahead,"" he said.

Zoning definitions and allowances for such rentals vary by locality. Some towns forbid the construction of kitchens or full bathrooms in areas of a home that could be rented out. Others have allowed multiple units for decades as long as one portion is occupied by a homeowner and there is adequate off-street parking and utility capacity.

The real-estate data firm Reis Inc. reported this month that U.S. apartment vacancy rates are at their lowest point in a decade, and that rents were at record levels in more <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 90% of</span> <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 82 markets</span> it tracks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists say the tight rental market is forcing many people to consider alternatives that in better times were largely dismissed—such as a room in a single-family home.

</span>""In some markets, like Washington, New York, San Francisco, [people] can't rent something in the areas they want to rent and they don't want to commute two hours away. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""This may be making some communities more open to rentals and to think about housing more broadly than they have.</span>""

Builders of new homes are responding to the new extended American family—and their homes. Last year, Lennar Corp. rolled out a ""Next Gen"" model, calling it a ""home within a home."" The houses feature a completely separate unit—with own entry, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living area—attached to the main house with a double door similar to adjoining hotel rooms.

""We can't build them fast enough,"" said Jeff Roos, president for Lennar's west region. ""People want to live together but not on top of each other."" He said the houses are attracting primarily families who use the extra unit for their grown children or elderly parents; as a result, the builder hasn't faced much resistance from municipalities worried about rentals, he said.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">In areas where the units are offered, which include Arizona, California and Nevada, the company <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">says 40% of</span> sales are Next Gen homes.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The homes range <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1,800 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,000 square</span> feet, and they are priced from the <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">low $200,000s</span> <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $500,000.</span>

</span>But constructing accessory units in existing homes is drawing ire. The planning board in Montgomery County, Md., has asked the county council to consider a measure to allow conversions without homeowners going through a public hearing. Still, homeowners worry about strained public utilities, schools and even the availability of parking spaces. They say illegal conversions have been a problem for some time now.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">""This is a good way to supplement income on a fixed income like retirees,"" said Valerie Berton, spokeswoman for the planning department.</span> ""People would much prefer to see this than see foreclosures happening.""

""They act as boarding houses without any legal review,"" said Carol Petzold, who lives in Montgomery County and is a board member of the Aspen Hill Civic Association. ""An occasional accessory apartment in a neighborhood is one thing, but when they pile up, there's not enough room on our residential streets for all their vehicles.""

For tenants, such aesthetics likely won't matter. ""At some level, you're looking for additional rental housing anywhere you can find it,"" <span id=""9"" class=""red"">said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council.</span>

46093,"<h3>Analysis | The Daily 202: The political wars over vaccine passports are just getting started</h3>The White House is moving to soothe privacy and equity concerns about the development and deployment of so-called “vaccine passports” that would enable the bearer to prove they’ve been inoculated against the coronavirus.
And the administration is trying to strike a balance about the government’s role by declaring the private sector will lead the effort to design the certificates while also promising federal oversight to ensure citizens are treated fairly.
“We recognize this is a tricky and important subject, but the core here is that Americans, like people around the world, who are vaccinated will want to be able to demonstrate that vaccination in various forms,” said Andy Slavitt, White House senior adviser on the pandemic response.
The debate in the United States over whether and how to develop the “passports” — and to what extent states or businesses could require them — reflects the global disarray on the issue. The European Union is pushing ahead with its version (the “Digital Green Certificate”), Israel is struggling to implement its “Green Passport,” and Japan and China are deploying their own certificates.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">It also follows a year in which advice from experts on testing, mask-wearing, social distancing, economic lockdowns and vaccines turned into tests of partisan loyalties, with Republicans largely echoing Donald Trump’s public doubts about whether such steps were needed.</span> (Resistance to the vaccine today runs high among his supporters, and he only recently disclosed he’d had the shot and encouraged them to follow suit.)
Vaccine passports are the logical next political battleground.
On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a prominent supporter of the former president, decreed the Sunshine State’s borders closed to the idea.
“We are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Proponents say the certificates would provide peace of mind for employees at businesses like restaurants or bars and reassure everyone from air travelers to concert goers.
</span>An administration official, who requested anonymity to detail behind-the-scenes deliberations, said any passport roll-out was “weeks away.”
Concerns about the passports seem to run along two broad paths: Fears government will collect too much data on Americans, use it for purposes other than verifying vaccine status, and fail to safeguard the information — and worries underprivileged Americans who can’t get access to the vaccine will now effectively be punished for it.
Americans who don’t want to get vaccinated at all are obviously unlikely to embrace the certificates, either.
My colleague Paige Winfield Cunningham reports in The Health 202:
“To make passports widely usable, officials would need to create standards for the type of information they must maintain, convince issuers and holders to use the same app or set of apps and figure out how to provide a paper-based system for those who don’t have cellphones. Those are a lot of logistical challenges that would need to be undertaken in a short period of time.”
The Biden administration has moved to address some worries while trying to avoid steps that might inflame vaccine skepticism.
“There will be no centralized, universal federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki promised Monday at her daily briefing.
“Unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens,” Slavitt said. “We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do.”
As for equity, my colleagues Dan Diamond, Lena H. Sun and Isaac Stanley-Becker reported this weekend:
“The passports are expected to be free and available through applications for smartphones, which could display a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass. Americans without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, developers have said.”
As <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 1 in</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5 Americans</span> did not have a smartphone.
“We'll leverage our resources to ensure that all vaccination credential systems meet key standards, whether that's universal accessibility, affordability, availability — both digitally and on paper,” Psaki said.
“It’s also important that we recognize that there are still many, many millions and millions of Americans that have not yet been vaccinated,” said Slavitt. “So that’s a fundamental equity issue.”
Slavitt also acknowledged the possibility that Americans hesitant to get vaccinated might become more so.
“We do know that there is a segment of the population that is concerned that the government will play too heavy-handed of a role in monitoring their vaccinations and that mandates will be coming from the federal government and important — in point of fact, it would discourage people to feel like that was the role we're playing,” he said.
What’s happening now
The murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin continued this morning with recollections from Donald Williams, a key witness. Williams can be heard on video of George Floyd’s death encouraging the officer to get off Floyd, Holly Bailey, Timothy Bella, Kim Bellware and Lateshia Beachum report. Williams testified that he could see Floyd “going through tremendous pain.” Williams said he felt like Floyd’s life was very much in danger before he died and that he was scared for his own safety.
Quote of the day
“The more that his knee was on his neck … the more you see Floyd fade away, slowly fade away,"" said Williams, who is considered a relevant witness because of the vantage point he had standing in proximity to Floyd and Chauvin.

- “A Black Lives Matter activist exposed the role two local police officers played in the Capitol insurrection. Their small town rapidly took sides,” by Kimberly Kindy: “[Bridgette Craighead] understands that her protests and social media posts have pushed to the surface racial and political tensions that have long gripped Rocky Mount — a three-hour drive from Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy. ‘They hate me for it,’ Craighead said. ‘They think I’m stirring things up, that there weren’t any issues until I brought them up. They are there. They don’t want to see them.’”
… and beyond
- “Two weeks after shooting spree, Georgia Senate backs bill to loosen gun restrictions,” by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Maya Prabhu: “House <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Bill 218 passed</span> 34-18 on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support of the measure. The fact that the vote came shortly after the spa shootings was something Democrats highlighted in opposing the bill. ‘We don’t have to live like this,’ said Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat.”
- “Group backed by Murdoch daughter-in-law targets primary elections as a 'threat to democracy,’ ” by Yahoo News’s Jon Ward: “Only <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span> of American voters choose about eight out <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10 members</span> of Congress, says a new report out Tuesday from Unite America, a group that is pushing states to adopt nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. This small group — <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">this 10 percent</span> who make up primary voters in both parties — encourages extremism and gridlock rather than bipartisan cooperation, the report argues. … Unite America is more than an organization that puts out reports, however. … <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Kathryn Murdoch, a philanthropist with deep financial resources as the daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, donated <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $6 million</span> to the group <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020 alone</span>.”
</span>- “The antiscience movement is escalating, going global and killing thousands,” by Scientific American’s Peter Hotez: “Facilitating the spread of COVID-19 is an expanded and globalizing antiscience movement that began modestly under a health freedom banner adopted by the Republican Tea Party in Texas. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Thousands of deaths have so far resulted from antiscience, and this may only be the beginning as we are now seeing the impact on vaccine refusal across the U.S., Europe and the low- and middle-income countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.”
</span>The <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">first 100 days</span>
Biden will today sign bipartisan legislation extending the Paycheck Protection Program.
- “The bill that Biden plans to sign in the Oval Office will extend the program through <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30.</span> It is currently set to expire on <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 31,</span>” John Wagner reports.
- An NPR-Marist poll found that Americans have given Biden better marks on his handling of the coronavirus than his handling of immigration. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Sixty percent approve of his job on the coronavirus, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 34 percent</span> approve of his job on immigration.</span> The poll comes as a growing number of Americans are getting vaccinated and thousands of migrants are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, Wagner notes.
- Satisfaction with the U.S. vaccine rollout surged <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 68 percent</span>, according to a new Gallup poll, doubling since January. “With more than a million Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines every day, the public's overall willingness to be inoculated against the disease has edged up three points. This continues the upward trajectory to a new high <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 74% since</span> hitting a low <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 50% in</span> September.”
Congressional Democrats and the administration are considering lowering the Medicare eligibility age.
- “Democrats are still negotiating over which healthcare policy elements could be in the second of two spending programs the administration plans to unveil soon, according to congressional aides and industry groups,” the WSJ’s Stephanie Armour and Kristina Peterson report. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The package is likely to contain measures to reduce drug prices and expand health coverage, lawmakers said.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Proposals to expand Medicare eligibility from <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 65 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60 and</span> to enable the federal government to negotiate drug prices in the health program for seniors… are also likely to be included.”
- “The healthcare proposals would face opposition from many Republicans and hospital groups, who say they could reduce the labor force because more people may retire early.”
</span>Biden released his first slate of judicial nominees.
- With the batch <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 11 nominees</span>, the administration aims to boost diversity in federal courts nationwide, Ann Marimow and Matt Viser report.
- The list includes three Black women for appeals court vacancies: U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, often mentioned as someone who could become the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, was nominated to replace Attorney General Merrick Garland in the influential D.C. Appeals Court. Meanwhile, Tiffany P. Cunningham, a patent attorney in Chicago, was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a D.C.-based lawyer, was named to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
- The list also includes candidates that, if confirmed, would become the first Muslim American to serve on a District Court, the first Asian American woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit, and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge in Maryland.
- While Republicans will likely oppose some of the nominees, they all face easy confirmations if the Democratic caucus stays united. Our colleagues reported last month that the administration is following Trump’s practice to speed up the process by forgoing the American Bar Association review of candidates in advance of formal nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee could hold hearings on the nominations by late April.
Biden won’t throw the first pitch at the Nationals stadium this Opening Day.
- The D.C. baseball team invited Biden to Opening Day moments after the presidential race was called <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020.</span></span> Today, the team said that Biden would not be coming to the stadium on Thursday but that he was welcome to throw out a first pitch sometime in the future, John Wagner and Chelsea Janes report.
- “Dating back to President William Howard Taft <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1910,</span> every U.S. president had thrown out a first pitch at some point in their presidency during years that Washington had a professional baseball team. That tradition ended with Trump,” our colleagues note.
The future of the GOP
Republicans, in a private call, acknowledged that Democrats’ expansive electoral reform bill is popular across the political spectrum.
- “In private, they concede their own polling shows that no message they can devise effectively counters the argument that billionaires should be prevented from buying elections,” writes the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer. “A recording obtained by The New Yorker of a private conference call on January 8th, between a policy adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell and the leaders of several prominent conservative groups — including one run by the Koch brothers’ network — reveals the participants’ worry that the proposed election reforms garner wide support not just from liberals but from conservative voters, too.”
- “The participants conceded that the bill, which would stem the flow of dark money from such political donors as the billionaire oil magnate Charles Koch, was so popular that it wasn’t worth trying to mount a public-advocacy campaign to shift opinion. Instead, a senior Koch operative said that opponents would be better off ignoring the will of American voters and trying to kill the bill in Congress.”
Florida Republicans are considering a new election bill that would ban giving voters water <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 150 feet</span> of polling places.
- “State law currently prohibits offering voters assistance <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 100 feet</span> of polling locations,” NBC News reports. The new bill “proposes expanding that zone <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 150 feet</span> and includes a prohibition on giving ‘any item’ to voters or ‘interacting or attempting to interact’ with voters within that zone.”
- The Florida bill would also “require voters to request mail ballots more frequently, add more identification requirements for mail voting, and limit how drop boxes are used.”
- “The [Florida] proposal is similar to a measure in Georgia’s sweeping new election law that bans giving water, food or gifts to voters waiting in line, among many other restrictions."" The Georgia measure mainly targets third-party activities, since poll workers can still set up self-serve coolers for voters.
Corporations are very vocal about racial justice. Voting rights, not so much.
- “Last week, as Georgia Republicans rushed to pass a sweeping law restricting voter access, Atlanta’s biggest corporations, including Delta, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, declined to weigh in, offering only broad support for voting rights. The muted response — coming from companies that last year promised to support social justice — infuriated activists, who are now calling for boycotts,” the New York Times’s David Gelles reports.
- “Companies have effectively squashed bills at the state level before. <span id=""7"" class=""red""><span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> when lawmakers were advancing the bathroom bills, major corporations said they would move jobs out of states that adopted such measures,” Gelles notes.</span> “This time around, however, the entertainment industry has taken a more guarded approach. … The fight in Georgia is likely a preview of things to come. Lawmakers in dozens of states have proposed similar voting bills, and activists are planning to ramp up the pressure on corporate America as the battle over voting rights goes national.”
The Freedom Caucus is fretting over how far to push its rebellion.
- “A notable split has emerged inside the House Freedom Caucus in recent weeks over its members' use of delaying tactics on the floor to protest Democratic policies. That effort has grabbed attention and ruffled leadership, two hallmarks of the Freedom Caucus, but it's also snarled legislative proceedings enough to breed frustration among some members of the far-right crew,” Politico’s Olivia Beavers and Melanie Zanona report.
- “Some in the caucus criticize the legislative slowdown, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and several others, as a failure to act strategically. Conservatives should challenge a select few bills rather than a wide swath, these Republicans argue, to avoid diluting the potency of moments when they choose to tie the House in procedural knots … But other Freedom Caucus members feel strongly that wreaking havoc on the floor is part of their brand and they need to deploy every procedural weapon at their disposal.”
Today in history
President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt on this day <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span> “In the 70th day of his presidency, Reagan underwent three hours of surgery at George Washington University Hospital to remove the bullet that entered under his left armpit, struck his seventh rib and burrowed three iches into his left lung,"" reported The Post's David S. Broder. ""On his way into surgery, the president gamely reassured friends: 'Don't worry about me. I'll make it.'”
Hot on the left
An accused Capitol rioter was arrested in a T-shirt reading “I was there” with Trump’s photo and the date of the insurrection. “When police showed up at Garret Miller’s Dallas home earlier this year to arrest him on charges that he had participated in the Capitol riot, his wardrobe spoke for itself,” Katie Shepherd reports. “New details of his Jan.<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20 arrest</span> were revealed this week in court documents as prosecutors urged a judge not to release him before his trial, noting that he allegedly admitted to bringing a gun into the Capitol during the deadly insurrection. Police also found an array of weapons and gear in Miller’s house, prosecutors said, including a grappling hook, ropes, body armor, night vision goggles, a crossbow and arrows, and multiple firearms with ammunition. … He also sent a selfie [during the attack] that showed him standing inside the Capitol Rotunda, according to court records, with the caption: ‘Just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol.’”
Hot on the right
Trump came after Tony Fauci and Deborah Birx after they both criticized his management of the pandemic response. Birx, who ran Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, told CNN a few days ago that she was “marginalized every day,” Diamond reports. “The majority of the people in the White House did not take this seriously,” she said. Fauci, meanwhile, lamented the “lost opportunity” when Trump chose to get vaccinated in private.

It is a similar story for oil prices, which many investors believe should rise if economic prospects are improving.</span> Instead, crude has swung in both directions following past rate cuts.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">As markets enter the second half <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of<span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019,</span></span> analysts and investors are closely watching the Fed, putting new emphasis on the central bank’s meeting at the end of the month.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">If the Fed lowers rates, it would mark its first rate cut <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008,</span> when it began embracing easy money after the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015,</span> but they still remain well below precrisis levels.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The possible change of course comes at a time when other global central banks are shifting toward easing monetary policy, just after they had begun tentatively stepping away from postcrisis policies.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Bets on lower rates helped push the S&<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 and</span> Dow industrials to fresh records last week, with indexes from the U.S. to Europe <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 15% or</span> more for the year.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Some analysts warn lower rates won’t support stocks and other risky investments if the economy slows markedly, as many investors expect, or morphs into a recession.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">“There’s a lot of unfounded optimism that this recovery could be perpetually supported by fiscal and monetary policy,” says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus.</span> “That’s not indefinitely positive.”

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">So do economic conditions today look more like they did in the market-fueled downturns of the ’90s, or in the buildup to the housing crisis of 2007?

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some investors say current conditions are comparable to those surrounding Fed rate cuts <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995 and</span></span></span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1998,</span></span> when the central bank eased policy and a recession didn’t follow.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">The unemployment rate is currently near its lowest level in almost five decades, and some analysts expect economic growth to slow from its first-quarter annual rate <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.1% but</span> remain stable.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report Friday, investors this week will parse minutes from the Fed’s last meeting and figures on consumer prices to gauge the trajectory of U.S. growth.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Stubbornly soft inflation has also given some analysts confidence that the Fed will lower rates later this month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual testimony to Congress will also be in focus this week.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Another factor keeping investors optimistic: Interest rates still remain relatively low compared with historical levels.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Following the best first half of the year for the S&<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 since</span><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1997,</span> analysts are also weighing whether investors are too optimistic about the effects of rate cuts.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Stocks have risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of a Fed rate cut later this month.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red""><span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1995,</span> they also rallied before the Fed lowered rates, only to continue their run.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red""><span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1998 rate</span> cut was preceded by sharp stock-market declines as the meltdown of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management nearly brought down the financial system.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Markets stabilized after the Fed cut rates.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red""><span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2001,</span> stocks also slid before the central bank cut rates as the tech-stock bubble burst.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Some analysts say protectionist trade policies are muddying the economic outlook to such an extent that past interest-rate cycles aren’t comparable to the current period.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">An index measuring economic-policy uncertainty around the world created by professors at Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago climbed near its highest level ever last month.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">Even if the Fed lowers rates, some analysts are skeptical business and consumer spending will pick up if the U.S.-China trade fight remains unresolved.</span> That could mean recent optimism driving stocks higher is misplaced, these analysts say.

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“It’s gone way too far,” says Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“If the Fed cuts and people don’t want to borrow because capital spending is frozen basically, what you end up with is a lot of money just sitting in the banks.”

</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">In one warning sign that the 10-year-old economic expansion could come to an end relatively soon, the gap between long- and short-term bond yields, known as the yield curve, turned negative earlier this year.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">A yield curve inversion has preceded the last several recessions, though they have often occurred well after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has dropped below the three-month yield in the past.

</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">There is also the issue of timing investments around Fed rate cuts.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">An analysis of similar periods during which the Fed cut rates after previously raising them by Toronto money manager Gluskin Sheff & Associates showed the S&<span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 returned</span><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22% on</span> average in the year following the last interest-rate cut of each cycle.

</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">The gap between the performance of stocks and the 10-year Treasury note was also much bigger following the final rate cut of each cycle than after the first time rates dropped, the analysis found.</span> Gluskin Sheff also included rate-cut periods starting <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span><span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1987 and</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989.</span>

<span id=""39"" class=""red"">“You want to resist the temptation at all costs to jump in after the first rate cut,” says David Rosenberg, the firm’s chief economist.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">“The stock market really differentiates itself the year after the last rate cut.”

37368,"<h3>Oil Prices Spike After Attack on Saudi Facilities but Lasting Disruption Seen Unlikely</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">HOUSTON — Oil prices rose <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span> on Monday as investors reacted to a weekend attack on one of Saudi Arabia’s most important oil facilities that could cripple petroleum exports for days or even weeks.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But experts say that a severe shock to energy markets and the world economy would be unlikely.
</span>The attack on the Abqaiq processing facility and another plant, deep in Saudi territory, displayed the vulnerability of the kingdom to tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The country produces <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span> of the world’s oil supplies. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia’s daily oil exports <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7.4 million</span> barrels by as much as three-quarters, taking <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 5 percent</span> of global supplies off the market, unless the facility is quickly repaired.
</span>President Trump suggested on Sunday that he could release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an attempt to calm oil markets. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Brent crude oil futures briefly spiked <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span>, or more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $11 a</span> barrel, when trading started on Monday and then eased to an increase of <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 percent</span></span></span>, or just <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $6 a</span> barrel.
</span>The attack raised the possibility of further disruptions in Saudi Arabia’s oil production if there were additional attacks on its fields and pipelines.
The planned initial public offering of the kingdom’s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, could also be hurt if international investors doubt Saudi Arabia’s ability to defend its vital energy infrastructure.
But as luck would have it, the attack came as global oil stockpiles were higher than usual, several producing countries have ample spare capacity and American oil facilities have so far been spared from a damaging hurricane season. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, a slowing global economy has moderated energy demand.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“We do not expect an immediate disruption on global oil trade, since many nations, including the U.S., have ample crude oil in storage,” said Manish Raj, chief financial officer of Velandera Energy Partners, a Louisiana oil exploration and production company.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The Saudis themselves have enough storage to meet their export obligation for the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 60 days</span>.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Therefore, we expect no supply-demand imbalance in the near term.”
</span>The main uncertainty is how long will it take for the Saudis to repair the Abqaiq facility, which separates gas from oil from several important oil fields. While the fire was put out quickly, the Saudis may not know the answer for days since the facility is large and has complex equipment that still needs to be tested.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Should the damage be fixed quickly, Eurasia Group, a risk consulting firm, estimates that oil prices could rise a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">modest $2 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $3 a</span> barrel, which would still leave the global benchmark Brent crude <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $65 a</span> barrel, relatively low by recent historical standards.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The firm estimated that a more long-lasting disruption could mean an increase <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $10 a</span> barrel, though that would still leave prices several dollars below where they were a year ago.
</span>Other analysts took a dimmer view, even as Saudi Aramco said on Sunday that repairs were already underway. The initial reaction of oil traders was panicky.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“The problem is that the attack is so significant, “ said Bill Farren-Price a director at RS Energy Group, a market research firm.</span> “It demonstrates that one of the best regional oil companies has difficulties defending itself from this new style of threat. That theme is going to endure. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">“

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">The United States and other developed countries have <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3 billion</span> barrels in stockpiles, according to the International Energy Agency, enough to take care of about two months of demand.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">That is <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 million</span> barrels above a year ago, despite American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that have constricted their exports.

The developed countries and China have sizable strategic reserves as well in cases of emergency, although stockpiles have been declining in the United States and Europe in recent weeks.
Until this weekend, OPEC has been more concerned about oversupply than shortages.

55683,"<h3>A Movie Summer of Few Sure Things</h3>When it comes to box-office blockbusters, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 is</span> looking slim, raising questions for the next wave of would-be mega-franchises and hopes for the indies going up against them.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The movie business today is driven largely by a small number of pictures that achieve megahit status, often sucking all the oxygen out of the marketplace.
</span>Last year, four movies released during Hollywood’s summer season, which runs from May through August, grossed more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $850 million</span> world-wide: “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” Jurassic World,” “Inside Out” and “Minions.”
This summer, many in the movie industry believe, only two releases seem poised to reach those heights: May’s “Captain America: Civil War,” which despite its title is essentially a third “Avengers,” stuffed with nearly every superhero from the Marvel Studios pantheon; and June’s “Finding Dory,” a long-awaited follow-up to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2003 Pixar</span> hit “Finding Nemo.”
Memorial Day weekend’s “X-Men: Apocalypse” should also do very well, but no movie in that series has grossed more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $760 million</span>.
“It looks like this summer will not be nearly as strong as last summer,” said Josh Lynn, head of Piedmont Media Research. “Few, if any, films appear to have the potential to break out as hugely as ‘Jurassic’ or ‘Ultron” and most are in the expected middle range.”
A paucity of billion-dollar movies in the summer <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016 could</span> be good news for competitors that aren’t sequels or videogame adaptations. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When one movie does phenomenal business at the box office, it tends to take up every ounce of audience attention and cultural buzz, making it impossible for quirky, original films to find room to breathe.</span> “Jurassic World,” for instance, was widely blamed for the failure last June of two Sundance Film Festival award -winners, “Dope” and “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” that opened within a week of the mega-dino-hit.
If “Independence Day: Resurgence” doesn’t completely dominate the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 4 time</span> frame, for example, there might be a shot for “Free State of Jones,” a Civil War drama starring Matthew McConaughey that is bravely opening against the alien-invasion sequel.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Other dramas and offbeat comedies aimed at adults that are opening against bigger-budget competition and include the Russell Crowe- Ryan Gosling 1970s spy comedy “The Nice Guys,” opening against “Angry Birds” and “Neighbors 2”; Woody Allen’s “Cafe Society,” which debuts against “Ghostbusters”; “Florence Foster Jenkins” with Meryl Streep vying with a “Pete’s Dragon” remake; and “The Founder,” starring Michael Keaton as the man who built McDonalds into an empire.</span> It will face off with “Suicide Squad.”-
Hollywood’s major studios, meanwhile, are hoping sequels to moderately successful movies or adaptations of long-in-the-tooth brands could morph into their next major franchises.
But is the world eager for a follow-up to Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland?” Or “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?” How about movies based on the videogames “World of Warcraft” and “Angry Birds,” that peaked in popularity a few years ago? Are “Independence Day” and “Ghostbusters,” last seen on the big screen <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1996 and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> respectively, ready for a comeback similar to what “Jurassic World” pulled off last summer? Can “The Legend of Tarzan” reignite a franchise whose glory days were in the ‘30s?
If recent box-office returns are any indication, in most cases the answer will be no. Plenty of sequels have fizzled in recent months, such as “Snow White” follow-up “The Huntsman: Winter’s War,” the third “Divergent” and “<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Zoolander<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.</span></span>” <span id=""3"" class=""red"">While audiences love well-known titles—witness “The Jungle Book” —the market is so saturated with them that they are more a necessary condition for success than a guarantee.</span> (Animation remains the one genre in which originality regularly shines, as most recently evidenced by “Zootopia.”).
Even franchises that have long been solid have lost their footing. In the past, there was no question that the same people would turn out for each installment of “Harry Potter” or “Twilight,” which is why so many were shocked to see November’s fourth and final “Hunger Games” <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gross $55 million</span> less than No.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $144 million</span> less than No.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.</span> That makes <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 movies</span> that previously would have been sure things, like the fifth “Ice Age” or the 13th “Star Trek,” all of a sudden anything but.
Managing director Eric Handler of research firm MKM Partners is forecasting that box office returns will be down a <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hefty 7% between</span> April and June compared with the same period a year ago, though he believes the back half of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">summer 2016 will</span> fare somewhat better in comparison to last year. Buzz on the August DC Comics supervillain ensemble film “Suicide Squad,” for example, is better than that of last August’s superhero bomb “Fantastic Four.”
If the summer isn’t dominated by a handful of blockbusters, it’s not only upscale audiences who may find more to see at the multiplex. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There are also R-rated comedies looking to be the next “Trainwreck,” such as “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” and “Bad Moms”; low-budget horror flicks “The Shallows” and “Lights Out”; and the teen-girl tear-jerker “Me Before You,” which is, not coincidentally, opening on the same weekend where “The Fault In Our Stars” succeeded two years ago.

In a high-stakes video call, President Biden warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of “strong economic and other measures” from the U.S. and European allies if military tensions with Ukraine escalated.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">President Biden, in a high-stakes virtual meeting on Tuesday morning, warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of economic consequences if he continued to escalate a military presence around Ukraine, according to a White House statement.
</span>The diplomatic effort came as tens of thousands of Russian troops mass along the Ukrainian border, raising fears of an invasion.
Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, described the president’s comments to reporters.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“He told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,” Mr. Sullivan said.
</span>He later added, “There was a lot of give and take, there was no finger wagging, but the president was crystal clear about where the United States stands.”
Mr. Sullivan said the administration was also prepared to send supplies and additional resources to Ukraine if Russia escalated its military presence.
Asked for specifics for the consequences facing Russia, Mr. Sullivan declined to go into detail. “I will look you in the eye and tell you as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today that things we did not do <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> we are prepared to do now,” Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the year Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Virtually no country has recognized the action, and Western powers continue to condemn Russia for it.
The U.S. and Russian leaders began their conversation via video-link at 10:07 a.m., according to the White House, and it ended at 12:08 p.m. According to the White House, they also discussed ransomware and issues related to Iran. Before the call, Biden officials said the discussion would cover nuclear arms control, cybersecurity and Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed to continue the dialogue on the issues discussed on Tuesday.
Mr. Biden would be speaking to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, on Thursday, Mr. Sullivan said.
In a brief video of the opening moments of the call released by Russian state television, Mr. Putin said, “Greetings, Mr. President!”
“Good to see you again,” Mr. Biden responded warmly, after what appeared to be a brief connection glitch. “Unfortunately, last time we didn’t get to see one another at the G20. I am hoping next time we meet we do it in person.”
The video showed Mr. Putin seated at a long wooden desk, with Mr. Biden on a large video screen in front of him, and he waved to Mr. Biden as the call began. Mr. Putin took the call from his residence in Sochi, the Russian resort city on the Black Sea.
After the call ended, Mr. Biden was expected to hold a separate call with multiple U.S. allies, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. The leaders had previously agreed to stay in contact on Russia’s deployment to Ukraine, according to the White House.
The virtual meeting with Mr. Putin was a crucial test for Mr. Biden, as he tried to protect Ukraine, a democratic ally whose security U.S. officials have promised to defend, and head off a major European security crisis.
Mr. Putin has complained that Ukraine poses a threat to Russia through its close military and political ties to the United States and European powers.
U.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin has not decided whether to invade Ukraine. But the United States has disclosed intelligence showing that Russia’s military has developed a war plan that envisions as many <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 175,000 troops</span> pouring across Ukraine’s border — an invasion force that Ukraine’s military, despite U.S.-provided equipment and training, would have little ability to stop.
Don’t call it a Zoom.
President Biden’s talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday relied on a secure communications process about which the Biden administration has very little to say: not about conducting the call, or the full list of participants, or how the contents of the call will be memorialized.
“As a general rule we would not talk about security measures or the logistics of the president’s calls with world leaders,” Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said.
But based on recent history — including details that emerged after a whistle-blower’s revelations about former President Donald J. Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019 </span>— there are more than a few clues to piece together about the mechanics of the call.
Each White House organizes its calls differently, according to Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a former cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, and sometimes the protocol can vary from leader to leader. But a secure call essentially means the communication between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin would be encrypted.
“A lot of other intelligence services out there would love to know what conversation actually took place between the president of the U.S. and the president of Russia,” Mr. Daniel said in an interview. “You want to encrypt the bits as they’re flowing” from leader to leader.
To memorialize calls with foreign leaders, presidential administrations have relied on the so-called TNet system, a highly secure network that connects to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, a secure intranet system operated by the Defense Department. More sensitive files can be stored in an even more tightly controlled program, called NICE, for N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment: “You have a lot of control over what pieces of data that people can get to depending on their access,” Mr. Daniel added.
The calls are organized through the National Security Council, with the council’s executive secretary overseeing the logistics. Often, the president, working with the national security adviser, decides who will be present or able to listen in for the calls.
Mr. Biden’s side of the call was in the Situation Room, which is historically where presidents have hosted secure calls with other world leaders. Mr. Putin’s side was from his residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Tass, the state news agency.
The longstanding White House policy is to not record calls held in the Situation Room, according to Larry Pfeiffer, who served as a director of the Situation Room during the Obama administration. Instead, there is a transcription, which, he said, allows the White House “both a historical record that can be relied upon but allows for plausible deniability” if something unflattering were to leak. (The limits of transcription were exposed in some detail two years ago, in the aftermath of accusations that aides to then President Donald J. Trump mishandled the system to store a call with the Ukrainian president.)
Mr. Biden was solo onscreen when the call started, but it is common practice to have aides on hand listening to the call. Each would have a designated role. The Situation Room is equipped with voice-to-text translation software, and a note taker relies on that software to assemble an account of what the two leaders say. In this case, several experts said, a translator would also likely be present.
A subject-matter expert on the National Security Council is also generally present. That person looks over the material from the call, reviews and edits it based on their understanding of the foreign leader and current events, and then passes it along to the national security adviser.
Mr. Biden’s advisers say that the president believes that there are benefits to meeting face-to-face and in-person with a leader like Mr. Putin. But with mounting Russian aggression toward Ukraine and the threat of an invasion hanging in the balance, Mr. Biden did not have the luxury of travel time to practice his preferred in-person approach to diplomacy. On Tuesday, the day of their call, machine-gun fire and the flash of rocket-propelled grenades were reported along Ukraine’s border.
With Putin-Biden meeting, skirmishes break out between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military exchanged fire with Russian-backed separatists using machine guns and grenade launchers on Tuesday, the day on which President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia discussed ways to ease mounting tensions in the region.
While the skirmish was not unusual, it was a reminder that even as leaders in Moscow and Washington were engaging in high-stakes diplomatic negotiations, a war that has claimed thousands of lives over the past seven years showed no signs of abating.
A recent influx of Russian soldiers along the border with Ukraine has led to fears of a wider conflagration and the prospect that Russia might be planning an invasion of the eastern European nation.
The exchange of fire on Tuesday broke out at three locations along the so-called line of contact, a roughly 250-mile-long barricade of trenches and fortifications between Ukrainian soldiers and their opponents in a protracted war of attrition.
The Ukrainian side suffered no casualties, according to the press office of the Ukrainian armed services. It was unclear if the separatists had any losses. According to the Ukrainians, it was the separatists who fired first.
“Ukrainian defenders opened fire in response,” the press service said in a statement, “and forced the enemy to cease fire.”
Though such violence occurs almost daily in the region, in this period of explosive tension there are fears that an errant bullet or mortar shell could be all that is needed to touch off a serious escalation. Even when fired upon, Ukrainian soldiers are under strict orders not to respond unless absolutely necessary.
“This really annoys the soldiers, that we’re not allowed to respond,” said First Lt. Ivan Skuratovsky, of Ukraine’s 25th Airborne Brigade, which is deployed at the front in the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka.
Serious casualties on the front lines are uncommon these days, though a handful of Ukrainian soldiers are killed each month, usually by sniper fire. There were seven soldiers killed in September, two in October and six in November. Last week, a 22-year-old soldier named Valeriy Herovkin became the first killed in December.
As concern mounts over Russia’s menacing massing of troops on the Ukrainian border, many analysts say that the fate of the eastern European nation matters far more to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than to the Biden administration.
Mr. Putin speaks often about the former Soviet republic’s historical and ethnic ties to Russia, while President Biden has said his goal is to establish a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia.
But Mr. Putin, who raised similar alarms with a deployment near Ukraine this spring, has once again seized the attention of Washington. And he came to Tuesday’s meeting with demands of his own, including his insistence that NATO forswear the possibility of making Ukraine a member of the alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have countered that Moscow cannot dictate the foreign policy choices of other nations.
Even if he does not plan to invade Ukraine, Mr. Putin may be wagering that Mr. Biden’s preoccupation with matters like the coronavirus pandemic and competition with China will make him inclined to strike a deal.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Seen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin’s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kyiv or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine,” Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in an analysis published on Monday.
</span>“Rather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin’s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs,” Mr. Samorukov added. For Mr. Putin, any moves by Ukrainian leaders to draw closer to the West are an affront.
Complicating matters for Mr. Biden is European uncertainty about how to handle Mr. Putin’s newest threats. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">European nations are dependent on Russia for much of their energy supplies, and their economies stand to suffer if relations with Russia deteriorate further.
</span>The Biden administration has been negotiating with European leaders in an effort to unify around which punishments could be inflicted on Russia for any new aggression.
The first time that President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia encountered each other in a leader-to-leader summit, it was on a sunny day last June at an estate on Lake Geneva — and the meeting was dominated by ransomware attacks on the United States, rather than the specter of an invasion of Ukraine.
Mr. Biden had, weeks before, agreed with the characterization of Mr. Putin as a “killer.” Mr. Putin denied that Russia was behind a remarkably broad breach of American corporate and government computer networks — the “Solar Winds” attack which was discovered a year ago, just as Mr. Biden was preparing to take office — traced to one of Russia’s premier intelligence agencies.
“We want a stable, predictable relationship,” Mr. Biden said going into the summit, an acknowledgment that the heady days of the 1990s, when there was talk of Russia joining Europe (and maybe, eventually, even NATO) were gone forever, and that the best that could be hoped for was good communications.
The Geneva meeting was tense. “I did what I came to do,’’ Mr. Biden said after the meeting, including laying out a series of warnings and red lines for the Russian leader, which he insisted were not “threats.” “I think the last thing he wants now is a Cold War.”
Mr. Putin called Mr. Biden “constructive, well-balanced and experienced,” and said he wanted agreements on “rules of behavior” on sensitive subjects like nuclear weapons and cybersecurity — an echo of American officials’ hopes of finding “guardrails” for the U.S.-Russian relationship.
Mr. Biden emerged offering some modest optimism that the United States, by restoring its alliances in Europe, had made Mr. Putin more cautious about any actions regarded as being against Western interests.
For a few months it looked like something was getting done. Led by Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, talks began on “strategic stability,” the diplomatic code words for managing the nuclear arsenal — and, increasingly, space and cyberweapons — in ways that do not lead to accidental war or unnecessary military escalation. Another set of conversations, quiet and private, took place between Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and her Russian counterpart. Ransomware attacks continued, the F.B.I. reported, but nothing that seemed threatening to critical infrastructure.
But in October and November, just as the administration was promoting modest progress, satellite photographs began to appear on desks around Washington showing a major buildup of forces around Ukraine. The administration sent William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former American ambassador to Russia, to send a warning.
Apparently, the message didn’t get through.
AVDIIVKA, Ukraine — Machine-gun fire broke the stillness just <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 8 p</span>.m. when Capt. Denis Branitskii was midway through the evening patrol. The shots came in sporadic bursts and were close by, fired by Russian-backed separatists whose positions were obscured in the darkness. Only when the flash of a rocket-propelled grenade illuminated the newly fallen snow did Captain Branitskii break his stride, briefly pausing to take cover before moving on.
“This happens every night,” said Captain Branitskii, a cleft-chinned company commander with the Ukrainian military’s 25th Airborne Brigade, positioned along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. “Sometimes it’s much heavier, sometimes it’s like tonight. Tonight, this is fine.”
This is the scene on the front lines right now, ahead of a phone call on Tuesday between President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at staving off a far more serious military escalation. After eight years of war, few in Ukraine believe the call will lead to an immediate breakthrough that might spare their country further violence.
“I wouldn’t expect a breakthrough,” said Dmitry Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, according to the Interfax news agency. “Putin will hear very clear signals from President Biden about what Ukraine’s partners will do if Putin comes head with a military operation against our country.”
Mr. Kuleba said that following the call, Mr. Biden would speak with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
So far, soldiers on the front lines said they had seen little evidence of escalation beyond a largely slow-moving war of attrition that set in after both sides fought to a stalemate over territory seized by Russian-backed forces <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Compared with the vicious fighting that preceded it, this is a holiday, several soldiers said.
On Monday, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Ukrainian armed forces, Mr. Zelensky donned a helmet and flak jacket and visited the troops on the front lines. He later announced that Ukraine’s frontline brigades would soon be getting new weapons systems including modernized tanks and armored personnel carriers. He also announced that Ukraine had signed a deal with Britain to build a new fleet of gunboats and purchase new anti-mine ships.
The Ukrainian military has made significant progress <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2014,</span> when it nearly disintegrated in the face of a lightning operation by Russian forces to seize territory, first by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then by fomenting a separatist takeover in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Ukrainian troops have since fought alongside NATO forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and trained with American military advisors.
But few believe that Ukraine’s military could hold out for long against a full-on Russian invasion. Some military analysts have said that, at most, Ukraine would at best manage an organized retreat.
If a full-on attack comes, Ukrainian forces are as ready to face it as they’ve ever been, said Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, commander of the Joint Forces Operation battling the separatists. But even this, he acknowledged, would not be enough to hold off the Russian military without significant assistance from Western countries, specifically the United States.
“This is a beast who has tasted blood,” General Pavlyuk said. “Believe me, the losses are going to be horrible on both sides — thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. On their side and ours.”
As vice president during the Obama administration, Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the lead role in managing America’s relationship with Ukraine as it fended off Russian aggression.
Now, as president, Mr. Biden is making a dramatic effort to rescue the country from the gravest threat it has faced in decades, by trying to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia not to mount the invasion that U.S. officials say he is planning.
President Barack Obama gave Mr. Biden the Ukraine portfolio in his second term, after Ukraine’s Russia-backed president was ousted in a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014 popular</span> revolution. Mr. Putin considers the pro-Western leadership that came in at that time both an affront and a security threat.
In the following years, Mr. Biden visited Ukraine a half-dozen times, forging relationships with politicians and activists. After Mr. Putin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and fomented rebellion in the country’s east, Mr. Biden declared “the unwavering support of the United States of America and the American people” for Ukraine.
“It is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of freedom-loving people the world over are with you because so much rides on your fragile experiment with democracy succeeding,” Mr. Biden said in a <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2015 speech</span> to Ukraine’s Parliament.
“I was the point man for our administration on the crisis, which was exactly where I wanted to be,” Mr. Biden later wrote in a memoir. He scoffed at critics who predicted that Ukraine would amount to a defeat for the West at Mr. Putin’s hands, one that would haunt him politically. “I didn’t much care. There was an important principle at stake: Big countries ought not to beat up smaller ones,” he wrote.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Biden’s engagement did bring a political cost: It would expose him to political attacks — frequently in exaggerated and distorted terms — by Donald J. Trump and his allies over his son Hunter’s lucrative work for a Ukrainian energy company.
</span>At times as vice president, Mr. Biden pressed Mr. Obama — who was reluctant to be drawn into mutual escalation with Mr. Putin in Russia’s back yard — to provide Ukraine with more support, like anti-tank Javelin missiles.
But in the memoir, Mr. Biden also recalls agreeing with Mr. Obama that there was only so much the United States could promise to a country whose importance to America is hard to distill.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The president and I agreed that we could and should convince our European allies to support and extend serious economic sanctions against Russia.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But economic sanctions were as far as the United States and its allies in Europe would go,” he wrote.
</span>Ahead of Tuesday’s videoconference, the Kremlin has been signaling one core conviction: Russia cares more about Ukraine’s fate than the West ever will.
In speeches, interviews and lengthy articles, President Vladimir V. Putin and his close associates have telegraphed a singular fixation in recent months on the former Soviet republic. The Kremlin thesis goes that Ukrainians are “one people” with Russians, living in a failing state controlled by Western forces determined to divide and conquer the post-Soviet world.
Ukrainians, who ousted a Russia-friendly president <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> are increasingly in favor of binding their country to Western institutions, would largely beg to differ. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But Mr. Putin’s conviction finds a receptive ear among many Russians, who see themselves as linked intimately with Ukraine by generations of linguistic, cultural, economic, political and family ties.</span> Now, with a force <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 175,000 Russian</span> troops poised to be in position near Ukraine by early next year, in what Western officials fear could be a prelude to an invasion, centuries of shared history loom large.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mr. Putin’s gambit may be a cold calculus of coercion — a way to force President Biden to recognize a Russian sphere of interest in Eastern Europe.</span> But to Mr. Putin, and many other Russians, the nearly eight-year-old conflict with Ukraine is not simply about geopolitics; it is about a hurt national psyche, a historical injustice to be set right. A former Kremlin adviser, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, describes the Kremlin’s view of Ukraine as a “trauma wrapped in a trauma” — the dissolution of the Soviet Union coupled with the separation of a nation Russians viewed as an extension of their own.
“One of the colossal problems pushing us into conflict is that Russian identity does not exist without Ukrainian identity,” said Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Parliament who was the only lawmaker to vote against the Crimea annexation and later fled to Ukraine.
While other conflicts in the post-Soviet world have pitted one ethnic group against another, the one between Russia and Ukraine is more complicated. Ukrainian is Ukraine’s official language, but Russian — which is closely related — is still widely spoken. Russians often view Kyiv, now the Ukrainian capital and once the center of the medieval Kyivan Rus, as the birthplace of their nation. Russian-language writers like Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov came from Ukraine, as did the Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, now speaks Ukrainian in public but first gained fame as a Russian-language comedian who performed across the former Soviet Union.
To many Ukrainians, Mr. Putin’s appeal to a shared history is little but a hollow attempt to appropriate the country’s own heritage and justify territorial ambitions.
“They stole our past,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a pro-Western think tank in Kyiv. “Now they’re trying to steal our future.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">With the large Russian troop buildup on the borders of Ukraine, White House, NATO and European leaders have been working to project a united front to deter the Kremlin and convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that there would be a heavy price to pay in the event of war.
</span>On the eve of his virtual summit with Mr. Putin, President Biden spoke with allied leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain.
“The leaders discussed their shared concern about the Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and Russia’s increasingly harsh rhetoric,” according to a readout from the White House. They called on Russia to de-escalate tensions, the statement said, and agreed that diplomacy was the only way forward.
Even as the leaders issued assurances of solidarity, many European officials are worried that Mr. Putin could respond to pressure by diminishing gas supplies to Europe as winter approaches.
The crisis also comes as Germany is changing leadership and France is facing an election, creating a shifting landscape that the White House fears the Kremlin might move to exploit.
At the Pentagon on Monday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III convened top military and civilian officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the head of the military’s European Command, to discuss the Russian troop buildup.
Officials said that there was an effort underway to send additional defensive weapons, including anti-tank Javelins, to Ukraine, but that they may be kept in position outside the country to avoid giving Mr. Putin a pretext for military action.
Some NATO country officials have counseled against such a move, suggesting that it would not make much difference in the outcome if an invasion should come and could provoke Mr. Putin, rather than deter him.
Given the risks involved, some analysts, like Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argue that Mr. Putin is seeking diplomatic leverage and that the main aim of his troop buildup is not to conquer Ukraine but to get a satisfactory response from the United States.
“Putin is clearly frustrated about being ignored by Washington,” Mr. Trenin said. He noted that Mr. Putin’s earlier troop buildup near Ukraine secured him an early summit meeting with Mr. Biden in June. “This time it will bring Biden to a dialogue on Ukraine and other security issues in Europe.”
But Mr. Trenin said the use of force could not be ruled out.
John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, declined to say whether the United States still had a small number of military advisers in Ukraine or whether the administration had decided to send additional military assistance there.
The Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that “a major war in Ukraine would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">In an open letter to the Atlantic Council, he said that among other major concerns for European society, a war could result in “between three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion” and could seriously disrupt food imports, including of grain, “creating a whole range of food security problems for the entire continent.”
</span>“Russia’s attack would also mark a definitive end to the rules-based international order, opening the door to a new era of global insecurity that would threaten decades of unprecedented peace throughout most of Europe,” he wrote.

Vast amounts of money are being shifted around based on strange and conflicting rules
Aficionados of Tesla Inc. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">TSLA -1.93% were celebrating last week as the electric-car maker was accepted into the S&<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500,</span> propelling its shares <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 22% in</span> two days.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Step back from the extraordinary gains, and the fact that America’s seventh-biggest company by market value is only now to be admitted to the index of the country’<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 500 most</span>-valuable stocks is weird.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But it is only the most obvious of many strange but stock-price-moving ways that indexes rumble markets.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Indexes play two important but often conflicting roles: They measure broad market performance, and they are investment tools.
Start with Tesla.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">It will join the S&<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 next</span> month after a decision by the committee that oversees the index.</span> The same committee had rejected the company in September even after it finally met the index’s qualification condition of being profitable <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 12 months</span>.
Index membership really matters, because there is <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11 trillion</span> indexed or benchmarked to the S&P. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Passive funds will have to buy tens of billions of dollars of Tesla stock—hence, the big move in price.</span> So much money will need to move when the index is reconstituted next month that S&P is consulting on adding the car maker in two chunks.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Again, for both the passive investor and those using the index as a gauge of market performance, this is strange.</span> Why do companies have to be profitable before they are allowed into the index? <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The whole point of investing passively is to leave it up to other people to decide if a company earns enough to justify its stock price.</span> A gauge of performance should measure the profitable and the loss-makers alike. Plenty of companies are loss-making after they join the index, especially this year; it is odd that once in the club, the condition no longer applies.
David Blitzer, who retired as chairman of the S&P index committee last year, says the profitability rule was introduced <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2000 as</span> dot-coms boomed, because a previous “going-concern” condition was seen as too vague.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Other than the profits rule, the fundamentals of a stock were almost completely ignored by the committee.</span> Almost. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“The only time valuations came up is if a stock had a big run up that no one could explain, because no one wanted to put a stock in [the index] and then have it <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">drop 25% the</span> next week,” Mr. Blitzer said.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Tesla stock is up sixfold this year and trading at more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">forecast 2021 earnings</span>.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The profits rule is only the most glaring of many conflicts between an investor tool and a gauge of the market.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Investors want anything that helps performance and eases trading, while a measure of the market should be comprehensive.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 is</span> by design not comprehensive, including only big stocks, but if it can exclude such a huge company as Tesla, what is it for?
</span>The answer, according to S&P’s website, is that it “is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.” In the world of investment, that is pretty much all there is: If everyone uses the S&P as the benchmark, you have to pay attention. As Tesla’s move last week showed, the sheer weight of money means the S&P matters.
This has perverse effects, because other indexes, with different rules, are used elsewhere. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The result is that the same stock can sit in several benchmarks, attracting money from those tracking, say the eurozone, as well as the U.S.—and contributing to the widely used futures tied to those indexes.
Consider TechnipFMC PLC.</span> The British-registered oil-services company is the second-smallest member of the S&P by value, and so is at risk of being booted out next month to make way for Tesla. (It might also stay, as the committee isn’t forced to remove any particular company, any more than it was forced to add Tesla.)
On Wednesday, TechnipFMC—formed from the merger of French and U.S. companies—was one of the best performers in the index. It was also one of the best performers in the Euro Stoxx index, where it is classified as a French company, and in Vanguard’s popular FTSE Europe ETF, where it is also treated as French. So a diversified portfolio using benchmarks from different index providers would probably have TechnipFMC twice—neither of them in the place where it is legally based.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">When index investing got going in the 1970s, this wasn’t a problem because almost all companies were listed in the country where they were registered, based and did most of their business.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Globalization has broken the links, with companies shifting for tax reasons, more cross-border mergers and many multinationals doing most of their business outside their home countries.
</span>“Where a company is listed is pretty much irrelevant in today’s situation,” says Martyn Hole, an investment director at Capital Group, whose Capital International provided the “CI” in MSCI. (They are no longer linked.) <span id=""18"" class=""red"">He says aside from some corporate-governance rules and governmental pressure, stock pickers should focus on where companies make their money, not where they happen to be listed.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The index providers are in a bind, sometimes focusing on listing location, sometimes on legal status, and other times on where a company does its business—in part because of what investors want.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">How have you handled investments in stock indexes this year?</span> Do you plan to follow the same strategy in 2021? Join the conversation below.
MSCI includes foreign-listed companies in its home-country indexes where there are a lot of them, as with Israel, China and the Netherlands. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">There aren’t many German companies listed overseas, so German vaccine maker BioNTech SE, which IPO’d on Nasdaq, doesn’t qualify for MSCI’s German or European indexes.</span> Because it is German, it doesn’t qualify for MSCI USA either. On the other hand, Tesla has been in MSCI’s U.S. indexes <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> because there is no rule on profits.
Most of these problems can be avoided by using very broad global indexes, such as MSCI All Country World or FTSE All-World, which have several large ETFs tracking them. There are still differences in which stocks qualify, notably nonvoting shares, but such an approach does at least avoid the biggest anomalies.
Investors still need to pay attention. There are vast amounts of money being shifted around based on strange and conflicting rules.

81263,"<h3>Switzerland May Be Preparing for the End of the Euro - Breitbart</h3>Something is brewing in Europe now that has the Swiss National Bank worried.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">If you haven’t been paying attention in the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 24 hours</span>, the currency and equity markets have been rocked by a surprise move to delink the existing currency peg between the Euro and the Swiss Franc.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">This move has set off what many are calling a “financial tsunami” that could leave behind a path of destruction across the continent.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Waking up to find that the local Swiss ATM will not dispense Euros may be viewed as a short-term inconvenience to the average man on the street, but learning that depositing your money in a Swiss bond with maturities of less <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 7 years</span> will cost you money, is catastrophic.</span> It is worth repeating, if you lend or deposit your money with the Swiss, they are going to charge you, not pay you.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Negative interest rates are never a sign that things are getting better–quite the opposite.</span> The current yield curve movement indicates a growing concern that things are deteriorating. The further out on the curve the negative rates go, the greater the perceived danger. From the recent moves, many would conclude that Europe is in serious trouble. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Yesterday, the Swiss stock market responded by crashing–experiencing its worse daily drop in over two decades, while its currency skyrocketed.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Central bankers gave the market no advanced warning of this decision, raising the specter of “why now?”</span> What is on the horizon to cause such a drastic move since this non-orderly response is akin to running for the exit in a crowded theater before someone yells “fire”? <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Most currency moves are gradual in nature, like watching a glacier move.</span> This type of disruption has the hallmarks of panic.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Swiss have been trying for years to manage the imbalance of monetary policies across the Euro zone.</span> Linking together nations like Germany and their irresponsible cousin, Greece, has been a recipe for disaster since inception. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The very idea of balanced budgets and fiscal constraint are such foreign concepts among the various participants.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Many would argue that the storm clouds have been building for some time and that the very notion of a lasting unified currency was doomed to fail from the start.</span> The question for most has always been about the timing, and the degree to which Germany, in particular, would continue to carry the other nations who couldn’t stay within the set guidelines of membership. The day of reckoning may be at hand.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Over the last few years, the Swiss balance sheet has ballooned in response to defending their currency, as concerns over the Euro instability grew stronger.</span> First Cyprus, then Greece, and now the overall weakness in many of the EU’s members have many believing that there will be a massive round of quantitative easing unleashed at some future date in response to the deflationary spiral the continent is experiencing. The flight to safety is now on and, for most Europeans, no place is viewed to be safer than Switzerland.
War-gaming this from the sidelines<span id=""11"" class=""red"">, it appears that the Swiss National Bank believes they will be unable to maintain the currency peg given the size of any upcoming stimulus.</span> Rather than stick around and tie themselves to a sinking ship, it is probably best to man the lifeboats and distance themselves as the geopolitical risks mount.
Previously, the Swiss were obligated to continuously purchase unlimited quantities of Euros to maintain <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.20 peg</span> that they decided to implement back in September <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Interestingly, this Euro/Franc peg coincided with the nominal high in gold prices, as the world feared that there were increasingly smaller places to park safe money.</span> This decision was not made haphazardly.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Based on their current balance sheet, this move could cost the Swiss government over <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100 billion</span> dollars.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">This is a move equaling more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15% of</span> its GDP for an economy the size of Pennsylvania.</span> The broken promise made to maintain the peg has been nothing but expensive talk. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The great and powerful central banks of the world have been trumpeting for years that they were omnipotent and more powerful than market forces, but as we have seen, much of their talk has been nothing but smoke and mirrors to placate the public.
</span>The Swiss now look like the architects of the Titanic trying to explain how the policy that they implemented just a few years ago is no longer holding water. After the recent defeat of the gold referendum back in November, the very concerns they gave for not implementing it have now coming home to roost. Gold has been strangely surging ever since the referendums failure. It would be naive to believe that no one outside the SNB knew this was coming.
There is an old joke, “how do you know when a central banker is lying? When his lips are moving.” The next few months will unveil the real reasons for the decision and, more than likely, they will not be for any of the official reasons given today by the Swiss National Bank.
