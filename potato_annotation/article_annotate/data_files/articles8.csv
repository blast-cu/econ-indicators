39418,"<h3>King Abdullah, a Shrewd Force Who Reshaped Saudi Arabia, Dies at 90</h3>King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who came to the throne in old age and earned a reputation as a cautious reformer even as the Arab Spring revolts toppled heads of state and Islamic State militants threatened the Muslim establishment that he represented, died on Friday, according to a statement on state television. He <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 90.</span>
The Royal Court said in a statement broadcast across the kingdom that the king had died early Friday. The royal court did not disclose the exact cause of death. An announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said the king had a lung infection when he was admitted on Dec.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 to</span> a Riyadh hospital.
The king’s death adds yet another element of uncertainty in a region already overwhelmed by crises and as Saudi Arabia is itself in a struggle with Iran for regional dominance.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The royal family moved quickly to assure a smooth transition of power in a nation that is a close ally of the United States, the world’s largest exporter of oil and the religious center of the Islamic faith.</span> In a televised statement, a brother of Abdullah, Crown Prince Salman, announced that the king had died and that he had assumed the throne.
Salman’s ascension appears to signal that the kingdom will preserve its current policies, but he faces exceptional new challenges. Though Saudi Arabia has traditionally preferred to push its agenda through checkbook diplomacy, it has taken a far more muscular approach since the Arab Spring, offering generous support to its allies, like Egypt, while working to oppose adversaries like President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Even as the drop in the price of oil has depleted its own treasury, it has steadfastly refused to cut the supply, hoping to increase market share at the expense of adversaries that are less able to pump oil at low prices.
</span>“As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah’s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship,” President Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. “As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.”
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he was to lead the American delegation “to pay our respects and offer condolences.”
Accidents of birth and geology made Abdullah one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful men. In control of a fifth of the world’s known petroleum reserves, he traveled to medical appointments abroad in a fleet of jumbo jets, and the changes he wrought in Saudi society were fueled by gushers of oil money.
As king he also bore the title of custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, making him one of the faith’s most important figures.
Abdullah had grown accustomed to the levers of power long before his ascension to the throne in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span></span> After his predecessor, King Fahd, a half brother, had a stroke in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 1995,</span> Abdullah, then the crown prince, ruled in the king’s name.
Yet Abdullah spoke as plainly as the Bedouin tribesmen with whom he had been sent to live in his youth. He refused to be called “your majesty” and discouraged commoners from kissing his hand. He shocked <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 7,000 or</span> so Saudi princes and princesses by cutting their allowances. He was described as ascetic, or as ascetic as someone in the habit of renting out entire hotels could be.
Abdullah’s reign was a constant effort to balance desert traditions with the demands of the modern world, making him appear at times to be shifting from one to the other.
When popular movements and insurgencies overthrew or threatened long-established Arab rulers from Tunisia to Yemen <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> he reacted swiftly.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">On his return from three months of treatment for a herniated disk and a blood clot in New York and Morocco, his government <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $130 billion</span> to <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">build 500,000 units</span> of low-income housing, to bolster the salaries of government employees and to ensure the loyalty of religious organizations.
</span>He also created a Facebook page, where citizens were invited to present their grievances directly to him, although it was not known how many entries actually reached him.
But in at least two telephone calls he castigated President Obama for encouraging democracy in the Middle East, saying it was dangerous. And he showed no tolerance for the sort of dissent unfolding elsewhere.
The grand mufti, the kingdom’s highest religious official, proclaimed that Islam forbade street protests. Scores of protesters who failed to heed that message were arrested in the chiefly Shiite eastern provinces. A new law imposed crippling fines for offenses, like threatening national security, that could be broadly interpreted. Reaching beyond his borders, Abdullah sent tanks to help quell an uprising in neighboring Bahrain.
Moves of Moderation
Still, Abdullah became, in some ways, a force of moderation. He contested Al Qaeda’s militant interpretations of the faith as justifying, even compelling, terrorist acts. He ordered that textbooks be purged of their most extreme language and <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sent 900 imams</span> to re-education sessions. He had hundreds of militants arrested and some beheaded.
But he was also mindful that his family had, since the 18th century, derived its authority from an alliance with the strict Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam. He accordingly made only modest changes to the kingdom’s conservative clerical establishment. When Islamic State forces conquered vast stretches of Syria and Iraq, imposing a creed linked to Saudi Arabia’s own, the kingdom was slow to respond.
However, Abdullah chastised senior clerics for not speaking out more forcibly against the jihadists, and he eventually sent Saudi pilots to participate in an American-led campaign against the Islamic State.
Abdullah’s Saudi Arabia had hurtled from tribal pastoralism to advanced capitalism in little more than a generation. The fundamentalist clerics who gave the family legitimacy remained a powerful force. Women who appeared in public without the required covering risked arrest or a beating from the religious police.
Abdullah did make changes that were seen as important in the Saudi context. He allowed women to work as supermarket cashiers and appointed a woman as a deputy minister. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $12.5 billion</span> research university he built and named for himself, women study beside men.
However, he did not fulfill a promise made to Barbara Walters of ABC News in his first televised interview as king in October 2005: that he would allow women to drive, a hugely contentious issue in Saudi Arabia.
Although he ordered the kingdom’s first elections for municipal councils <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> a promised second election, in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2009,</span> in which women would vote, was postponed until <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2011.</span> Then in March of that year, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs announced that the question of women voting would be put off indefinitely “because of the kingdom’s social customs.”
Abdullah’s greatest legacy, however, may prove to be a scholarship program that sent tens of thousands of young Saudi men and women abroad to study at Western universities and colleges. It has been suggested that the changes long resisted by conservative forces — resistance that even a king could not overcome — would one day come about as those men and women rose in the government, industry and academia.
Perhaps Abdullah’s most daunting challenge arrived in the wake of the Sept.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks, with the revelation <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 15 of</span> <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 19 hijackers</span> were Saudis. The royal family at first railed at what it called a vicious smear campaign against the kingdom, then ruthlessly suppressed known militants — not least because the monarchy itself was a main target of Al Qaeda.
Striking a balance was almost always Abdullah’s preference. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He strove to keep oil prices high, but not so high that they prompted consumers to abandon petroleum, then hedged his bets by investing billions in solar energy research.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> he convened a meeting of world religious leaders to promote tolerance, but held it in Madrid rather than Saudi Arabia, where the public practice of religions other than Islam is outlawed.
Yet Abdullah could, and did, take strong positions. He denounced the American-led invasion of Iraq as “an illegal occupation”; proposed a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East that included recognition of Israel by Arab nations; and urged in a secret cable that the United States attack Iran, Saudi Arabia’s great rival. “Cut off the head off the snake,” he said.
His kingdom’s interests always came first. Although American companies discovered and developed the Saudi oil fields, he cut deals with Russian, Chinese and European petroleum companies. He made it clear that the world’s energy appetites mattered less than Saudi Arabia’s future.
A Rigorous Upbringing
Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud was born in Riyadh <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1924 into</span> a vast, complicated family. His father, Abdul Aziz, had as many <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 22 wives</span>.
Abdul Aziz, whose ancestors founded a precursor to the present Saudi state <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1744,</span> chose his wives partly to secure alliances with other Arabian tribes. Abdullah’s mother, Fahda bint Asi al-Shuraim, was a daughter of the chief of the Shammar, whose influence extended into Syria, Iraq and Jordan.
Abdullah was Fahda’s only son. She also had two daughters.
King Abdul Aziz was not an indulgent father to his dozens of sons. He was quoted as saying, “I train my own children to walk barefoot, to rise two hours before dawn, to eat but little, to ride horses bareback.”
When the young Abdullah once neglected to offer his seat to a guest, Abdul Aziz sentenced him to three days in prison.
Abdullah, who overcame a stutter, was educated in religion, Arab literature and science by Islamic scholars at the royal court. From the Bedouin nomads, he learned traditional ways, including horsemanship and desert warfare. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1962,</span> he was appointed commander of the National Guard, which draws recruits from the Bedouin tribes, protects the king and acts as a counterweight to the army.
Four of Abdullah’s half brothers preceded him to the throne.
King Khalid appointed Abdullah as second deputy prime minister <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1975.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1982,</span> Fahd, Khalid’s successor, named him deputy prime minister and crown prince.
After Fahd’s stroke, Abdullah ran the government at first as regent. Political pressures later forced the removal of the regent title, but Abdullah remained the effective decision maker. He refused to sign any official papers with his own name as long as his stricken brother lived. Fahd died on Aug.<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2005.</span>
One of King Abdullah’s first official acts was to pardon two Libyans accused of plotting to kill him, a result of Egypt’s engineering a reconciliation between the two nations. He also pardoned three Saudi academics who were in prison for advocating a constitutional monarchy.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">He went on to establish job-training programs to help ease severe unemployment among educated young Saudis, to develop long-wasted natural gas as a commodity that could be exported, and to bring Saudi Arabia into the World Trade Organization.</span> He became the first Saudi head of state to meet a pope, Benedict XVI, <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007.</span>
Although he reaffirmed his kingdom’s longstanding alliance with the United States, tensions arose with events. Abdullah refused, for instance, to permit American bases on Saudi territory for the Iraq invasion <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> something he had allowed in the first Gulf War.
‘For the Greater Good’
The king also grappled with domestic crises. The deaths <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 girls</span> in a dormitory fire in Mecca <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2002 caused</span> an international uproar when it was learned that the religious police had not let them escape because they were not properly dressed. Furious, the king dismissed the head of women’s education.
<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2007,</span> he pardoned a teenage girl who had been sentenced to six months in jail <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 100 lashes</span> after being raped. She was convicted of being found in a car alone with a man who was not her relative, a crime in Saudi law.
Though Abdullah made it clear that he thought the girl was guilty, pleasing the religious authorities, he pardoned her, he said, “for the greater good.”
In line with Islamic law, Abdullah kept no more than four wives at once, and was married at <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 13 times</span>, said Joseph Kechichian, who studies the royal family as a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.
Abdullah fathered at least seven sons, nearly all of whom have occupied powerful positions as provincial governors and officers in the national guard, Dr. Kechichian said. Of <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 15 known</span> daughters, one is a prominent physician, and another has appeared on television to advocate women’s rights.
Abdullah may have resembled his warrior father, but he had a modern sensibility. A diplomatic cable revealed by WikiLeaks <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 said</span> that he had suggested to an American counterterrorism official that electronic chips be implanted in detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
He said it had worked with horses and falcons, to which the American replied, “Horses don’t have good lawyers.”

Rather than publishing one story this week, we decided to try to capture a bigger picture by featuring numerous voices.

I learned that space and time away from my husband and children is good for everyone, especially me. My husband has started saying “woo!” to everything in quarantine, and it makes me want to scream. My children are amazing and empathetic and annoying. I have to lock the bathroom or they climb into the shower with me or stand next to me while I’m on the toilet. Small breaks: riding the Peloton with headphones on, taking a bath, solo walks, drives to Starbucks and Target runs.

I never fought with my grandparents, but three months of quarantine can change any relationship. Arguments with my grandmother started over my dog’s ban from the kitchen, then moved to the mistakes I’m making in my love life and on to the length of my summer dresses.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Lately we’ve been arguing about the approach to the Black Lives Matter protests: My grandmother’s experience as a Black woman in America, born in rural South Carolina to sharecropping parents, is extremely different from my own, as a Duke University-educated and Microsoft-employed Black woman.</span> I am her wildest dream.
We debate how Black Americans protest police brutality and systemic racism. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">She wants me to stay home, away from the tear gas and rubber bullets, and not speak so candidly to my white colleagues, for fear that I’ll lose my corporate job.</span> I believe the consequences of a peaceful protest don’t outweigh the necessity to make my voice heard.
I moved in with my grandparents after a long-term relationship with my middle school sweetheart ended abruptly in March. I’ve tried online dating — my grandmother swipes on my behalf. I went on a social-distanced date and my grandmother critiqued every outfit.
My grandparents have a 57-year marriage. I thought they had marriage figured out and could teach me, but they don’t. They argue and act childish like most couples. I guess I’m on my own with this marriage thing.
They would probably say living with me for the past three months is the best Covid-19 gift. I not only grocery shop but also introduced them to streaming church on YouTube. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They don’t understand “working from home” and therefore think I’m unemployed.</span> They’re sad to see me go.

I was sick for two weeks in April, though I didn’t get tested for the coronavirus. I learned that I could rely on my husband — briefly. It took two weeks for him to go from very willing to pitch in to noticeably irritated that I wasn’t <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">feeling 100 percent</span> yet.
There was a dark period during my illness where I wished I was back in my parents’ New England home, with no neighbors around, roaming the woods with my child. I realized that ache will never go away and I don’t know what to do about it.
Having a baby in a society that already put much of the child care on the shoulders of the mother, working or not, did in most of our romance long ago. I have also started to feel twinges of anxiety about my decision not to go back to work. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">I don’t regret the choice to stay home with my baby, but job hunting looks even more bleak post-quarantine.

My husband and I rented a 20-foot <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">yurt 11 years</span> ago because we knew it would either teach us to be good communicators or reveal that we were better suited to monkhood. We thought if our marriage could survive sharing such a small space, it could survive anything.
Since social isolation began, we wanted a creative way to deal with conflicts. So we’ve been collaborating on “Broadway in the Yurt” — classic show tunes with a twist. The song “Mood-Altering Foods” — a twist on “Food Glorious Food” from the musical “Oliver” — was born out of my penchant for comfort foods when stressed and Tom feeling that maybe it wasn’t the healthiest way of dealing with things.
We’ve learned that the only thing more conducive to growth than living in a yurt is living in a yurt during quarantine.

My boyfriend and I are accidentally living on an island in Indonesia; we were supposed to be here for just three days when lockdown happened. The island is mostly deserted — virtually all tourists have left, so we are alone all the time.
Eduardo and I had been having a nonexclusive, long-distance relationship for two years and decided to travel around Southeast Asia. When coronavirus exploded, we decided not to go back to our countries (the United States for him, Brazil for me) so we could stay together.
Since lockdown, we’ve had some very intense conversations, sorting out a lot of our past. Issues of jealousy that were never part of our history suddenly became inescapable. We thought about breaking up. But with no boats out of the island and no flights out of Indonesia, leaving was not an option. Now, almost three months later, we’re crazy serious about each other.

Before Covid-19, my brother and I had a bare-bones relationship. With a 10-year age difference, there’s not much we can talk about. But after seeing his addiction to video games since I’ve been home, I’ve entered into the uncharted waters of violently arguing with him about his life’s priorities and then tearfully making up.
In just two months, we’ve shared more tears and hugs than the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 10 years</span> combined. It’s been a time of many firsts — the first time I had a deep conversation with him, the first time I told him a secret and the first time I told him I love him.
After this pandemic subsides, I want to remain actively involved in my brother’s life. I now feel responsible for his well-being, as much as I imagine a parent cares for their child. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Maybe I won’t take a job on the west coast after graduation; maybe I’ll stay on the East Coast to be close.

Before entering this quarantine, my husband and I suffered a miscarriage. I had a dilation and curettage procedure a week before New York City shut down. We had to adjust quickly to our new reality: staying home, losing a pregnancy and my husband getting laid off. I had a hard time sleeping. I’d wake up <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 a</span>.m. on the couch. My husband would find me in the morning and we’d just sit there, holding each other.
My husband is resilient. I would snap at him for being positive about the future or hopeful that we will get pregnant again, feeling like it was too soon. I realized that’s just him, though. Positivity is how he grieves.
The last couple of months have allowed us time to grieve in a way we normally wouldn’t have. I was scheduled to return to work a few days after the procedure.
We started having conversations with our families and friends, opening up about what had happened. People told us stories of their own losses and their friends’ losses. Even though we were stuck at home, we felt love and support from the outside world. Randy and I have come a long way during this time — now, we accept our loss as part of our story.

We went from seeing each other on weekends at goth and rock clubs — and enjoying maybe one lazy day after — to this. We actually haven’t fought much. So many L.A. relationships are superficial, and I sometimes feared ours was too. But it’s not. Our proximity has proved to me than our relationship is more than sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.
Overall, we communicate more deeply than we did before this pandemic. The best part has been learning more about each other’s true nature. When I’m feeling down, I don’t need to speak or explain. Tony reaches his arms out to hold me and suggests we take a drive to see the ocean.
Our one-year anniversary is today, but we’ve chosen to take a week apart for personal space. It feels healthy and right, because my apartment is so small.

Because we have so much more time together, we indulge in sex almost daily, and the fact that he can and that I want to has amazed me. Even better, he comes out of the study throughout his work day to kiss me, and makes a point of starting his day exercising with me and ending it snuggling. We sing and dance like teenagers.

Before this, we rarely raised our voices and were both quick to apologize. It seems our good communication has broken down. Usually we are both noncombative, but when you have to face a harsh reality every day, it’s hard to ignore or make excuses.
He always said a major reason for the distance in our relationship was that I worked too much. But now that we have all of this time together, it’s been detrimental to our relationship. There have been a few bright spots. I was having a bad day and he knew I had been craving a McFlurry, so he went out and got one for me with extra M&Ms. It reminds me to keep the compassion alive.
But when our lease is up, we will not be living together anymore, and I will be moving across the country. This time has been revealing not only for my relationship but for the whole structure and meaning of my life.

Living with her 2½-year-old daughter.
I’m a single mom. My daughter splits half her time with her father, but the hardest day was when I allowed her to watch television for five hours so I could work, but I really just sat on the floor staring, unable to do anything.
I’m a professor at a university, and it was difficult just ending the semester, without support or day care. Things got really tough. But I found that when I hit what seems to be my bottom, I just keep going.

‘The perfect time to create something new’
Ariana Shapiro,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 26
New</span> Haven, Conn.
Living with her boyfriend, who will join her lease in June.
I get lost on endless Zoom calls. Some days I hear a sharp knock on the door of my home office and look up to see my boyfriend mooning me, his cheeks pressed tight against the glass door, just out of sight of the camera. It lifts my spirits.
In March we started collecting food from our neighbors and distributing it to families in need. We weren’t ready to move in before, but we are now. We started a mutual aid network together and we talk about what’s next: A worker’s cooperative? A political campaign? A nonprofit? We realized that this is the perfect time to create something new.

Apple struck back on Monday in the keynote speech of its Worldwide Developers Conference. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">It unveiled Apple Music, which combines a subscription-based, on-demand streaming-music service, a 24-hour global Internet radio station, and a service for artists to connect with listeners.

</span>It also introduced an app called News, which will be included in a forthcoming update to its iOS mobile software that launches this fall. News combines articles from news organizations including ESPN, the New York Times and Condé Nast, presenting them in a single format in the style of a digital magazine.

Apple has at least one other content service in the works—a streaming TV service that wasn’t announced on Monday, but could arrive before the end of the year.

“It’s interesting to see Apple trying to retake control of content,” said technology analyst Jan Dawson, who runs Jackdaw Research. “It feels like Apple has been in limbo, adrift in the last few years. Music went to streaming. Video went to subscriptions and Apple sat back and watched that happen.”

Together, the initiatives highlight Apple’s role at the intersection of media and technology. Once a pioneer, Apple now risked falling behind, as with music. Shares of Apple <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">slipped 85 cents</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $127.80 on</span> Monday, but have <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">risen 16% this</span> year.

Apple is moving to reassert itself amid changes in how consumers watch television, read news and listen to music, while seeking to leverage its hundreds of millions of iTunes accounts and hundreds of millions of smartphones and tablets in consumers’ hands.

“There is this idea of appealing to a new generation with music,” said Horace Dediu, founder of research firm Asymco. “And this generation doesn’t buy music, they stream it.”

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Apple said its streaming-music subscription service will <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $9.99 a</span> month after a three-month trial period, similar to Spotify’s ad-free tier.</span> Families will be able to share a single account for up to six members <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $14.99 a</span> month.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president who oversees Internet services and software, said it reached an agreement with the three major music labels before the announcement.

In a second music move, Apple said it plans to launch a live radio station, <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Beats 1.</span> It will <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">broadcast 24 hours</span> a day with DJs in Los Angeles, New York and London, and be available in more <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 countries</span>. Apple will also offer genre-specific stations, ranging from indie rock to classical, created by other DJs.

“The vast majority of people in the world don’t subscribe to music, so we think there is a real opportunity,” said Mr. Cue in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “We’re trying to do something that’s bigger than streaming, that’s bigger than radio.”

Apple said its Music service, which will be available on Apple devices <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> will be offered on devices running Google Inc.’s Android operating system later this year.

With News, Apple aims to give users a single spot to find news from a variety of publishers instead of sifting through individual apps.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Cue said Apple aims to help news organizations—many which are financially strapped—to publish articles in appealing layouts that work well for mobile devices.

</span>The Apple initiative comes on the heels of Facebook Inc.’s launch last month of a news partnership called Instant Articles in which publishers ranging from NBC News to National Geographic post their stories directly in Facebook’s newsfeed, rather than linking readers back to their own sites.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Apple said its arrangement will allow publishers to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">keep 100% of</span> the revenue from ads they sell themselves <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 70% of</span> ad revenue generated by Apple’s iAd platform.

</span>Apple also introduced a feature called proactive assistant in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">iOS 9,</span> the next version of its mobile-operating system aimed at making its devices smarter. Apple said the feature will suggest apps to launch or people to contact based on past usage. In addition, it will learn things over time such as a user’s music preferences.

The feature is somewhat similar to Google Now, which aims to give users relevant information at the moment it is most useful. Apple sought to distinguish its service from Google by saying the information will be processed on the user’s device, won’t be shared with advertisers and isn’t linked to other Apple services.

Beyond media, Apple also used the two-hour-plus keynote presentation to announce expansions of its Apple Pay mobile-payments service and enhancements for its newest device, the Apple Watch.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company said it is expanding Apple Pay to accept cards from Discover Financial Services Inc., as well as branded cards from certain retail stores.</span> Early participants among stores include department-store chains Kohl’s Corp. and J.C. Penney Co., and warehouse club BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The company also said it is extending Apple Pay next month to the U.K., where it will be accepted at more <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 250,000 locations</span>, including the London transportation system.

For Apple Watch, the company announced a major software update—less than two months after the first Watches went on sale. The biggest change is the ability for apps to run natively on the Watch. Until now, Watch apps have had to run on an iPhone, which slowed performance of some apps.

25786,"<h3>China’s credibility on the line as yuan slides again, global markets slump</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">BEIJING — China’s currency slid for a second day on Wednesday, sending more shockwaves through global financial markets and raising fresh questions about the credibility of the country’s economic management.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The surprise moves by China to allow more market forces to set currency rates — an effective devaluation at the moment — have also deepened speculation about the true strength of the world’s second-largest economy after recent jolts including a stock market plunge.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The sense that the Communist Party was an almost infallible steward of the nation’s economy took a battering during the stock crash in June and July.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A few weeks later, China’s economic data — showing growth steady <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 7 percent</span> despite widespread signs of a slowdown — were widely derided by analysts as inaccurate and overblown.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Now, fresh concerns have surfaced about the stewardship of the central bank after a shock decision to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting exchange rates.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Over two days, China’s currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, was <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 3.5 percent</span>, sparking headlines about a global currency war and threatening to fan trade tensions with the United States.
</span>[China devaluation of yuan prompts U.S. outcry]
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The currency shake-up has spilled far beyond China to drag down world financial markets.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Dow Jones industrial average was <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 1.3 percent</span> at midday Wednesday — after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">shedding 1.2 percent</span> on Tuesday — but it recovered in the afternoon, erasing its losses and edging into positive territory.</span> European exchanges took a beating for a second day, led by <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.4 percent</span> drop in France’s <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CAC 40 and</span> a <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 3.3 percent</span> fall in Germany’s DAX.
China’s central bank set a central rate for the yuan on Wednesday <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.3306 to</span> the dollar, slightly below the previous day’s closing rate. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The yuan then slid further during onshore trading to close <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 6.3870 to</span> the dollar.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">On Tuesday, the bank said it would adjust the mechanism by which it sets the yuan’s central rate to give the market a greater role.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The yuan can then <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">trade 2 percent</span> higher or lower than that central rate.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">While experts said some of the criticism could be wide of the mark, the People’s Bank of China may now have a tough job on its hands to prevent the currency's decline from spiraling.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">[China’s remedy to slowing economy: cheaper currency]
“The central bank’s credibility will be put to the test,” said Andrew Polk, resident economist at the Conference Board China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">“After the recent flubbing of the stock market fall, this is arguably a somewhat dangerous course of action.”
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">China’s decision to free up its exchange rate appeared to come in response to repeated urging from the International Monetary Fund — as well as from the United States.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It appeared designed, experts said, to bolster the case for the yuan’s acceptance as a global reserve currency, and specifically its inclusion in the Special Drawing Rights basket alongside the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">But the move was also probably timed to support the nation’s slowing economy and critical export sector.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Many economists agree the currency had become overvalued, and efforts to keep it stable had kept domestic interest rates higher and monetary policy tighter than economic conditions warranted.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">[What the Chinese devaluation means for the world economy]
The yuan hit a four-year low on Wednesday, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaching 6.45 to</span> the dollar within China and as low <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 6.59 in</span> international trade.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Ironically, Japan and the euro zone have overseen much sharper depreciations in the yen and euro, respectively, this year as part of efforts to stimulate their economies, but they have escaped without the volley of criticism from U.S. politicians that greeted China's decision Tuesday.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">In China, senior Commerce Ministry official Zhang Yuzhong was reported as saying on Wednesday that the currency’s decline would help exports — a backbone of the Chinese economy.
</span>Reuters news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying there was “growing clamor within government circles” to allow further depreciation in coming months for that reason.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">But trying to manage a steady decline in a currency can be a dangerous game, said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG in Melbourne, explaining that expectations of depreciation will only encourage more capital outflows.
</span>“If they get this wrong, it can go bad,” he said. “They need to plant a seed — that speculators are not going to get their own way, that at some stage there is going to be stability, and that ‘we will be there.’”

While investor George Soros was famously said to have “broken” the Bank of England <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1992 by</span> speculating against the pound and forcing sterling out of Europe’s Exchange Rate Mechanism, the People’s Bank of China is unlikely to face anything like those pressures and has a much stronger hand in the form <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $3.</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 65 trillion</span> in foreign exchange reserves.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Still, the bank will have to keep its “fingers crossed,” said Chen Long, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, who sketched out three scenarios.
</span>The worst scenario is that the yuan continues to slide, perhaps <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">toward 7 to</span> the dollar. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">That would put enormous downward pressure on other Asian currencies, raise a further firestorm of criticism in the United States about efforts to steal American jobs, and give substance to those alarmist “currency war” headlines about nations engaging in competitive devaluations to boost their economies.
</span>The central bank also could do a U-turn and give up on the idea of letting markets determine the exchange rate, which would also damage its credibility.
<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Or the currency could stabilize in a day or two, Chen said.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Foreign exchange traders told wire services that state-owned banks began selling dollars on Wednesday on behalf of the People’s Bank of China to help stem the currency’s slide.
</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">“Looking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan,” the central bank said.
</span>But markets have a habit of overshooting. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">China’s stock market has lost around a quarter of its value since a mid-June peak after <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 150 percent</span> in the previous year.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">In an effort to stabilize that market, the authorities damaged their own standing by taking extreme measures, banning major shareholders from selling shares and launching criminal investigations into “malicious” short-sellers.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Arthur Kroeber, managing director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said this week’s move to a market-driven exchange rate would be good for China and the world in the long term, supporting the government’s efforts to reform its economy and its intention to give markets a “decisive role” in allocating resources.
</span>But the timing is problematic, he wrote in a note on Wednesday.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">“The currency is being let off the leash right at the moment when market sentiment on China is pessimistic because of a continuing economic slowdown, an increase in private capital outflows, and entrenched producer price deflation,” he wrote.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">“Market confidence was also shaken by the authorities’ clumsy intervention to prop up the stock market after the popping of the equity bubble in June.”
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“In this context it is no surprise that many traders and analysts have interpreted the currency move — wrongly, in our view — as a last throw of the dice by a government panicking about an economy in free-fall.”</span>"

May</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017

WASHINGTON</span>—President Donald Trump’s tough talk on Mexico might have had an unintended effect: Fear of a trade war pushed down the value of the Mexican peso, increased the U.S.’s appetite for subsequently cheaper Mexican goods and widened the U.S. trade deficit with its southern neighbor, the opposite of Mr. Trump’s objectives.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The U.S. posted <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $7 billion</span> trade deficit in goods with Mexico in March, the highest since <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2007,</span> the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $28.1 billion</span> in Mexican products shipped across the border—including cars, avocados and other items—marked a high.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The trade deficit with Mexico <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">leapt 14% in</span> the first quarter this year compared with the first quarter <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016.</span></span> That is due at least in part to a decline in the peso. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The currency is down <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6% against</span> the dollar over the past year and more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% since</span> Mr. Trump’s November election win, even after a rebound in recent months.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump pledged during his campaign to make Mexico pay for a border wall, and he has repeatedly threatened to revamp or even cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement as part of broader plans to reinvigorate U.S. factories.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1994 pact</span></span> among the U.S., Mexico and Canada lowered tariffs and other barriers on a host of goods.

<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1994 pact</span></span> among the U.S., Mexico and Canada lowered tariffs and other barriers on a host of goods.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Revamping the treaty could ultimately hurt Mexican exports, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 80% of</span> which go to the U.S.

</span>But in the near term, the peso’s drop has made it less expensive for American firms to buy Mexican goods in dollars.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The strong dollar, meanwhile, has curbed demand for U.S. exports, said Eduardo González, an economist at Citibanamex in Mexico City.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Trump administration called the widening of the trade gap with Mexico alarming.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The United States can no longer sustain this inflated trade deficit with our closest trading partners,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The Trump administration is committed to rebalancing our trade relationships in order to protect American workers and businesses from lopsided trade relationships,” Mr. Ross added.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The rise in the deficit could be temporary.</span> The peso has rebounded in recent months, and Mr. Trump recently backed off a threat to pull out of Nafta, indicating that the administration would seek mostly modest changes to the agreement in talks with Mexico and Canada.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trading partner in goods, and the factories of the two nations are closely intertwined.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Among the biggest buyers of Mexican goods in the U.S. are manufacturers importing parts for their products.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Likewise, parts exported from the U.S. make up <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40% of</span> the value of Mexico’s manufactured exports.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">In this way, improving health of U.S. factories, who are benefiting from steady demand domestically and abroad, is another factor likely driving up the deficit with Mexico.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The top Mexican exports to the U.S. are cars, machinery and medical equipment, according to the U.S. trade representative.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">In Mexico, manufactured exports, which make <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 90% of</span> the country’s total exports, were <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 9.2% in</span> the first quarter from the year-earlier period <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $83.6 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">More than a third of the exports were autos and auto parts, although exports of processed food and electronics goods have also seen strong growth.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">Overall, the U.S. trade gap with other countries has widened this year compared with a year earlier, in a sign of a steadier global economy.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expanded 7.5% in</span> the first quarter compared with the same period <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 as</span> exports and imports each climbed <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7%,</span> the Commerce Department said.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">With the world grappling with rising prices, a tour through Argentina reveals that years of inflation can give rise to a truly bizarre economy.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Supported by
Jack Nicas and
Jack Nicas and Ana Lankes, correspondents in South America, spent two weeks traveling around Buenos Aires to understand how Argentines have adapted to years of high inflation.
</span>BUENOS AIRES — Eduardo Rabuffetti is an Argentine who has been to the United States once, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 1999 honeymoon</span> in Miami. Yet he probably knows <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 bill</span> better than most Americans.
He says he can pick out a counterfeit by touch. He can tell you exactly <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">what $100,000 looks</span> like. (Ten half-inch stacks, small enough to hold in one hand.) And on numerous occasions, he has walked down the streets of Buenos Aires with tens of thousands of U.S. dollars tucked into his jacket.
That is because Mr. Rabuffetti, a property developer who has built two office towers and a house here, bought the land for each of those buildings <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $100 bills</span>.
“Here, if you don’t actually see the money, nobody signs anything,” he said. “After the number of crises we’ve been through, let’s just say you get used to it.”
It is not just Mr. Rabuffetti. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Nearly every big purchase in Argentina — land, houses, cars, expensive art — is done in tall stacks of U.S. currency.</span> To save up, Argentines stuff bundles of American bills into old clothes, beneath floor boards and in bombproof safe deposit boxes past nine locked gates and five stories beneath the ground.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Argentines hold so much U.S. currency — experts believe perhaps more than anywhere outside the United States — sometimes it gets thrown away by mistake.</span> Last month, passers-by found tens of thousands of dollars blowing around at an Argentine dump.
The dollar is king in Argentina because the Argentine peso is disintegrating in value, particularly over the past month. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">One year ago, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 180 pesos</span> could <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy $1 on</span> the widely used black market.</span> Now it <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">takes 298 pesos</span> to buy a buck. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">With the peso plummeting, prices are soaring to keep up.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Many economists expect inflation here, already <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 64 percent</span> this year, to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit 90 percent</span> by December.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">It is one of the country’s worst economic crises in decades, and that is saying something for Argentina.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">As countries across the world try to cope with rising prices, there is perhaps no major economy that understands how to live with inflation better than Argentina.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The country has struggled with rapidly rising prices for much of the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 50 years</span>.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">During a chaotic stretch in the late 1980s, inflation hit a nearly <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">unbelievable 3,000 percent</span> and residents rushed to snatch up groceries before clerks with price guns could make their rounds.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Now high inflation is back, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeding 30 percent</span> every year <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">To understand how Argentines cope, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurateurs, realtors, barbers, taxi drivers, money changers, street performers, street vendors and the unemployed.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The economy is not always the best conversation starter, but in Argentina, it animated just about everyone, eliciting curses, deep sighs and informed opinions about monetary policy.</span> One woman happily showed off her hiding spot for a wad of U.S. dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed cash into her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress wondered whether she had immigrated to the right country.
One thing became strikingly clear: Argentines have developed a highly unusual relationship with their money.
They spend their pesos as quickly as they get them. They buy everything from TVs to potato peelers in installments. They don’t trust banks. They hardly use credit. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">And after years of constant price hikes, they are left with little idea of how much things should cost.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Argentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to fathom almost anywhere else in the world.</span> Life is especially manageable for those with the means to make the upside-down system work. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">But all those striking workarounds mean that few who have held political power during years of economic distress have found themselves paying a real price.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">“We ask ourselves the same thing: How is society allowing these things to happen?” said Juan Piantoni, the head of Ingot, a safe-deposit-box company where business is booming as Argentines pay to stash their cash.</span> “At this moment, I think we’re on the eve of a situation that could lead to a major crisis,” he added. “No one has lit the fuse yet. But the day that happens, we’ll see what we’re up against.”
So far, things have remained largely calm. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Wages for many jobs are rising at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 50 percent</span> a year.</span> Landlords can raise rents at similar rates. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">And millions of Argentines use the black market to evade government restrictions on buying U.S. dollars.
</span>The result is that in the wealthier areas of Argentina’s capital, construction continues apace and restaurants and bars are packed. The next dinner reservation for two at Anchoita, one of the city’s hippest restaurants, is in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2023.</span>
In poorer neighborhoods, people collect scrap cardboard to sell, pool their money for food and swap used goods to avoid the peso altogether. <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Argentina’s poor typically don’t have jobs with automatic wage increases, and they certainly don’t have extra cash to buy U.S. dollars.</span> That means they are left making few pesos while everything around them gets much, much more expensive. <span id=""22"" class=""red""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 37 percent</span> of Argentines now live in poverty, up <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 30 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">8 Signs That the Economy Is Losing Steam
Worrying outlook.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Amid persistently high inflation, rising consumer prices and declining spending, the American economy is showing clear signs of slowing down, fueling concerns about a potential recession.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Here are other eight measures signaling trouble ahead:
On <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> Argentina’s economic minister resigned.</span> Over the <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 26 days</span>, the peso’s value <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 26 percent</span>. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">Then President Alberto Fernandez fired the new economic minister.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It was the 21st time that an Argentine economic minister lasted two months or less.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Argentina’s recent bout with hyperinflation is linked to the same things that have driven up prices worldwide, including the war in Ukraine, supply-chain constraints and big increases in public spending.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">But many economists believe Argentina’s inflation is also self-inflicted.</span> In short, the country spends far more than it takes in to fund free or deeply subsidized health care, universities, energy and public transportation. To make up for the shortfall, it prints more pesos.
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund, which is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owed $44 billion</span> from Argentina, has asked the government to cut its deficit and pass stricter monetary policies.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, the new minister, Sergio Massa, made one of the most significant steps in years when he pledged that Argentina would stop printing pesos to fund its budget.
</span>Yet many Argentines were skeptical that the country was ready to make the tough choices necessary.
“We might need the patient to have a heart attack before the family says, ‘Let’s do the surgery,’” said Hugo Alconada Mon, one of the country’s top investigative journalists and a best-selling author who spent almost the last of his savings recently on car repairs. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">“But how many people will end up in poverty because of that?</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">How many people will leave the country?”
Abandoning price tags
Argentines are hoping the current moment does not spiral into a disaster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 2001,</span> when there was a run on the banks.
</span>That year, it became clear that foreign investors believed the Argentine peso was worth far less than the government’s official rate, and Argentines rushed to get their money before it was lost. Instead, the government halted withdrawals — and then gave them all a haircut, reducing everyone’s savings in a sudden devaluation. The president resigned and left the government offices in a helicopter to avoid the angry crowds in the regal square out front, Plaza de Mayo.
Two decades later, the angry crowds are still in Plaza de Mayo. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Thousands of Argentines gathered there last month to protest the soaring inflation.
</span>Ana Mabel was on the outskirts of the crowd, mixing peanuts and caramelized sugar in a metal vat. She was selling bags of candied peanuts <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 200 pesos</span> each, or <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70 cents</span>; she had <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">charged 150 pesos</span> a week earlier. But that increase hardly kept up with her costs. Everything she needed had gotten pricier in just the past few weeks: the peanuts, the sugar, the oil, the gas tank, and the plastic baggies to package the treat. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">She has five children to support, and for the first time, she had taken on debt.
</span><span id=""36"" class=""red"">“Nothing regulates the prices,” she said, frustrated, slowly turning the peanuts in the vat.</span> “The businessmen don’t want it. The government can’t. And that all falls on us.”
For Argentines, it is an old story. <span id=""37"" class=""red""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> prices had risen so much that Argentina doubled the size of its largest bank note <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1,000 pesos</span>, then worth <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $58 on</span> the black market.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Now that note is worth <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.45 </span>— about the price of a Big Mac.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">An iPhone can now cost more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1 million</span> pesos.
</span>Many Argentines have lost their bearings on value. Menus are constantly changed. Taxi meters are frequently adjusted. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">And price tags are often outdated.
</span>Oscar Benitez runs a meticulously organized hardware store the size of a large walk-in closet. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">He <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">sells 80,000 different</span> products, and he hardly knows the price of any of them.
</span>That is because they change every few days, updated in a running list sent by his suppliers that he checks on his computer for every sale. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">He has largely abandoned price tags.
</span><span id=""43"" class=""red"">He shows a pair of scissors that the supplier says should now <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost 600 pesos</span>.</span> “A month ago, it was <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 400 pesos</span>,” he said, consulting his list. “A year ago, it was <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 120 pesos</span>.”
He looked exasperated. “It’s sad. But for me, it was always like this,” he said. “If I wasn’<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">t 51 years</span> old, I’d be in the United States, which is what I’m now trying to make happen for my daughters.”
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Prices are fluctuating so much that in recent weeks many companies have halted sales to see where prices settle, making it difficult to find certain items, including cooking oil and car parts.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Some farmers are also holding onto their wheat and soybeans, betting prices will rise — and blunting the economic benefits of a commodity boom that should benefit an exporter like Argentina.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">At a small shop in downtown Buenos Aires, Noelia Mendoza was selling her last stock of toilet paper.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">Her suppliers said they had no more, so she had raised her prices.</span> <span id=""48"" class=""red"">A pack of four single-ply rolls now <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost 290 pesos</span>, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $1,</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from a month earlier.</span> “There is going to be a shortage,” she said.
Her friend standing nearby, Carla Cejas, chimed in: “I never understood the bidet until now.”
A duffel bag full <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10,000 </span></span>$100 bills
Ignacio Jauand, a 34-year-old publicist, buys everything he can in installments, including his bed, his clothes, a <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">PlayStation 5 and</span> a potato peeler.
It’s not that he can’t afford them. It’s that he’s betting the value of the peso will fall. <span id=""49"" class=""red"">If he’s right, his final payments cost significantly less.</span> That bet, he said, has always paid off. <span id=""50"" class=""red"">“The last installment I paid for the TV or the fridge cost two or three McDonald’s combos,” he said.
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">“Buying stuff is how you beat inflation,” he added.
</span>That is the mantra of Argentina. Pesos disintegrate in value, so you better spend them as quickly as you can.
<span id=""52"" class=""red"">People go out to eat or buy appliances, art or cars, while shop owners stock up on inventory, betting prices will only go up.</span> <span id=""53"" class=""red"">“When I think of my savings in pesos, I say, ‘Let’s pay for a trip, let’s renew something in the house, let’s buy stuff,’” said Eduardo Levy Yeyati, an Argentine economist and visiting professor at Harvard University.</span> “Otherwise I feel like I’m losing money every day by keeping it in the bank.”

<span id=""59"" class=""red"">Argentina’s central bank estimates that Argentine households and nonfinancial firms hold more <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $230 billion</span> in foreign financial assets, mostly denominated in U.S. currency.</span> Most of that money is held in international bank accounts, but some is also stashed in safes and hiding places across the country.
<span id=""60"" class=""red"">That dependence on the dollar is bad for the peso, so the government restricts Argentines from buying more <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 in</span> U.S. currency each month.</span> For that amount, Argentines can use the official government exchange rate, which says each U.S. dollar is worth <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 130 pesos</span>.
<span id=""61"" class=""red"">But a different exchange rate — used for Western Union wires, certain corporate transactions, and the black market — values the peso at less than half that: Each dollar is now worth <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 300 pesos</span>.</span> <span id=""62"" class=""red"">(Because this rate is a truer measure of the open market’s view of the peso, we used it to convert values in this article.)
</span>In downtown Buenos Aires, men and women dubbed “arbolitos,” or little trees, stand on street corners hawking dollars. They lead buyers to so-called caves to change the money in private.
It’s all illegal, but police standing nearby don’t seem to mind. <span id=""63"" class=""red"">Many use the market themselves.
</span>Juan, a money changer who delivers wads of cash on his motorbike, said three of his regular customers are police officers. Even so, he agreed to speak on the condition that only his first name be used.
<span id=""64"" class=""red"">Money changers and cave managers estimated the black market <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">moves $3 million</span> <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $4 million</span> a day.</span> <span id=""65"" class=""red"">Those dollars underpin much of the economy here.
</span>Yanina Arias, a Buenos Aires real-estate agent, said she has completed hundreds of deals over her 10-year career, but never one in pesos. Sellers often require “dollar bills without stains, without rips, and that are big-faced,” Ms. Arias said. “Small-faced bills are not accepted.”
The face in question is Benjamin Franklin’s. <span id=""66"" class=""red"">The black market generally <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offers 3 percent</span> more for <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">newer $100 notes</span> with Mr. Franklin’s enlarged portrait because they are harder to counterfeit.
</span>Seven Argentines described paying for properties in cash, but few were willing to allow their names to be printed because they were worried about being audited.
To head to the bank to close the deal, they described stuffing tens of thousands of dollars down their pants and into grocery bags full of produce. Ms. Arias said wealthier people have hired armored trucks.
<span id=""67"" class=""red"">A financial-services worker in Buenos Aires said that when she sold her family’s farm <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1 million</span> a few years ago, the buyer handed her a duffel bag full <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10,000 </span></span>$100 bills.</span> Later, when she bought her apartment, she <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">put $100,000 of</span> the cash into the pockets of an oversized coat and hustled to the buyers’ home. The sellers, an older couple, insisted on counting each bill by hand.
<span id=""68"" class=""red"">Trading milk for diapers
After Adela Castillo and her husband lost their jobs during the pandemic — she was a caretaker and he worked in shipping — they took a big risk.</span> They converted their home in one of Buenos Aires’s poorest neighborhoods into a shop selling cement, limestone, paint and plasterboard.
At first, it was paying off. <span id=""69"" class=""red"">The government was building new affordable housing in the neighborhood, and it became a big buyer.</span> To keep up, she needed a forklift. And to buy one, she <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">needed $15,000 in</span> cash.
A bank would never make that kind of loan, but luckily, she had a family friend who had that much stashed away. “A huge favor,” she said. “Nobody lends you money like that.”
She bought the forklift. “It helped a ton,” she said. Then the value of the peso continued to plummet. “He wants me to pay back in dollars. He doesn’t want pesos,” she said. <span id=""70"" class=""red"">With each decline in the value of the peso, her debt has effectively grown bigger.
</span>“It’s a screwed-up situation,” she said, standing outside her shop, limestone dust in her hair and down her fleece. She was not sure how she would pay it off. “We’re treading water,” she said. “We’re fighting.”
With the peso losing so much value, some poor Argentines are trying to avoid it altogether.
Silvina López,<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 37,</span> was standing in the biting cold with her infant. She needed diapers but she was broke. After a stroke, Ms. López was blind in one eye and didn’t work, while her husband was a construction laborer when it was sunny. <span id=""71"" class=""red"">But his wages — <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $7 a</span> day — hadn’t increased while the prices did.
</span>But here, next to a bus stop in the poor suburb of Lomas de Zamora, she didn’t need pesos. <span id=""72"" class=""red"">Instead, she had sacks of powdered milk, handouts from the government that she could trade in order to make sure her 1-month-old, Milagro, or Miracle in Spanish, had diapers.
</span>Another woman had set up shop on the street corner to barter, and she traded Ms. López a 12-pack of diapers, two bags of sugar and a box of cookies for the powdered milk. Ms. López’s 8-year-old daughter, Mia, immediately tore into the cookies.
“My family, my siblings, they all come here,” she said. “They have lots of children, too.”
During the recession that accompanied <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2001 run</span> on the banks, a half-million people were regularly meeting in so-called “trueque” clubs, or bartering exchanges, to swap goods without pesos. <span id=""73"" class=""red"">The clubs largely disintegrated over the years, but with inflation again soaring, they are making a comeback.
</span>On a recent Sunday, <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 100 people</span> hustled among two dozen tables, swapping their wares: used clothes, cleaning supplies, homemade pizza dough, insecticide, fried quince pastries. <span id=""74"" class=""red"">To facilitate the trades, they used “créditos,” the club’s own currency, printed onto white paper.
</span>Women clutched handfuls of the notes as they shopped at their neighbors’ tables. They all said they preferred the crédito to the peso.
At one point, an organizer who was selling Avon makeup, Karina Sanchez, paused the cumbia music to make an announcement: They were exchanging older, smaller denomination créditos for newer, larger ones. She showed much older notes worth one-half a crédito. Last year, they introduced <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1,000</span>-crédito note.
<span id=""75"" class=""red"">Yes, Ms. Sanchez said, the crédito was experiencing inflation, too.

54618,"<h3>Meet the Biggest Prankster in Baseball: Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman</h3>Before <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 2 of</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2019 American</span> League Championship Series last October, the Yankees’ third-base coach, Phil Nevin, was sitting at a table in the visiting team’s food room at Minute Maid Park. A clubhouse attendant appeared and told Nevin he had a visitor waiting in the hallway: Alex Cintron, the hitting coach of the Houston Astros.
This was alarming: During <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Game 1 the</span> day before, the Yankees had shouted angrily at the Astros because they heard whistling coming from the vicinity of the Houston dugout. (This was before the Astros admitted to, and were penalized for, cheating in previous seasons, but opponents had long been suspicious.)
Whether the whistling was simply gamesmanship or something more nefarious, Nevin didn’t like it, or how Cintron was behaving. So he had sent a threat to Cintron — something about meeting anyplace at any time to settle a score — via Astros third baseman Alex Bregman.
But when Nevin burst through the clubhouse doors, Cintron wasn’t there. Instead, it was Yankees Manager Aaron Boone and General Manager Brian Cashman, who was the prank’s mastermind, with cellphones out to capture it on video.
“I couldn’t stop laughing after that,” Cashman said. “When he walked out, he had his game face on.”
<span id=""0"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">For 23 years</span>, Cashman has held one of the most high-profile and demanding jobs in sports: the Yankees’ general manager.</span> In that span — much of it under George Steinbrenner, the exacting and fiery owner who died <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 </span>— the Yankees have <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 2,131 regular</span>-season games, more than any other franchise in the major leagues; reached the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">playoffs 19 times</span>, including this year; and claimed four World Series titles, the last coming <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009,</span> an eternity in the Bronx.
Cashman,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 53,</span> is also highly accomplished in another category: pranks. Many inside the Yankees’ organization — from the principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, George’s son, to the Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera — have stories about being on the receiving end of a Cashman practical joke.
“He’s one of the best at it,” said Jim Hendry, the Yankees’ special assistant scout and a former Chicago Cubs general manager.
Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame outfielder who is now a Yankees special adviser, added, “He’s always trying something.”
Making personnel decisions for one of the most valuable pro sports franchises in the world can be stressful, and Cashman has used his pranks to defuse tension or produce a few smiles amid it all — especially during a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">challenging 2020 season</span> complicated by the pandemic.
“It’s just something that feels like it could lighten the load,” Cashman said. “Bottom line: Every day is a day of importance, so any day you can have fun while you’re doing fun work. I just like to have fun.”
Cashman’s mischievous streak dates at least to college, he said. One of the earliest pranks he remembered pulling with the Yankees, with whom he started full time <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> came when he was an assistant general manager, a position he held <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1992 to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1998.</span>
From a blocked number, Cashman called one of his mentors and favorite targets, Gene Michael, the former Yankees general manager and manager whose work had laid the foundation for four World Series teams. The Florida Marlins had a managerial opening, so Cashman, disguising his voice and posing as a Miami Herald reporter, told Michael — a scout for the Yankees at the time — that he was on a shortlist for the position.
“Oh man, it was like hook, line and sinker,” Cashman said. “He goes: ‘I certainly can’t comment on that. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But off the record, of course I would have interest.’</span> I started laughing, and he was like: ‘Who is this? Who is this?’ I told him. I was crying because I was laughing so hard.”
Cashman couldn’t recall exactly why he had targeted Michael — probably revenge for a joke Michael had at his expense, he said. Cashman, after all, has pulled so many pranks over the years he can’t remember every one.
“The more august he has gone into his general managership, he doesn’t do those nasty, vicious ones,” said the Yankees assistant general manager Jean Afterman, who added that Cashman has joked with her but “would never dare” prank her, because she could easily get him back.
Afterman, though, has helped Cashman with some of his mischief. Cashman had once been using a cheap machine that produced fake flatulence, and she bought him a higher-quality one she called “the <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fartmaster 4000.</span>” (Cashman has burned through many of those.) He hid the device in the visiting players’ lounge at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 World</span> Series and watched from an adjacent room.
“In a moment when he felt that everybody was serious, he had the remote in his hand and pushed the button,” said Billy Eppler, a former Yankees assistant general manager who was most recently the Los Angeles Angels’ general manager.
During <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2005 winter</span> meetings, an annual baseball convention, Cashman deployed both a flatulence machine and a little trickery on reporters who were interviewing him in a hotel suite. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Cashman intentionally left a piece of paper on a coffee table with a fictional trade proposal with the Milwaukee Brewers that said something along the lines of: “We get Ben Sheets.</span> They get Robinson Cano and Chien-Ming Wang.”
Thinking he had a scoop, Mark Feinsand, who covered the Yankees for MLB.com, placed his notebook on the paper and planned to discreetly follow up with Cashman afterward. “I had to do the big reveal because I didn’t want him to write a false story,” Cashman said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Cashman has used the fake trade bit on his employees, too.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He once changed the contact information in his cellphone for a rival general manager so that he could trick Matt Ferry, the Yankees’ director of baseball operations, into thinking he had completed a trade that Ferry opposed.</span> In reality, Cashman was simply texting himself.
“It’s just naturally part of his personality,” Eppler said. “He just has a really good understanding of tone and timing. He knows there’s times to be serious and times we can laugh a little bit. He understands that’s a good medicine.”
Planning for the annual draft can be one of the more stressful tasks for the Yankees’ front office, said Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees’ vice president for domestic amateur scouting. But when Cashman arrives every year to the team’s facility in Tampa, Fla., Oppenheimer said, he can put people at ease with his laid-back attire (flip flops, T-shirt and shorts) and his humor.
Around the time of one draft, Oppenheimer said, Cashman used the flatulence machine on him while they were ordering dinner at a restaurant.
“You have to tell the waitress because she’s not going to say anything,” Oppenheimer said, laughing, “but you’re like, ‘This is what we deal with.’”
Cashman said he was fair game for pranks, too. Afterman said she once pranked Cashman years ago with a fake waiver claim for a player who was owed a lot of money.
Phillies Manager Joe Girardi, who was the Yankees’ manager <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2008 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> said he “always” got Cashman back but only vaguely elaborated. “Some of the same things he did to me,” Girardi said.
Pranks have been harder to pull off this season with so many front office staffers working remotely, Cashman said. But recently, when Matt Daley, a director of pro scouting, who lives in New Jersey, went to Yankee Stadium for a meeting held mostly on Zoom to go over the team’s potential playoff opponents, Cashman had a rare in-person target.
So Cashman said he sneaked out of his office and tossed party snaps — the type that make firecracker-like sounds — into the conference room where Daley was sitting during the video call.
Eppler said he had also been the target of party snap blitzes during presentations, as well as a clicker pen that shocks users. Cashman occasionally gave it to him when he was signing official documents.
“I’ve probably forgotten half the stuff I’ve pulled,” Cashman said.
He did remember, though, a few he had inflicted on players. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">He was the architect behind the drafting of a prank letter from the Internal Revenue Service to Rivera <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> the final season of the pitcher’s 19-year career, about a payment owed on behalf of his charity.
</span>“He was so nervous because the number was so astronomical,” Cashman said.
Cashman said he once gave the former outfielder Nick Swisher a prank scratch lottery ticket that produced <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $50,000 winner</span>. (He told Swisher he had picked it up at a gas station on the way to Yankee Stadium that day.) Swisher, in the middle of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $27 million</span> contract, raced up and down the hallways in delight at his apparent good fortune.
The instructions on the back read: “Claim forms supplied by Santa Claus. All winning tickets must be validated by the Tooth Fairy and conform to her game rules.” (Cashman keeps these and the party snaps in his office desk.)
As he told his side of Cashman’s prank at the Astros’ ballpark, Nevin insisted he wasn’t looking for a fight with Cintron when he charged through the clubhouse doors last October. He said he expected to have a discussion, “not to knock each other out.”
He still laughs about the practical joke and hinted that he might get Cashman back one day.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“He does a good job of mixing the professionalism with having fun with the guys, staff and players,” Nevin said.</span> “It makes us all better. We all do it in here. It’s nice when your leader is the same kind of personality.”"

For those <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">whose 2015 calendar</span> includes a retirement party, it’s time to get to work.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Even for potential retirees who have spent years planning and saving, there’s a to-do list that needs attention to ensure finances are running smoothly.
</span>Before collecting that final paycheck, new retirees need to make important decisions. And it’s not just money. There’s also the issue of how people are going to fill their time in a rewarding way.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“You don’t want to see people just stepping off a cliff into the big unknown,” says Cheryl Sherrard, director of financial planning at Clearview Wealth Management in Charlotte, N.C.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Planning and talking about the things that are ahead will make for a much smoother transition.”
Social Security
For many retirees, their first step when leaving their full-time job is to sign up for Social Security payments.</span> That could also be their first mistake.
More Sunday Journal
Here’s why: Delaying Social Security at least until full retirement age (which is gradually increasing to age 67)—or, even better, until age 70—results in larger benefit payments. For example, for those eligible for full retirement benefits at <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 66,</span> waiting until <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 70 will</span> bring monthly payouts equal <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 132% of</span> the regular monthly benefit.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“It’s hard to overstate how important this is,” says Cheryl Costa, financial planner at Forteris Wealth Management in Framingham, Mass.</span> “People shouldn’t fall into the trap of, ‘I have to file now because it’s free money.’ ”
Ms. Costa encourages retirees to visit a local Social Security office in person to see what their exact benefits would be. One option is what’s known as a “file and suspend” for the higher-benefit spouse, which could result in a higher benefit for the lower-benefit spouse until the higher-benefit spouse takes full benefits at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 70.</span>
Medicare and Health Care
Even if a retiree isn’t filing for Social Security benefits, he or she needs to sign up for Medicare at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">age 65 or</span> risk higher premiums.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It’s important to understand what your coverage will be, what some of your out-of-pocket expenses are going to be,” says Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price Group .
</span>Many retirees are surprised to learn Medicare doesn’t cover vision and dental, which is often costly for older adults. Out-of-pocket expenses for medication can be much higher with Medicare than under many corporate health plans.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Budgeting
More broadly, people approaching retirement should assemble a detailed income and spending budget.</span> It should include setting aside funds for inevitable emergencies or one-off big expenses, such as replacing a car.
Often this is a source of worry. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But David Lewis, a financial planner at Resource Advisory Services in Knoxville, Tenn., says he has seen both sides of the coin: instances where retirees have to tighten their belts—and cases where retirees are in better shape than they thought.</span> Either way, “the sooner you can figure that out, the better,” he says.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Ms. Costa suggests retirees live on their expected budget for at least six months before they stop working to see if it’s realistic.</span> “People generally ‘low ball’ their [spending] estimates,” he says, “and while it might make their projections look better, it doesn’t do anyone any good if the plan fails right out of the gate.”
At the same time, retirees—in the first years after leaving the office—should expect to adjust their budgets as they settle into their new lifestyle. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The earlier big adjustments are made—such as downsizing to a small, less-expensive home—the bigger the effect on household finances.
</span>Lifestyle
Again, dollars are only part of the pre-retirement equation. “Many times people haven’t thought about the nonfinancial sides of retirement,” says Ms. Sherrard.
Retirement can be a big change for those whose lives revolved around work. Ms. Sherrard encourages potential retirees to think deeply about how they’ll stay engaged and have a meaningful life—over a span <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 or</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 years</span>.
“A lot of people feel, ‘Oh, I’m going to play golf and tennis, and those kinds of activities,’ ” she says. “But when you have somebody sit down with an entire week that is blank… they’re at a loss for how they fill that time.”

94542,"<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady, Says Economy Is Strong</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Central bankers’ optimistic economic outlook points to a rate raise at their next meeting

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 4</span>:58 pm ET

WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady Wednesday and offered an upbeat assessment of the economy’s performance, suggesting another interest-rate increase is likely at its next meeting.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Fed repeatedly emphasized the economy’s strength in a statement released after its two-day policy meeting.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It offered nothing to dispel market expectations that it would deliver its third interest-rate increase of the year when it meets in late September.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,” the statement said.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In all, the Fed’s rate-setting committee used the word “strong”—or a derivative of it—six times to describe the economy and labor markets.

</span>Officials voted in June to raise their benchmark rate to a range <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.75% and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span> They voted unanimously on Wednesday to leave it there for now.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall U.S. economic output expanded at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.1% annual</span> rate in the second quarter, the best three-month increase <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2014,</span> the Commerce Department reported last week.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">During the first half of the year, the economy expanded at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.1% annual</span> rate, slightly better than <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2.8% median</span> forecast for the full year submitted by Fed officials in June.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The question looming over the Fed’s meetings this spring and summer has centered on how much further officials believe they will need to raise rates over the next two years.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">In June, Fed officials penciled in plans to raise rates two more times this year and three times next year, which would push their benchmark rate <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 3%.</span></span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Officials estimate that moving rates about that level would effectively be tapping brakes on economic growth.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Traders in futures markets largely agree with the Fed’s outlook.</span> On Wednesday, they placed a <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 90% chance</span> of a rate increase this September and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 70% chance</span> of at least one more increase by December, according to CME Group.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The challenge for central bankers is to lift borrowing costs enough to prevent the economy from overheating but not so much that it tips into recession.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Inflation is close to the Fed’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span> after undershooting it for many years.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Consumer prices in June <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.2% from</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Excluding volatile food and energy categories, they <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.9%,</span> according to the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed likes to maintain inflation <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 2%,</span> seeing it as a sign of a balanced economy.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The threat of trade disputes, meanwhile, has added another layer of uncertainty to the Fed’s forecasts.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Wednesday’s statement made no mention of trade policy.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">By raising goods prices, tariffs could result in slightly higher inflation, though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated the Fed would look past such one-time price increases.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">A stronger dollar could also offset some of these effects by making it cheaper for Americans to buy foreign goods, pushing down import prices.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">A slowdown in global growth that spills back into the U.S., on the other hand, could prompt the Fed to reconsider its rate-rise plans.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Although we believe the move toward protectionism is a material threat to corporate profits and the economy, we think the Fed’s plan is unlikely to change,” said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities and co-head of multiasset investing for Lazard Asset Management.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Stronger U.S. economic growth over the past year hasn’t resulted in accelerating price pressures even though unemployment has dipped to levels officials believe should force employers to raise wages and prices.

</span>Mr. Powell offered a mostly bullish assessment over two days of congressional hearings last month. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Pressed over whether inflation was more likely to be higher or lower than expected, he said he was “maybe slightly more worried about lower inflation,” given the long period in which inflation defied Fed forecasts that predicted an imminent return to<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2%.</span>

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The Labor Department is set to report on July hiring this Friday.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">In June, the unemployment rate ticked up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.8% in</span> May despite strong employment gains, reflecting a surge of new workers who hadn’t been actively looking for work.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">This week’s Fed meeting was the first since President Trump last month signaled his unhappiness with the Fed’s rate-increase campaign, though Mr. Trump said he wouldn’t interfere with their plans.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, have said they won’t react to political pressure and made no mention of it Wednesday.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump said on Twitter last month the Fed’s efforts to slowly raise interest rates from unusually low levels “hurts all that we have done” to boost economic growth.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">In effect, Mr. Trump signaled his desire to enlist the Fed in his broader campaign to narrow trade deficits.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Those efforts could be undermined if higher interest rates in the U.S. raise the value of the dollar against other currencies.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">A stronger greenback makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive in world markets.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump regards bilateral trade deficits as important benchmarks of economic vitality, though most economists don’t see it that way.

</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump’s own policies also have contributed to the stronger dollar because they are boosting growth and raising budget deficits, which places upward pressure on the U.S. currency.

</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">A Trump administration official told The Wall Street Journal last month the White House was comfortable with one more rate increase this year—but not two.

55115,"<h3>Both Sides Harden Positions on Anniversary of Nazi Defeat in Europe</h3>Both Sides Harden Positions on Anniversary of Nazi Defeat in Europe
PARIS — On a day of commemoration of the end of World War II in Europe, the war in Ukraine was marked by posturing and signaling on Sunday, as each side ramped up its rhetoric and resolve.
Leaders of the world’s wealthiest democracies vowed to end their dependence on Russian energy and ensure that Russia does not triumph in its “unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal aggression,” as President Vladimir V. Putin pursued his indiscriminate bombardment of eastern Ukraine and orchestrated celebrations for Russia’s Victory Day holiday on Monday.
A statement by the Group <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 major</span> industrialized nations said that on a day when Europe recalled the devastation of World War II and its millions of victims, including those from the Soviet Union, Mr. Putin’s “actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.”
The leaders, signaling to Mr. Putin that their unrelenting support of Ukraine would only grow, said, “We remain united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war against Ukraine.” The memory of all those who fought for freedom in World War II, the statement said, obliged them “to continue fighting for it today.”
The tone was firm, with no mention of any potential diplomacy or cease-fire.
In Moscow, as fighter jets streaked across the sky and nuclear weapons were put on display in preparation for Victory Day, Mr. Putin appeared to signal back to Western leaders that he was determined to double down on the war until he could conjure something that might be claimed as victory.
There was fresh evidence of that on Sunday, as rescuers picked through the rubble in Bilohorivka, a village in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine where a Russian bomb had flattened a school building the day before, killing people sheltering there, local authorities said.
“Most likely, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 60 people</span> who remain under the rubble are now dead,” Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. But it was unclear how many people were in fact in the school and that toll may prove inflated. If confirmed, it would be one of the deadliest single Russian attacks since the war began in February.
Despite the World War II commemorations in most of Europe on Sunday and in Russia on Monday, a painful reminder of the tens of millions of people killed, there was no indication that the war in Ukraine was anywhere near ending. If anything, all signals pointed in the opposite direction. Russian attacks on Ukrainian towns and villages met a crescendo of Western rhetoric, accompanied by the constant danger of escalation.
Mr. Putin, whose steady militarization of Russian society in recent years has turned the <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 9 celebration</span> of the Soviet defeat of the Nazis into an annual apotheosis of a resurgent nation’s might, is expected to portray a war of repeated setbacks in Ukraine as a successful drive to “de-Nazify” a neighboring nation whose very existence he denies.
His much-anticipated speech may go further, possibly signaling that whatever conquest in Ukraine there has been up to now will become permanent through annexation. Russia annexed Crimea <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 and</span> began stirring military conflict in the eastern Donbas region.
In Mariupol, the Ukrainian port city now in ruins after sustained Russian assault, and a place Mr. Putin wants to showcase as evidence of his “victory,” the city’s last Ukrainian defenders vowed to fight on. Russian forces were cleaning the streets on Sunday in possible preparation for a celebratory parade on Monday.
Across eastern Ukraine, Russia appeared intent on making its occupation permanent through Russian flags, Russian-language signs and the introduction of the ruble. The Group <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 leaders</span> said any attempts “to replace democratically elected Ukrainian local authorities with illegitimate ones” would not be recognized.
Visits to the region by the first lady, Jill Biden, who crossed into western Ukraine to meet Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, in an unannounced visit to Uzhhorod, and by Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who appeared unexpectedly in a war-scarred suburb of Kyiv, were clearly intended to drive home a message of unwavering Western commitment.
Senior American diplomats returned to the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv for the first time since the war began.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine released a black-and-white video address on Sunday marking the Allied victory <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> Standing in front of a destroyed apartment block in a Kyiv suburb hit hard by Russian troops before their withdrawal from the region around the capital, he said, “We pay our respect to everyone who defended the planet against Nazism during World War II.”
Mr. Putin has portrayed Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, as the leader of a nation threatening Russia with revived Nazism. His aim has been to instill the spirit of the Great Patriotic War, as World War II is known in Russia, among Russian troops, but to little apparent avail.
In the vast Azovstal steel mill that is the last remaining part of Mariupol not under Russian control, Ukrainian troops again rejected Russian deadlines to surrender. In a virtual news conference, Lt. Illya Samoilenko, an officer in a Ukrainian National Guard battalion known as the Azov regiment, said: “We are basically dead men. Most of us know this. That is why we fight.”
Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the regiment, said, “We don’t have much time, we are under constant shelling,” with attacks from Russian tanks, artillery, airplanes and snipers.
The remaining civilians in the steel plant were evacuated on Saturday. Local officials estimate the death toll in the city at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 20,000.</span>
If the United States and its allies have refused to commit military forces for fear of sparking World War III, they have moved to support Ukraine in every other way, their determination mounting and their actions expanding with each Russian atrocity.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The Group <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 statement</span> included a series of economic, military and judicial steps, with the apparent aim of bringing the Russian economy to its knees and increasing the pressure on Mr. Putin to turn back from a war of choice that has turned him into a pariah and threatens much of his country’s progress over the past two decades.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“We commit to phase out our dependency on Russian energy, including by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil,” the statement said.</span> It added, without being specific, that this would be done in a “timely and orderly fashion.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Alternative sources, they added, would be found to ensure “affordable prices for consumers.”
Russia-Ukraine War: Key Developments
A show of support.</span> In a high-profile display of solidarity with Ukraine on the eve of a key Russian military holiday, Jill Biden, the first lady, made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine. Canada’s leader, Justin Trudeau, also made an unannounced trip to the Kyiv suburb of Irpin.
It was unclear how this commitment from the Group <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7 went</span> beyond existing undertakings, if at all.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The 27-nation European Union has already committed to a complete import ban on all Russian oil, with most countries phasing out Russian crude oil within six months and refined oil by the end of the year.</span> The European Union is too dependent on Russian gas to consider banning it in the short term.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The war has already driven up gasoline prices across much of Europe in a generally inflationary climate.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">If the war drags on for a long time, it is likely that support for the West’s commitment to Ukraine may waver among consumers paying the cost at the pump or in their utility bills.
</span>The statement of the Group <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7,</span> meeting remotely, said the seven nations — the United States, France, Britain, Japan, Germany, Canada and Italy — had already provided or <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pledged $24 billion</span> to Ukraine <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2022.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“In the coming weeks, we will step up our collective short-term financial support,” they said.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“We will continue to take action against Russian banks connected to the global economy and systematically critical to the Russian financial system,” they added.</span> More generally, they would “take measures to prohibit or otherwise prevent the provision of key services on which Russia depends.”
Military and defense assistance would continue to ensure that “Ukraine can defend itself now and deter future acts of aggression.”
The leaders said they would “spare no effort to hold President Putin” and his accomplices “accountable for their actions in accordance with international law.”
The charges of illegality leveled at Mr. Putin for the invasion of a sovereign country are certain to anger the Russian president. The NATO bombing of Belgrade <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999 during</span> the Kosovo War, the United States invasion of Iraq <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003 and</span> Western support for the independence of Kosovo <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008 have</span> given him a healthy distrust of American invocations of the United Nations Charter and international law.
War raged in Ukraine’s east on Sunday, with a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, gaining ground in the northeast. However, the Ukrainian army withdrew from the city of Popasna after two months of fierce fighting.
In general, the planned Russian offensive in the east of the country, like the rest of Mr. Putin’s war, has gone less well than planned. Mr. Putin’s broad aim, at least for the time being, seems to be to connect Crimea through Mariupol to other occupied areas in eastern Ukraine, and to Russia itself, forming a cohesive and strategic swath of territory.
William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the current phase of the war was at least as dangerous as Russia’s initial attempt to attack the capital and topple the Ukrainian government.
Speaking on Saturday in Washington, he said Mr. Putin was “in a frame of mind that he thinks he cannot afford to lose,” and was convinced that “doubling down still will enable him to make progress.”
In <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 77 years</span> since the end of World War II, the possibility of a broad conflagration in Europe has seldom, if ever, appeared more plausible.

44045,"<h3>Workers Seeking Productivity in a Pill Are Abusing A.D.H.D. Drugs</h3>Fading fast <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11 p</span>.m., Elizabeth texted her dealer and waited <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 30 minutes</span> for him to reach her third-floor New York apartment. She handed him a wad of twenties and fifties, received a tattered envelope of pills, and returned to her computer.
Her PowerPoint needed another four hours. Investors in her health-technology start-up wanted re-crunched numbers, a presentation begged for bullet points and emails from global developers would keep arriving well past midnight.
She gulped down one pill — pale orange, like baby aspirin — and then, reconsidering, took one of the pinks, too.
“O.K., now I can work,” Elizabeth exhaled. Several minutes later, she felt her brain snap to attention. She pushed her glasses up her nose and churned <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 7 a</span>.m. Only then did she sleep <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 90 minutes</span>, before arriving at her office <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.</span>
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The pills were versions of the drug Adderall, an amphetamine-based stimulant prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that many college students have long used illicitly while studying.</span> Now, experts say, stimulant abuse is graduating into the work force.
Reliable data to quantify how many American workers misuse stimulants does not exist, several experts said.
But in interviews, dozens of people in a wide spectrum of professions said they and co-workers misused stimulants like Adderall, Vyvanse and Concerta to improve work performance. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Most spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or access to the medication.
</span>Doctors and medical ethicists expressed concern for misusers’ health, as stimulants can cause anxiety, addiction and hallucinations when taken in high doses. But they also worried about added pressure in the workplace — where the use by some pressures more to join the trend.
“You’d see addiction in students, but it was pretty rare to see it in an adult,” said Dr. Kimberly Dennis, the medical director of Timberline Knolls, a substance-abuse treatment facility for women outside Chicago.
“We are definitely seeing more than one year ago, more than two years ago, especially in the age range <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 25 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 45,</span>” she said.
Elizabeth, a Long Island native in her late 20s, said that to not take Adderall while competitors did would be like playing tennis with a wood racket.
“It is necessary — necessary for survival of the best and the smartest and highest-achieving people,” Elizabeth said. She spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her middle name.
Most users who were interviewed said they got pills by feigning symptoms of A.D.H.D., a disorder marked by severe impulsivity and inattention, to physicians who casually write prescriptions without proper evaluations. Others got them from friends or dealers.
Obtaining or distributing stimulants without a prescription is a federal crime, but the starkest risks of abuse appear to be overdose and addiction.
<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2013 report</span> by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that emergency room visits related to nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adults 18 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34 tripled</span> <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2005 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">almost 23,000.</span>
The agency also reported that <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2010 to</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> people entering substance rehabilitation centers cited stimulants as their primary substance of <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">abuse 15 percent</span> more often than in the previous three-year period.
Just how stimulants like Adderall might improve work performance, and to what extent, remains a matter of scientific debate.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">But many young workers insist that using the drugs to increase productivity is on the rise — and that these are drugs used not to get high, but hired.
</span>“Given the increase in rates of abuse in college students over the last decade, it is essential that we understand the outcomes as they leave college and assume adult roles,” Dr. Wilson Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an interview.
Immediate Impacts
Elizabeth’s sleep tracker was confused. Her nightly rests were so brief, the iPhone software thought they were just naps. It recorded her average sleep over nine months: from 4:17 a.m. until 7:42.
After founding her own health technology company, Elizabeth soon decided that working hard was not enough; she had to work harder, longer. Sleep went from an indulgence to an obstacle.
So she went to a psychiatrist and complained that she could not concentrate on work. She received a diagnosis of A.D.H.D. and a prescription for Adderall in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10 minutes</span>, she said.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Friends of mine in finance, on Wall Street, were traders and had to start <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5 in</span> the morning on top of their games — most of them were taking Adderall,” Elizabeth said.</span> “You can’t be the one who is the sluggish one.”
Researchers in the field are quick to caution that, despite stimulants’ reputation as “smart pills,” few studies suggest that they improve a person’s ability to learn or understand. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">But they often improve attention and motivation, particularly for tedious tasks, which can increase productivity — or at least the appearance of it.
</span>Some industries have banned the use of stimulants for reasons of safety or fairness. The Federal Aviation Administration forbids pilots to use the medications under any circumstances. Major League Baseball players and other athletes had long abused amphetamines to increase focus and endure exhausting travel schedules, but the drugs are now considered performance-enhancers allowed only with a confirmed A.D.H.D. diagnosis.
Interviews with people who have misused the pills showed them to be a diverse group. A dentist in eastern Pennsylvania prescribed herself Adderall and other stimulants for years because, she said in a telephone interview, she could <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">see 15 patients</span> a day rather <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 12.</span>
Lisa Deese of Fishers, Ind., said she had abused Adderall as a stay-at-home mother of three for years. The pills, she said, “were like mommy crack.”
“I got so much more done during the day,” she added. “I was hooked by my first pill.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">While many studies have assessed the prevalence of misuse among college students, no doctor or researcher contacted for this article could cite a formal assessment of misuse among adults to improve job performance.
</span>But Dr. Anjan K. Chatterjee, the chairman of neurology at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and an expert in the field of cognitive enhancement, said that even without conclusive data, misuse was undoubtedly rising. “Kids who have been using it in high school and college, this is normalized for them,” Dr. Chatterjee said. “It’s not a big deal as they enter the work force.”
A Slow Realization
Sitting in a conference room at Timberline Knolls, the treatment facility, and hearing the details of Elizabeth’s professed harmless misuse of Adderall, a New York native in her mid-20s said pointedly, “That was <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">me 17 days</span> ago.”
The woman said her road to addiction had begun at her East Coast college, where Adderall was readily available from classmates <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $5 or</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $10 a</span> pill, she said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">When her postgraduate job involved extensive early-morning driving and detailed paperwork, she began taking more.</span> She said friends in accounting and teaching were doing the same thing.
“Everything was just —” she said, snapping her fingers loudly. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“I did my job faster than anybody.</span> I was on a mission, and I was not going to stop until I succeeded and got what I wanted.”
When she became too wired to relax or sleep, she added the tranquilizer Xanax to calm herself. She tried to stop taking Adderall, she said, but “became terrified that I couldn’t perform without it.” She turned to alcohol, then cigarettes and other prescription drugs to modulate her intensifying mood swings, before entering Timberline for five weeks.
The number of stimulant misusers who become addicted is unclear. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But supply has risen sharply: <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 2.6 million</span> American adults received A.D.H.D. medication in<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> a rise <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 53 percent</span> in only four years, according to Express Scripts, the nation’s largest prescription-drug manager.</span> Use among <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adults 26 to</span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 34 almost</span> doubled.
Most experts say a proper evaluation for the disorder typically requires an extensive inquiry into a patient’s history of impulsivity and inattention. Yet misusers routinely described brief chats with doctors to get a prescription. Two lawyers in Houston said wearing a suit to their appointments guaranteed no scrutiny.
Those lawyers said they and dozens of young colleagues at their firms had casually traded pills to work into the night and billed hundreds of extra hours a year in the race for partnerships.
One said he had originally <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">taken 20 milligrams</span> of Adderall a day, moving up <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100 milligrams</span> — almost double the highest dose recommended by the Food and Drug Administration — by getting prescriptions from multiple doctors, a felony in Texas. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">His productivity, he said, thrilled his unquestioning bosses and clients.
</span>Then came the downside: rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating and acute anxiety due to sleep loss. These overwhelmed any positive effects on his work performance, he said, and transformed his personality to the point that his wife divorced him. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">After he lost his job, he spent six weeks at a drug treatment center.
</span>“It’s a crutch, and it becomes a crutch immediately,” said the lawyer, who recently joined a smaller firm in Texas.
In her New York apartment, where floor-to-ceiling white boards were scribbled with nascent projects, Elizabeth considered what her generation appears willing to swallow for success.
“It’s like this at most of the companies I know with driven young people — there’s a certain expectation of performance,” she said, banging away on that PowerPoint presentation as her own pills kicked in. “And if you don’t meet it, and I’m not really worried how, someone else will.”"
69969,"<h3>Germans Forget Postwar History Lesson on Debt Relief in Greece Crisis</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">As negotiations between Greece and its creditors stumbled toward breakdown, culminating in a sound rejection on Sunday by Greek voters of the conditions demanded in exchange for a financial lifeline, a vintage photo resurfaced on the Internet.
</span>It shows Hermann Josef Abs, head of the Federal Republic of Germany’s delegation in London on Feb.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1953,</span> signing the agreement that effectively cut the country’s debts to its foreign creditors in half.
It is an image that still resonates today. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">To critics of Germany’s insistence that Athens must agree to more painful austerity before any sort of debt relief can be put on the table, it serves as a blunt retort: The main creditor demanding that Greeks be made to pay for past profligacy benefited not so long ago from more lenient terms than it is now prepared to offer.
</span>But beyond serving as a reminder of German hypocrisy, the image offers a more important lesson: These sorts of things have been dealt with successfully before.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The 20th century offers a rich road map of policy failure and success addressing sovereign debt crises.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The good news is that by now economists generally understand the contours of a successful approach.</span> The bad news is that too many policy makers still take too long to heed their advice — insisting on repeating failed policies first.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“I’ve seen this movie so many times before,” said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who is perhaps the world’s foremost expert on sovereign debt crises.
</span>“It is very easy to get hung up on the idiosyncrasies of each individual situation and miss the recurring pattern.”
The recurring, historical pattern? <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Major debt overhangs are only solved after deep write-downs of the debt’s face value.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The longer it takes for the debt to be cut, the bigger the necessary write-down will turn out to be.
</span>Nobody should understand this better than the Germans. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">It’s not just that they benefited from the deal in<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1953,</span> which underpinned Germany’s postwar economic miracle.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Twenty years earlier, Germany defaulted on its debts from World War I, after undergoing a bout of hyperinflation and economic depression that helped usher Hitler to power.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">It is a general lesson about the nature of debt.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Yet from the World War I defaults of more than a dozen countries in the 1930s to the Brady write-downs of the early 1990s, which ended a decade of high debt and no growth in Latin America and other developing countries, it is a lesson that has to be relearned again and again.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Both of these episodes were preceded by a decade or more of negotiations and rescheduling plans that — not unlike Greece’s first bailout programs — extended the maturity of debts and lowered their interest rate.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But crises ended and economies improved only after the debt was cut.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">In a recent study, Professor Reinhart and Christoph Trebesch of the University of Munich found sharp economic rebounds after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1934 defaults</span> — which cut debtors’ foreign indebtedness by at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 43 percent</span>, on average — and the Brady plan, which sliced debtors’ burdens by an average <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 36 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">“The crisis exit in both episodes came only after deep face-value debt write-offs had been implemented,” they concluded.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings.”
</span>Policy makers have yet to get this.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">This is true even at the International Monetary Fund, which was created after World War II to deal precisely with such situations.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Its approach to the European debt crisis, five years ago, started with the blanket assertion that default in advanced nations was “unnecessary, undesirable and unlikely.”</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">To justify this, it put together an analysis of the Greek economic potential that verged on fantasy.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Even as late as <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2014,</span> the I.M.F. held that the government in Athens could take <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">out 3 percent</span> of the Greek economy this year, as a primary budget surplus, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 4.5 percent</span> next year, and still enjoy an economic growth surge to <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4 percent</span> pace.
</span>How could it achieve this feat? Piece of cake. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Greek total factor productivity growth only had to surge from the bottom to the top of the list of countries using the euro.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Its labor supply had to jump to the top of the table and its employment rate had to reach German levels.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">The assumptions come in shocking contrast to the day-to-day reality of Greece, where more than a quarter of the work force is unemployed, some three-quarters of bank loans are nonperforming, tax payments are routinely postponed or avoided and the government finances itself by not paying its bills.
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Peter Doyle, a former senior economist at the I.M.F. who left in disgust over its approach to the world’s financial crises, wrote: “If ‘optimism’ results in serial diagnostic underestimation of a serious problem, it is no virtue: At best, it badly prolongs the ailment; at worst, it is fatal.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Creditors, of course, do not generally like debtors to write down their debt.</span> But that’s not how Germany and its allies justify their approach. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">They rely instead on a “moral hazard” argument: If Greece were offered an easy way to get out of debt, what would prevent it from living the high life on other people’s money again?</span> What kind of lesson would this send to, say, Portugal?
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">But the Greek economy has shrunk by a quarter.</span> Its pensioners have been impoverished. Its banks are closed. That counts as suffering consequences. No sane government would emulate the Greek path.
Germany, in fact, understands moral hazard backward. The standard definition refers to lenders; covering their losses will encourage them to make bad loans again. And that is, let us not forget, exactly what Europe’s creditors have done. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Their financial assistance to Greece was deployed to pay back German, French and other foreign banks and investors that held Greek debt.</span> It did Greece little if any good.
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Greece has done little to address its endemic economic mismanagement.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">But it has few incentives to do so if the fruits of economic improvements will flow to its creditors.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">A charitable explanation of the strategy of Greece’s creditors is that they feared Europe’s financial system was too fragile <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span> when Greece’s insolvency first became apparent, to survive a write-down of Greek debts.</span> Greece, moreover, was not an outlier but one of several troubled European countries that might have followed the same path.
<span id=""31"" class=""red"">But Adam S. Posen, who heads the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says he thinks it has more to do with political cowardice.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Greece’s creditors were not prepared to take a hit from a Greek debt write-down and then explicitly bail out their own banking system.</span> So they resorted to what Mr. Posen calls “extend and pretend.”
“There’s an incredibly strong incentive not to recognize losses,” Mr. Posen told me. <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Governments “will do things that are more costly as long as they don’t appear as a line-item on the budget.”
</span>There is a slim case for optimism. Today, the risk of contagion from Greece is low, Professor Reinhart says. Other peripheral European countries are in better shape. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">And even the I.M.F.’s economists recognize that there may be no way around a Greek write-down.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">The cost to Europe’s creditors would be minuscule.
</span>Yet Germany has not come around. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">It took a decade or more from the onset of the Latin American debt crisis to the Brady deal.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Brazil alone had six debt restructurings.</span> Similarly, the generalized defaults <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1934 followed</span> more than a decade of failed half-measures. Does Greece have to wait that long, too?
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">An earlier version of this column described incorrectly the period of time in which Brazil had six debt restructurings.</span> It was the 1980s and 1990s, not the 1990s."

14784,"<h3>Trump’s State Visit to the U.K.: Live Updates</h3>Here’s what you need to know:
Moments before arriving, Trump took aim at London’s mayor.
President Trump arrived at Stansted Airport, north of London, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 9 a</span>.m., but even before setting foot in Britain, he had ignited controversy by sending a series of tweets attacking the mayor of London. Moments before his flight was due to land, Mr. Trump took aim at the mayor, Sadiq Khan, calling him a “stone cold loser” in a series of posts. He then went on to compare him to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York.
....<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height.</span> In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 3,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019
Mr</span>. Trump has feuded with the mayor before. When large protests greeted the president in London during a visit last year, Mr. Khan allowed demonstrators to fly a giant orange balloon of Mr. Trump depicted as a baby in diapers. The blimp’s creator told news outlets on Sunday that the mayor had granted permission for the balloon to fly again this time round.
Days before Mr. Trump’s visit, Mr. Khan wrote an article published online on Saturday by The Observer saying: “It’s too late to stop the red-carpet treatment, but it’s not too late for the prime minister to do the right thing. Theresa May should issue a powerful rejection — not of the U.S. as a country or the office of the presidency, but of Trump and the far-right agenda he embodies.”
Mr. Trump will spend three days in Britain, first traveling to the American ambassador’s residence in London before heading on to Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. He will then attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster Abbey, have tea with Prince Charles, and attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday.
On Tuesday, he will meet with the departing prime minister, Theresa May, at her London residence and hold a joint news conference.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump will travel to the southern city of Portsmouth for a D-Day commemoration. He will then fly to Ireland on Wednesday afternoon, where he will meet with that country’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and stay overnight at the Trump International golf course in Doonbeg.
Mr. Trump arrives just as Mrs. May’s tenure as party leader is ending.
After two years of delay, friction and awkwardness, Buckingham Palace announced a date for President Trump’s state visit this past April, after Prime Minister Theresa May conveyed the queen’s invitation to Mr. Trump. He arrived in London on Monday — days before Mrs. May is to step down as leader of the Conservative Party.
When Mr. Trump did make his first visit to London as president, in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2018,</span> it had been downgraded to a working trip, without the pageantry. Mr. Trump was received by Mrs. May, Queen Elizabeth II and protesters. He criticized the prime minister’s approach to Brexit and took a weekend detour to a golf course he owns in Scotland.
This time, Mr. Trump’s penchant for uncensored opinions is likely to capture more headlines, if history is any guide. The turbulence has already started. As he did last year, before arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump spoke to The Sun tabloid and The Sunday Times — Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers — wading into the country’s political and social affairs and firing criticism at prominent officials.
Comments from Woody Johnson, the American ambassador to Britain, are likely to complicate matters. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, Mr. Johnson said that all parts of the British economy would be “on the table” in discussions over trade, including the National Health Service and agriculture.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The possibility of chlorine-washed chickens from the United States has emerged as a symbol of British concerns about a post-Brexit trade deal, but Mr. Johnson indicated that the United States would insist on access.</span> “You give the British people a choice,” he said. “If they like it, they can buy it. If they don’t want it, they don’t have to buy it.”
State visits serve as diplomatic bonanzas for the British government, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to have tea with Prince Charles, hold talks with Mrs. May and attend a banquet with the queen, among other events.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In April, Mrs. May called the visit “an opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship” on issues such as trade, investment and security.
</span>Weeks later, Mrs. May said she would resign, after nearly three years of trying but failing to shepherd Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. The contest to succeed her will begin on Friday, after she steps down as leader of the Conservative Party.
The president has been barred from speaking at Parliament.
John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has said that he would not allow Mr. Trump to address Parliament, as other leaders — including Presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, President Xi Jinping of China and former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa — have done.
<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> Mr. Bercow said Mr. Trump had “not earned” the honor of speaking to Parliament, and has so far resisted calls to let the president speak. Mr. Bercow has also declined an invitation to the banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday night, a spokeswoman for his office said.
The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, also declined an invitation to the state dinner. Unlike Mr. Bercow, he elaborated on his decision in a statement in April.
“Theresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric,” Mr. Corbyn said. “Maintaining an important relationship with the United States does not require the pomp and ceremony of a state visit.”
In The Sun interview, the president said he thought that the Labour leader was making a mistake. “I think he would want to get along with the United States” if he were to become Britain’s leader, Mr. Trump said.
He will meet the queen for the second time.
The world’s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 93,</span> has <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">met 12 American</span> presidents, starting with President Harry S. Truman when she was a princess and heir to the throne. Last year, she sat for tea with Mr. Trump — who with the first lady, Melania Trump, appeared not to follow long-running protocol in which a bow or curtsy is customary.
One awkward moment, in particular, caught the eye of social media users: While they inspected her honor guard, the queen gestured to Mr. Trump and appeared to direct him forward. But he walked in front of her and then stopped, cutting off her path and forcing her to sidestep around him.
This year, Mr. Trump is scheduled to take tea with Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Harry is expected to join them for a private lunch with Mr. Trump, according to the BBC, and Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, will attend the state banquet on Monday evening.
The BBC also reported that Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex — who is on maternity leave after giving birth to the couple’s first child last month — would not be attending the dinner.
In The Sun interview, when the president was told that <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 the</span> former actress, an American, threatened to move to Canada if he were elected president, Mr. Trump said, “I didn’t know she was nasty.” Still, he said he thought it was nice to have an American princess, adding, “I am sure she will do excellently.”
Mr. Trump may meet with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.
Mrs. May’s rivals have already begun angling to succeed her, and the field is crowded.
The apparent front-runner is Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister and supporter of Brexit. Mr. Trump has voiced his support for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc — calling himself Mr. Brexit — and last year, he both second-guessed Mrs. May’s handling of it and said that Mr. Johnson “would be a great prime minister.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">In the recent interviews with the British news outlets, Mr. Trump again said that the former foreign minister would do a very good job, but added that his words did not amount to an endorsement.
</span>“Well, I like him, I’ve always liked him,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know that he is going to be chosen, but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person.” He added, “He has been very positive about me and our country.” (Mr. Johnson was born in the United States but renounced his American citizenship <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span>)
He also criticized Britain’s negotiating strategy. “I think that the U.K. allowed the European Union to have all cards,” he said. “And it is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage.”
It is unclear whether the praise will reap benefits for Mr. Johnson, given Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in Britain. Conservative lawmakers are expected to whittle the candidates to two. Then the finalists will compete for the votes of party activists.
Mr. Trump also said he might meet with Mr. Farage and Mr. Johnson this week.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">While Mr. Trump has had a sometimes strained relationship with Mrs. May, especially over Brexit and the possibility of a trade deal, he has found a more closely aligned ally in Mr. Farage, whose nationalist and populist Brexit Party did well in last month’s European Parliament elections.
</span>“Nigel Farage is a friend of mine, Boris is a friend of mine, they’re two very good guys, very interesting people,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday.

41923,"<h3>Trump signs $15 billion Harvey aid package after Republicans booed top White House officials</h3>President Trump signed a bill Friday to <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">deliver $15 billion</span> in disaster aid and also extend government funding and the federal borrowing limit until Dec.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> despite objections of Republican lawmakers who booed two top White House officials earlier in the day over the deal Trump struck with Democrats.
The measure passed a morning House <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">vote 316 to</span> 90; every member opposed was a Republican.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Yet even the House Republicans who supported the bill were frustrated that Trump bargained with Democrats on Wednesday for a short-limit debt increase, undercutting GOP congressional leaders and setting up a messy end-of-year negotiation.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That frustration was taken out Friday morning on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who came to Capitol Hill to urge skeptical Republican lawmakers to back the measure.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">To many GOP members, the administration’s messengers were poorly chosen: Mnuchin is a New York financier known for his past as a Democratic fundraiser.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mulvaney is a former House conservative who spent much of his legislative career browbeating GOP leaders over the national debt and budget deficits.
</span>“There were probably a lot of members in there in disbelief,” Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said. “I do know that there is a lot of frustration with the deal that was cut by the president, and I think it’s a very difficult pill for many in there to swallow.”
At several points, according to several members and aides, comments from Mnuchin and Mulvaney were met with groans, boos and hisses.
Mnuchin, in particular, drew jeers after asking Republicans to support the measure for him personally rather than for the policy, then leaving the meeting early by explaining he had other pressing matters to attend to.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">“His last words, and I quote, was, ‘Vote for the debt ceiling for me,’ ” said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), who leads a group of conservative members.</span> “That did not go over well in the room at all … His performance was incredibly poor.”
Mnuchin’s closing went so poorly, Walker said, that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reminded members afterward that hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims were counting on their votes.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">At another point, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) pressed Mulvaney on whether the Trump administration would commit to seeking reductions in the federal budget deficit as a part of negotiations with Democrats ahead of the new Dec.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 deadline</span>.
</span>Mulvaney said he could not make that commitment, and members booed.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The debt ceiling is supposed to be at least a stop sign that gives us pause and gives us a chance to change the way we’re doing our spending, and it’s not even a yield sign,” Barton said afterward.</span> “In fact, it’s an increase speed sign right now.”
Democrats were expected to deliver a majority of the votes to approve the deal, making it easier for Republicans to vote against the package without the threat of failing to provide critical disaster funding as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida’s southern coast.
Republican leaders avoided an embarrassing benchmark by persuading a solid majority of GOP members to support the deal.
But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the scale of the Republican revolt on Friday was still “remarkable.”
“If I ever as leader or as speaker <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 90 members</span> vote against one of the easiest bills to vote for, which is disaster assistance, you know they have a philosophical problem with governance,” she said.
The legislation easily passed the Senate by a vote <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 80 to</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17 on</span> Thursday, despite similar concerns from Senate conservatives.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was among those Republicans who initially opposed the idea of a three-month extension of the federal borrowing limit, but he said Thursday he supports the legislation. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Ryan said he worries about the impact of continued reliance on short-term debt limit fixes on credit markets but that the package Trump agreed to is intended to create certainty while the United States responds to a number of natural disasters.
</span>“We need to make sure that the government responds to people,” Ryan told reporters at a weekly news conference. “So the president wanted to make sure that we are — are going together as Republicans and Democrats to respond to this.”
[Republicans jolted by, and Democrats wary of, Trump’s overtures to opposing party]
While the passage of the bill Friday defuses the most explosive items on the September calendar, Congress has not cleared all of the obstacles ahead. It still must reauthorize several programs and agencies before the end of the month, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Democrats have indicated they might use those deadlines to press for action to protect those at risk of deportation because of Trump’s cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as well as payments to health insurers mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Those fights, however, would not result in a government shutdown or federal default. That risk now shifts to December, setting up months of high-stakes bargaining that will determine whether Trump will be able to fulfill promises of increasing military spending and building at least a portion of a Mexican border wall. Also likely to become part of the negotiation is another chunk of federal funding for disaster victims — a tally that could increase dramatically with Hurricane Irma.
Among those most frustrated by Trump’s deal with Democrats were Texas conservatives who represent the area affected by Hurricane Harvey.
Texas lawmakers met Thursday for a bipartisan lunch during which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) called in and urged them to support the federal aid bill.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Many conservatives left the lunch saying they expected to take their first-ever vote in favor of a debt-ceiling hike to advance Harvey aid.
</span>Most of the state’s delegation supported the bill, but four Texas Republicans voted against it: Barton, as well as Reps. Sam Johnson, Jeb Hensarling and Mac Thornberry. The latter two men both chair major committees.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“I love President Trump, and I’m with him <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">probably 90 or</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 95 percent</span> of the time, but I don’t think it’s appropriate to raise the debt ceiling <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $19 trillion</span> public debt and not have any effort to change the way we spend money here in Washington,” Barton said Thursday.
</span>Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.), who represents a Central Texas district largely spared by Harvey, voted for the bill but wondered about its consequences Thursday.
“I just hope the president isn’t hurt by the long-term impact of this deal,” Flores said. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“You think about a Dec.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8 debt</span>-ceiling deadline: The Democrats are going to play that for all it’s worth in terms of a government shutdown and trying to cut a deal that may have all of their pet projects in it, and that may be something the president doesn’t find to be beneficial.”
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">[Debt-ceiling shift signifies a remarkable political evolution for Trump]
</span>But others saw Trump’s deal as a wake-up call to Republicans.
“I think he sent a crystal-clear message that if we don’t get things accomplished, he’s going to find other ways to move the ball,” Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) said. “That should ratchet up pressure on the House and the Senate.”
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">On Friday morning, it was Mulvaney — a firebrand co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group that has railed against increasing the debt limit — who absorbed much of the House GOP’s frustration.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) rose to ask Mulvaney whether he <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">had 42 openings</span> for deputy directors at the Office of Management and Budget.</span> A bewildered Mulvaney replied he had only one vacancy.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Issa replied that was unfortunate, because he could hire his former Freedom Caucus colleagues so they could reverse their positions on raising the debt limit just like Mulvaney had — a response that prompted a roar in the room and caused Mulvaney, in several members’ telling, to turn red.
</span>Afterward, Mulvaney’s former colleagues defended him — to a point. “It’s ironic, but it’s not hypocritical, because he works for somebody now,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said. “But it’s ironic — it’s really, really, really ironic.”"
36631,"<h3>What to Know About Trump’s TikTok-WeChat App Store Ban: Live Updates</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">What to Know About Trump’s TikTok-WeChat App Store Ban: Live Updates
The latest economic and business news during the coronavirus pandemic.
</span>The Trump administration said Friday it will block WeChat and TikTok from app stores in the United States. The ban will take effect on Sunday and means WeChat users in the country won’t be able to use it to transfer funds or make payments.
Both apps, which are used by more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 million</span> people in the United States, are owned by Chinese companies. The Trump administration has argued that they collect data that could be accessed by the Chinese government.
The ban comes as TikTok is negotiating a deal that would make Oracle a technology partner while taking an ownership stake in the app. The deal is meant to address the Trump administration’s concerns about China’s access to user data on the app.
The New York Times has been covering developments between the White House and the two apps. You can read more about what’s been going on here:
China’s Powerhouse App Is WeChat, and Its Power Is Sweeping
For most Chinese people in China, WeChat is a sort of all-in-one app: a way to swap stories, talk to old classmates, pay bills, coordinate with co-workers, post envy-inducing vacation photos, buy stuff and get news. For the millions of members of China’s diaspora, it is the bridge that links them to the trappings of home, from family chatter to food photos.
Woven through it all is the ever more muscular surveillance and propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party. As WeChat has become ubiquitous, it has become a powerful tool of social control, a way for Chinese authorities to guide and police what people say, whom they talk to and what they read.
It has even extended Beijing’s reach beyond its borders. When secret police issue threats abroad, they often do so on WeChat. When military researchers working undercover in the United States needed to talk to China’s embassies, they used WeChat, according to court documents. The party coordinates via WeChat with members studying overseas.
Targeting WeChat, Trump Takes Aim at China’s Bridge to the World
Outside China, WeChat has mainly been a tether for the Chinese diaspora to their homeland.
May Han, a Chinese-born American, moved to the United States with her family when she <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 9.</span> Lonely when she first arrived, Ms. Han was encouraged by her parents to use another Tencent chat service, QQ, to keep up with her elementary school friends in China. They also hoped it would help her remember Chinese.
Eventually she made the jump to WeChat, where she still whiles away her online days chatting with <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 350 friends</span> and relatives, many of them in China. Now an environmental science major at the University of California, San Diego, Ms. Han said WeChat had become the cultural glue that held together much of her Chinese community.
“If we can’t use WeChat, our connections to China will decrease or even vanish,” she said. “Most of us have got used to using WeChat, especially older generations. Changing an app is not easy for them; it means changing their lifestyle.”
Trump’s Attacks on TikTok and WeChat Could Further Fracture the Internet
China and the United States have different starting points when it comes to governing high-tech industries. The Communist Party has no tolerance for its citizens speaking out against it online or organizing outside its sphere of control. It has also made no secret of its ambitions to cultivate Chinese companies’ expertise in advanced technologies, which foreign competitors say sometimes leads the authorities to give local firms unfair advantages.

The Federal Reserve unveiled a major update to its policy statement this week, indicating that it will leave interest rates on hold near zero until the economy has regained full employment, inflation has risen <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2 percent</span></span>, and those price gains look to be headed even higher.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">While that guidance lays the groundwork for years of growth-stoking monetary policy, Neel Kashkari from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis wanted to do even more and was one of two votes against the statement.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">He would have pledged to keep rates low until core inflation — which strips out volatile fuel and food — had <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeded 2 percent</span> on a sustained basis.
</span>“I would have preferred the Committee make a stronger commitment to not raising rates until we were certain to have achieved our dual mandate objectives,” Mr. Kashkari wrote in an explanation of his dissent published Friday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed’s new guidance, had it been in place following the Great Recession, would only have slightly delayed the central bank’s timing on rate increases, he said.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Inflation did briefly rise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2 percent</span></span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span></span></span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He argued that the revamped language should not include a reference to full employment, which is nearly impossible to gauge in real time.
</span>Mr. Kashkari’s colleague, Robert S. Kaplan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, joined him in dissenting. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But Mr. Kaplan did so for a very different reason: He wanted the central bank to retain more flexibility, rather than indicating that actual achievement <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2 percent</span> inflation was a necessary condition for raising rates.</span> That would create leeway to raise rates earlier.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The statement revamp came after the Fed reworked its long-run policy goals last month, making changes that would embrace periods of faster inflation and which enshrined modesty when it came to judging labor market hotness.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">“They’re sort of on two sides of the discussion,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s Chair, said of the dissents at his post-meeting news conference.</span> “We’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework. There’s no cookbook.”

</span>The pandemic has had devastating consequences for a wide variety of occupations, but housekeepers have been among the hardest hit.
Seventy-two percent of them reported that they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Domestic Workers Alliance. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The fortunate had employers who continued to pay them.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The unlucky called or texted their employers and heard nothing back.</span> They weren’t laid off so much as ghosted, en masse.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">The pandemic has laid bare not just the vulnerability of housekeepers to economic shocks but their total lack of leverage.</span> Several workers said they had clients who would not let anyone clean who has had Covid-19; others know clients who will hire only Covid survivors, on the theory that after their recovery, they pose no health risk.

CaixaBank and Bankia agreed late Thursday to merge in a deal that would form Spain’s largest bank and end the government’s majority control over Bankia, the institution that was at the heart of Spain’s financial crisis <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2012 banking</span> bailout.
</span>The all-share agreement was presented as a merger, but CaixaBank, which is based in Barcelona, will account for about two-thirds of the new bank’s combined assets, <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth 665 billion</span> euros, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or $785 billion</span>. The combined institution, with an <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">expected 20 million</span> customers, will keep the CaixaBank name.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The transaction comes after both banks have reported sharp drops in first-half earnings, at a time of record-low interest rates and as the coronavirus pandemic has plunged Spain into one of the deepest recessions in Europe.
</span>Many analysts expect the continued pressure on banks’ margins to force further consolidation in the sector. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">A merger between CaixaBank and Bankia “could revive moves by other banks to gain scale or strengthen their franchises or business models to remain competitive,” Fitch Ratings said in a note to investors earlier this month.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Bankia was formed as a seven-way merger intended to consolidate savings banks, known as cajas in Spain, which were crippled by bad loans, a result of the bursting of the country’s construction bubble after the onset of the world financial crisis <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2008.</span>
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But instead of shoring up Spain’s financial sector, Bankia ended up posting the largest banking loss in the country’s history and requiring about €22 billion in rescue funding, as part of a European banking bailout that the Spanish government was forced to negotiate <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012.</span></span> As a result, the government also took over Bankia, which was then slimmed down to return it to profit.

12016,"<h3>No one expected a Stephen Strasburg extension. Then Scott Boras made a call.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">It had become a ritual for the Strasburgs of San Diego, an annual opportunity for a young family to sort out business, to assess the past year and look toward the future.</span> Stephen and Rachel, parents to 2-year-old Raegan, would meet for dinner at King’s Fish House with his agent, Scott Boras, in mid-February, before heading to Viera, Fla., and spring training with the Washington Nationals.
Boras and Scott Chiamparino, a top lieutenant, had driven from his Newport Beach offices. They chose King’s for mutual convenience — a 10-minute drive from the Strasburgs’ north San Diego offseason home, just off <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 405 for</span> Boras — and the food. They devoured plates of popcorn shrimp, crab Louie salad, clam chowder, fried fish and, for the health-conscious Strasburg, grilled salmon. Typically, they would use the meeting to discuss the specifics of Strasburg’s arbitration deal. This time, both Boras and Strasburg entered the meal with grander ideas.
Boras already had engaged in preliminary conversations with top Nationals officials, in both the front office and ownership, regarding signing Strasburg to a long-term contract extension. Strasburg, too, had spent the winter pondering the possibility, weighing his contentment in a city far away from the West Coast of his childhood that had slowly and unexpectedly come to feel like home. Free agency beckoned, but he felt the pull of comfort and familiarity. He wanted, he told Boras over fish and cocktail sauce, to stay in Washington.
When Boras left King’s, walking back to his car under the Southern California moonlight, he believed absolutely something no one else in the baseball world saw coming, even months later, until the news broke Monday night as Strasburg pitched at Nationals Park: Strasburg and the Nationals, he thought, would reach a long-term agreement to extend his contract. He phoned Ted Lerner, the Nationals’ managing principal owner.
“I think we have an opportunity to put this thing together,” Boras told him.
The following account, based on interviews with people directly and indirectly involved on both sides of the negotiations, describes how Strasburg, a former No.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 overall</span> pick as one of the most heralded young pitchers in a generation, and the Nationals agreed on a complex, seven-year extension <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $175 million</span></span>. The dealings offer a window into the often fruitful and uncommonly close relationship between Lerner and Boras, a show of Strasburg’s affinity for Washington and a potential road map for future negotiations over a contract extension for Bryce Harper, Washington’s other No.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1 pick</span> and franchise pillar represented by Boras.
The discussions started Jan.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span> a busy day across baseball, the deadline to exchange contract figures for teams and players for salary arbitration. “Frantic Friday, man,” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said. As Rizzo and Boras negotiated one-year deals for some of Boras’s Nationals clients — Danny Espinosa, Anthony Rendon and Strasburg himself — Rizzo broached Strasburg’s future.
Although Strasburg, a natural introvert, had been slow to adjust to public life, Rizzo had seen subtle changes. In recent years, his interactions in Washington gave Rizzo a sense he had grown comfortable in the city. Even though Strasburg had just one season remaining before free agency, a stage at which almost all players choose to have <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 30 teams</span> bid on them, Rizzo believed Strasburg might be interested in a long-term deal.
The suggestion didn’t surprise Boras. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The seed had been planted back in November, when Boras and Lerner met at the owners meetings in Boca Raton, Fla. Lerner, the 90-year-old Washington native who became one of America’s wealthiest men through a real estate business he began with a loan from his wife, Annette, outlines his offseason vision at their annual discussion.</span> Boras, the 63-year-old former Class AA infielder who became one of baseball’s most powerful figures, pitches Lerner on available clients.
“They have an incredible relationship,” said Mark Lerner, a Nationals principal owner and Ted’s son. “Scott really respects my dad and what he’s built over the years from nothing. They enjoy the banter back and forth. It’s an interesting relationship. They know how to get things done.”
[How the Strasburg deal may affect Bryce Harper’s future]
Boras explained how Baltimore Orioles slugger Chris Davis would fit into Washington’s lineup, hitting behind Harper. Lerner countered by saying he did not want an exorbitant contract like Davis’s tying up long-term payroll that would hinder signing Strasburg or Harper, who is scheduled to become a free agent after <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2018 season</span>. Boras made a mental note about Lerner’s desire to lock up Strasburg. Both men knew they would be in touch over the winter.
On the day of the arbitration deadline, the idea resurfaced. After Rizzo and Boras talked, Rizzo informed Lerner he should contact Boras. Lerner called Boras and invited him to his Palm Springs, Calif., home. “Come look at some art,” Lerner told him.
More than the public realized, Lerner viewed Strasburg with great affection. Strasburg in his eyes represented the growth of his franchise, a first overall pick who had validated the Nationals when he signed out of San Diego State, a foundational superstar who brought national attention with his sensational debut at Nationals Park <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span>
Third baseman Ryan Zimmerman was a National when the Lerner family bought the team, so Strasburg was the Lerners’ first great player and biggest splash. More than that, Lerner admired how Strasburg and Rachel lived quiet and humble lives, unchanged by his stature. He liked them personally and appreciated what Strasburg meant to his team.
In early February, Boras drove the two hours from his Newport Beach office to Palm Desert, the town next to Palm Springs. He met Lerner and Annette at Wolfgang Puck’s WP Kitchen + Bar. Over grilled shrimp and pasta, Annette chatted up Boras about art. Ted talked about baseball philosophy and a common perception: that Boras refuses to sign contract extensions, determined instead to take players to free agency. Boras insisted otherwise.
“No, I work for players,” he told Lerner. “It’s up to them what they want to do.” Boras told the Lerners he would speak with Strasburg about an extension. The dinner at King’s Fish House several days later would be the setting.
The security of a deal, Boras told Strasburg that evening, would lead to happiness and relaxed performance. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He laid out the business model of what an extension would look like, telling Strasburg he could expect seven years, with an opt-out clause that would allow him to reenter the free agent market.
</span>Over the winter, Strasburg had asked himself a simple question: “Why do I play?” He determined he wanted to win and to enjoy teammates. Both, he believed, could be accomplished with the Nationals. Strasburg also appreciated how the Nationals took care of his body. The team’s unprecedented decision to shut down Strasburg in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2012,</span> in the middle of their first playoff run, following his recovery from arm surgery bothered the right-hander then. But as time passed, Strasburg came to peace with the reasoning.
The baseball world thought Strasburg wanted to bolt for his home state in free agency. Even close friends admitted this week that they figured Strasburg would end up in California. The assumptions were wrong, misguided speculation about a cypher. He expressed to Boras a desire to stay.
With Strasburg’s blessing, Boras could begin full negotiations. With the Nationals, that meant a kind of triangular discussion. Over the years, as Boras clients Jayson Werth, Rafael Soriano and Max Scherzer signed high-profile free agent deals, the Nationals had developed an unofficial system for dealing with Boras. Rizzo and Lerner would talk about baseball markets and contractual guidelines. Boras would meet in person with Lerner. Lerner and Rizzo would debrief.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">[Max Scherzer’s bravura 20-strikeout performance]
So when Lerner told Rizzo he wanted to offer Strasburg a five-year extension <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $100 million</span>, Rizzo had to let him down easy — that just wasn’t market value.
</span>Days later, Boras was driving up Frank Sinatra Drive to Tamarisk Country Club, where the Lerners had long been members, a course not far from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 9,500</span>-square foot, six-bedroom Palm Springs home. Boras had met Ted and Annette at the club often enough to know how lunch would go: No matter how much he resisted or explained that he doesn’t eat bread, they would make him try Tamarisk’s renowned cheese bread. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">They chatted about golf and business philosophy and competition.
</span>They retreated to the Lerners’ home, where Boras had negotiated many deals and taken many meetings. As per their custom, Annette showed Boras one piece from her self-curated collection — a sculpture, on this day — and explained its history and how she had acquired it at auction. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 4 p</span>.m., the Lerners’ in-home chef prepared coffee and crispy cinnamon cookies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The meetings had grown to always be a mix of business and friendship.
</span>“It’s book-worthy,” Boras said. “The rare thing in life is that — who gets to talk to someone who is in gym class when Pearl Harbor is bombed and what Roosevelt said and his gym coach is Red Auerbach? Seriously. Ted’s amazing because you sit and you talk to him and you’re going through things for an hour, and then you <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get 15 minutes</span> of things you’ve never heard anybody say in your life.”
For two hours, Boras showed Lerner binders of information about Strasburg’s potential, the needs of opposing teams and revenues across the sport. Lerner wanted to compare Strasburg’s potential deal to those free agent deals signed by former National Jordan Zimmermann with the Detroit Tigers (five years,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $110 million</span> ) and Johnny Cueto with the San Francisco Giants (six years,<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $130 million</span> ). Those pitchers, Lerner reasoned, had accomplished more than Strasburg, who had yet to win more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 15 games</span> in a season and who had tossed more <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 200 innings</span> just once.
Boras showed him the recent contracts of the game’s best pitchers — Clayton Kershaw, Scherzer, Zack Greinke, all Cy Young winners — and told him to think more along those lines. Boras agreed that Strasburg could not match their accomplishments, and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2010 Tommy</span> John surgery added another risk. But Boras laid out a case for why Strasburg fit between the groups: If his potential filled in, he would accomplish all that those pitchers had and maybe more. He sold Strasburg to Lerner, really, on spec.
Behind the scenes, the Nationals’ front office treated Strasburg’s extension like an arbitration case, looking up comparable players and contracts. It had reached a conclusion similar to Boras’s, settling on pitchers Justin Verlander with the Detroit Tigers (seven years,<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $180 million</span> ) and Felix Hernandez with the Seattle Mariners (seven years,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $175 million</span> ) as models. Even though those two had accomplished more than Strasburg, revenues had increased across the sport since they signed their deals.
The key to the negotiation for Boras was to create a contract that could provide Strasburg with long-term comfort but also keep alive the chance to enter free agency after he had accomplished more. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He envisioned Strasburg,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 27,</span> having a minimum of <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $220 million</span> guaranteed in his entire career, plus the chance to hit the market <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 30 or</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31 </span>— as Scherzer and Greinke had done — with a baseline salary somewhere <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $25 million</span>.</span> He proposed a “rolling” opt-out clause that would allow Strasburg to break a contract after three or four seasons.
Boras made three more trips to Palm Springs over the next two months, all the same routine — art and crispy cinnamon treats and hammering out the details of Strasburg’s contract. Lerner wanted money deferred to years after the contract’s conclusion, a common arrangement between the sides on prior deals. Boras would accept deferrals in exchange for performance bonuses —<span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1 million</span> for every season in which Strasburg <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reaches 180 innings</span> pitched — and <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10 million</span> signing bonus to offset the lesser present-day value. Lerner agreed.
“It’s a pretty fascinating process when the two of them go at it,” Mark Lerner said. “My dad, he’s always loved to negotiate, and that’s a classic thing for Scott.”
Lerner and Boras had done enough contracts that those seeming intricacies came together quickly; they even used Scherzer’s contract as a blueprint for how Strasburg would be paid the deferred money. Lerner had made a fortune on far more complex real estate contracts.
The hardest part was haggling over the average annual value and total years. Back in February at King’s, Boras had told Strasburg he could expect seven years. He would not settle for less, even though Lerner had a hard time agreeing to even six.
During the last week of April, with the Miami Marlins in Los Angeles to play the Dodgers, Boras was eating lunch with client Jose Fernandez, the Marlins’ young pitching ace. He saw a call on his phone from Lerner’s number. He excused himself and listened.
Lerner agreed to a seventh year. They had a deal.
Strasburg received a text message from Boras asking him to call. When Boras gave him the news, Strasburg was elated. He called his family for their final thoughts before telling Boras “yes,” to proceed.
Finishing touches still remained. Strasburg would have to take a physical. Because the Nationals had never given a player an opt-out clause, it took their legal team a week to write and review the language. Meanwhile, the Nationals’ season rolled on.
Strasburg pitched for two weeks with the cloud of the near-finalized contract looming over his head. He told Boras early in the process to leave him out to avoid distractions. But Boras had to involve him in the latter stages.
“It’s hard to block something like this out because it’s your future and your kids’ kids’ future, too,” Strasburg said. “The bottom line is I play this game because I’m a competitor, I love the guy next to me and I want to do everything I can to help this team win.”
Boras’s stomach was in knots as he watched Strasburg make two starts before the contract was done. Any pitch could pop a ligament or a false step blow out a knee and could spell doom for the deal. The potential for cruel fate is why Boras doesn’t like to work out contracts midseason.
Baseball is a small world, so even a whiff of a potential extension could spread. But the Nationals, Boras and Strasburg kept quiet. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Well-connected team employees and most of Strasburg’s teammates didn’t know.
</span>“A couple guys knew,” Strasburg said. “But ones that did know knew to kind of keep it hush-hush. Some guys asked me how I was doing when I left [for my physical], and I said, ‘Nothing serious.’ They didn’t really pry after that.”
The Nationals were concerned questions would arise <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 30,</span> the second day of a three-game series in St. Louis. Strasburg had started the game the night before, striking out nine Cardinals and allowing two runs over seven innings in the 5-4 Nationals win.
“They say Washington is a town of secrets,” Boras said. “I now believe that it is. I was amazed. I told Rizz, ‘There’s no chance we keep this thing quiet for seven or eight days.’ ”
A first-class ticket in hand that Saturday morning, Strasburg boarded the first flight from St. Louis to Reagan National Airport. Team physician Robin West, an orthopedic surgeon at Inova Fairfax Hospital, spearheaded Strasburg’s physical. Among other tests, Strasburg spent two hours in an MRI machine. “Pretty much an all-day affair,” he said.
The Nationals are wary of the life span of a second elbow but believed in Strasburg’s health. Despite <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 elbow</span> reconstruction <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 2013 bone</span> chip removal, the Nationals were pleased with Strasburg’s clean test results.
Strasburg could have been spotted in Washington while the team was in St. Louis, but his presence remained unreported, and he never worried about it, anyway. He left on the last flight from Reagan National the same day of the physical. Exhausted, he rejoined the rest of the team at the Westin St. Louis and went straight to sleep. He awoke Sunday and headed to Busch Stadium, happy he could throw his bullpen session as scheduled.
Strasburg signed the letter of agreement a week later. Word of the extension first came out during the third inning of Strasburg’s start Monday, delivered in a tweet by The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes at 8:06 p.m. Boras was at the game but unseen by reporters. After Strasburg was pulled in the eighth inning, he heard a fan above the Nationals’ dugout say congratulations. “The light bulb went off,” he said.
On Tuesday afternoon, Strasburg formally signed the contract in the executive offices on the second floor of Nationals Park. It reminded him of the day seven years ago when he had signed the draft contract that made him a professional baseball player. He had, in those seven years, become a star, a lightning rod for controversy, a father, a dominant big league pitcher, a man.
And now, as his pen met paper, he would stay a Washington National.

63851,"<h3>Chinese Textile Mills Are Now Hiring in Places Where Cotton Was King</h3>INDIAN LAND, S.C. — Twenty-five years ago, Ni Meijuan <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earned $19 a</span> month working the spinning machines at a vast textile factory in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Now at the Keer Group’s cotton mill in South Carolina, which opened in April, Ms. Ni is training American workers to do the job she used to do.
</span>“They’re quick learners,” Ms. Ni said after showing two fresh recruits how to tease errant wisps of cotton from the machines’ grinding gears. “But they have to learn to be quicker.”
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Once the epitome of cheap mass manufacturing, textile producers from formerly low-cost nations are starting to set up shop in America.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It is part of a blurring of once seemingly clear-cut boundaries between high- and low-cost manufacturing nations that few would have predicted a decade ago.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Textile production in China is becoming increasingly unprofitable after years of rising wages, higher energy bills and mounting logistical costs, as well as new government quotas on the import of cotton.
</span>At the same time, manufacturing costs in the United States are becoming more competitive. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">In Lancaster County, where Indian Land is located, Keer has found residents desperate for work, even at depressed wages, as well as access to cheap and abundant land and energy and heavily subsidized cotton.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Politicians, from the county to the state to the federal government, have raced to ply Keer with grants and tax breaks to bring back manufacturing jobs once thought to be lost forever.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The prospect of a sweeping Pacific trade agreement that is led by the United States, and excludes China, is also driving Chinese yarn companies to gain a foothold here, lest they be shut out of the lucrative American market.
</span>Keer’<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $218 million</span> mill spins yarn from raw cotton to sell to textile makers across Asia. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">While Keer still spins much of its yarn in China, importing the raw cotton from America, that is slowly changing.
</span>“The reasons for Keer coming here? Incentives, land, the environment, the workers,” Zhu Shanqing, Keer’s chairman, said on a recent trip to the United States.
“In China, the whole yarn manufacturing industry is losing money,” he added. “In America, it’s very different.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Since Beijing and Washington resumed trade relations in the early 1970s, the United States has mostly run a huge trade deficit, as Americans consumed billions of dollars in cheap electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But surging labor and energy costs in China are eroding its competitiveness in manufacturing.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">According to the Boston Consulting Group, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have almost tripled in China over the last decade, to an <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $12.47 an</span> hour last year <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $4.35 an</span> hour <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004.</span>
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 percent</span> <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2004,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $22.32 an</span> hour, according to the consulting firm.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies.
</span>Today, for <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">every $1 required</span> to manufacture in the United States, Boston Consulting estimates that it <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs 96 cents</span> to manufacture in China. Yarn production costs in China are <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now 30 percent</span> higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.
“Everybody believed that China would always be cheaper,” said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. “But things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.”
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">Rising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.</span> In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.
In recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">From 2000 to</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014,</span> Chinese companies <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invested $46 billion</span> on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.
The Carolinas are now home to at <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 20 Chinese</span> manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“I never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,” said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20 million</span>, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The inner workings of Keer’s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.
</span>Inside <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 230,000</span>-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.
The work is highly automated, with the factory’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 32 production</span> lines churning out <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 85 tons</span> of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 500 workers</span>, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries — a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.
The spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts — as long as the yarn is made in a member country.
</span>Sheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">“Common sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,” he said.</span> “Now some of that is reversed.”
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">But cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that “it’s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.”
</span>Investment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $70 million</span> factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area’s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 that</span> it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.
“The whole textile world is looking at us,” Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory’s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.
For residents of South Carolina, Keer’s arrival could not have come soon enough. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world’s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The global economic crisis hit soon afterward.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">By <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2009,</span> Lancaster County’s unemployment rate had <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 18.6 percent</span>.
</span>“They shut them down one by one,” said Donnie R. Gordon, who <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent 17 years</span> weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“You could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.”
</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">But shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases.</span> Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.
“I think I’m going to like it here,” said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni’s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer’s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.
Keer’s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">The outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer’s American prospects.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.
</span>Then there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 Chinese</span> trainers at Keer’s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers’ occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.
Robbie Sowers, a 32-year textile industry veteran who maintains the plant’s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes’ leeway before calling them late.
“There’s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.”
As she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 100,</span> how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators. The screens flashed:<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 76,</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 85,</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 90.</span> Experienced workers in China rarely let that number drop <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 97,</span> she said.
“They’re learning,” she said. “I have to be patient.”"
1787,"<h3>Sex Offender Registries Don't Keep Kids Safe, But Politicians Keep Expanding Them Anyway</h3>The first time Damian Winters got evicted was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> He was living with his wife and two sons in suburban Nashville when his probation officer called his landlord and informed him that Winters was a registered sex offender.
The previous year, when he <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 24 years</span> old, Winters had been arrested for downloading a three-minute porn clip. The file description said the girl in the video was 16; the prosecutor said she <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 14.</span> He was charged with attempted sexual exploitation of a minor and, because he had used file-sharing software to download the video, attempted distribution of child pornography.
Winters had no criminal record, no history of contact with children and no other illegal files on his computer. Facing an eight-year prison sentence, he had taken a plea deal that gave him six years’ probation <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 15 years</span> on Tennessee’s sex offender registry.
The day after his landlord found all this out, Winters found a letter on his porch giving him and his <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">family 72 hours</span> to move out. He ended up in one homeless shelter, his wife and sons in another.
He had no idea that it would be the last time he would ever live in a home. He has been sleeping in shelters, halfway houses and parked cars ever since.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“I’ve lost everything so many times,” said Winters, who asked HuffPost not to use his real name due to concerns that it would add to the difficulty of finding housing and employment.
</span>His years on the registry have been an exercise in hitting rock bottom and then falling even further down. He has attempted suicide twice and checked himself into inpatient psychiatric facilities three times. The strain of living apart from his family eventually ended his marriage. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Without an income to help keep his family afloat, his now-ex-wife had no choice but to take the kids and move back in with her parents in Ohio.</span> Winters can’t visit without approval from his probation officer and can’t afford the bus fare very often anyway, so he only sees his sons a few times per year. <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 29,</span> he still <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">h<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10 years</span></span> left before his name comes off the registry.
“I don’t even forge relationships anymore,” Winters said. “People are judgmental, so I keep to myself. I go to work, I go to sleep and I try not to think about what’s going to take everything away the next time.”
Winters is a member of an expanding and invisible American underclass. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1994,</span> when Congress passed the first sex offender registration law, the list was reserved for law enforcement officials and only applied to the most serious offenders. Since then, American lawmakers at every level have relentlessly increased its scope and severity.
The registry now includes more <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 900,000 people</span>, a population slightly greater than Vermont’s. At <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 states</span> require sex offender registration for public urination; five apply it to people charged with offenses related to sex work;<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29 require</span> it for consensual sex between teenagers. According to Human Rights Watch, people have been forced to spend decades on the registry for crimes they committed as young <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10 years</span> old.
“When we first started talking about registering sex offenders it seemed like a good idea,” said Jill Levenson, a Barry University researcher and social worker who has published more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 articles</span> about sexual abuse. “But now the net has widened. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They’re for life, there’s no mechanism to come off and there’s more restrictions on employment, housing and travel.”
</span>The conditions imposed on registered sex offenders have become significantly more draconian over time. More <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 states</span> now require registrants to live at <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 1,000 feet</span> away from schools, churches and other places children congregate — a requirement that renders up <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 99% of</span> homes and apartment buildings off-limits. Some states require registered offenders to submit to regular polygraph tests and random police inspections. Florida adds “sexual predator” to the front of registrants’ driver’s licenses. Louisiana doesn’t allow sex offenders to evacuate from their own homes before natural disasters.
What explains these relentlessly tightening restrictions, Levenson said, is the domino effect that happens every time a city or state strengthens their registration laws. Politicians in neighboring jurisdictions, fearing an influx of offenders, feel they have no choice but to tighten their own. In April, Tennessee passed a new law restricting sex offenders from being alone with their own children, a direct response to a similar provision in Alabama.
Despite child sexual abuse declining <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 60% between</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1992 and</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010,</span> states continue to legislate as if lenient sex offender laws are a national emergency. And, like so many other corners of the criminal justice system, the crackdown hasn’t affected all Americans equally. State registries are disproportionately black and overwhelmingly poor. As demonstrated by the recent case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire long accused of molesting underage girls, local prosecutors and judges have wide discretion to overlook wealthy offenders while imposing impossible restrictions on poorer ones.
Sex offender registries continue to enjoy enthusiastic bipartisan support and meager media scrutiny despite any evidence that they achieve their stated goals.
“These laws are passed with good intentions,” Levenson said, “but they’re based on myths about sex offenses and they don’t keep people from reoffending. Community safety is important, but we need evidence-based policies that allow offenders to reintegrate into society. All we’re doing now is putting people in a position where they have nothing to lose.”
Sex offender registries are based on faulty assumptions and debunked myths.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While the criteria for sex offender registries vary widely between states, they are all based on the same two false assumptions: that sex offenders are uniquely likely to reoffend, and that notifying their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status will make that outcome less likely.
</span>The first assumption is based on the “stranger danger” myth — that serial predators commit most offenses against children. In reality, strangers carry out <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 7% of</span> these crimes. Statistically speaking, the greatest risks to children are their parents, other children and authority figures they know and trust.
Researchers consistently find that sex offenders are in fact less likely to reoffend than other criminals. A study of <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 1,800 sex</span> offenders across four states found that <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 10% reoffended</span> in the decade after their release from prison — far lower than <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 83% recidivism</span> rate for parolees convicted of other crimes.
Not only are registered sex offenders relatively unlikely to reoffend, but the registries themselves appear to have no effect whatsoever on recidivism rates. Numerous studies have found that enacting sex offender registries doesn’t reduce the rate of sex crimes and that states don’t see a drop in the number of abuse victims after enacting harsher requirements.
One of the most common restrictions on registered sex offenders is the “buffer zone” preventing them from living or working near schools, parks or playgrounds. While these restrictions may seem like an obvious safety measure, they too appear to have no effect on abuse or recidivism rates. An analysis <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 224 crimes</span> committed by known offenders in Minnesota found that residential restrictions would not have prevented even one. Another study in New Jersey found that <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 4.4% of</span> offenders met their victims in the types of public, children-oriented spaces the registry restricts.
“There isn’t any empirical relationship between where somebody lives and their likelihood of abusing a child,” Levenson said. Offenders will encounter children nearly everywhere, from grocery stores to city buses. The widest city and state buffer zones <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 2,500 feet</span>, or roughly a 15-minute walk. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">These measures, Levenson said, do little to protect children, but a lot to keep offenders from finding homes and jobs.
</span>If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that. If they’re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences. Michael Seto, forensic research director at The Royal Ottawa Health Care Group
Another common element of sex offender registries is public notification. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Every state requires offenders to notify their employers, landlords and neighbors of their status.</span> Some send out postcards to every resident within a two-block radius. Others offer mapping apps with photos and locations for each offender.
This, too, appears to have no impact on recidivism. In fact, most of the available evidence indicates that it makes reoffending more likely.
“There are already enormous barriers to reintegrating back into society after spending time in prison,” said Alexis Agathocleous, a civil rights lawyer who led a series of challenges to registration laws for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “Sex offender registries cement those barriers.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Winters said his registration status has made it nearly impossible to find employment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He worked at a Family Dollar before his arrest, but lost the job while he spent a month in pre-trial detention.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">He lost his last job, at a cafe, because his probation officer forgot to file the paperwork noting his new employer.</span> The oversight constituted a probation violation, which landed him in prison <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 9 months</span>.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">He got a new job washing dishes at a local diner after he was released.</span> His boss knows about his status and even showed up to testify to his character during one of his probation hearings. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Despite Winters’ stellar work record, though, he can’t get a promotion ― Tennessee’s registry restrictions forbid him from taking jobs that could require him to supervise employees <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 18.</span></span> That also means he’s unlikely to get a raise from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $11.50 per</span> hour he currently makes.
“I don’t see the purpose of this other than keeping me miserable, poor and lonely for the rest of my life,” Winters said.
The rest of the country’s registrants face similar challenges. <span id=""11"" class=""red""><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 2014 survey</span> of sex offenders five years after their release from prison found <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 36% had</span> never found employment.</span> Another, <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> found that Florida registrants in counties with larger buffer zones around schools were more likely to be homeless. Numerous studies have found that being out of work and living on the streets significantly increase the risk of recidivism.
“People are less likely to reoffend when they have a sense of purpose,” Levenson said. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“The more you’re able to build relationships and stay in stable housing and employment, the more you’re going to be invested in not doing something that will cause you to lose it.”
</span>And these provisions also make rehabilitation and reintegration into society nearly impossible. In some states, drug treatment facilities and homeless shelters bar access to registrants. Some bar them from churches, a crucial source of stability for adults trying to get back on their feet. Notifying neighbors can encourage vigilantism and abuse toward offenders and their spouses and children.
“It’s profoundly discouraging,” Levenson said. “For every other crime you go to prison, you do your time and the sentence ends, but for this, there’s no end.”
Registries don’t work for high-risk sex offenders, either.
Perhaps Winters is an unfairly sympathetic protagonist for a feature about the excesses of sex offender registration. He’s young, his crime was nonviolent, and he’s never been accused of inappropriate contact with children.
Sam Albertson, on the other hand, isn’t so sympathetic. <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2002,</span> he molested his 9-year-old daughter. Six years later, she told a friend’s parents, who told the police. Albertson served eight years in prison and was released <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span></span> He will be on the registry for the rest of his life. (Albertson also declined to use his real name.)
The question for the state of Tennessee is what to do with Albertson now. As a condition of his parole, he is forbidden to leave the county where he was convicted. <span id=""13"" class=""red""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 1,000</span>-foot buffer zone around schools and playgrounds, however, leaves him few options for housing.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">He drives a forklift on the overnight shift, but his wages barely cover a weekly motel room in one of the few neighborhoods where he’s allowed to legally reside.
</span>The fees that come with his registration status have also made it hard to rebuild his life. The state requires him to <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $40 per</span> week on psychiatric treatment,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $200 every</span> six months for a polygraph test, <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $200 per</span> year for the police to notify his neighbors of his address. If he doesn’t pay his fees, he’ll be charged with a parole violation and sent back to prison. A month after he first spoke with HuffPost, he moved into his car. Now that his registration status has been changed to “transient,” he’ll have to <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">pay $50 per</span> month for an ankle monitor.
“I want to be a better person,” Albertson said, “but the system is designed to fail.”
Michael Seto, the forensic research director at The Royal Ottawa Health Care Group and a prominent expert on sex abuse and pedophilia, said that the current registration system doesn’t take into account the vast diversity of characteristics, motivations and recidivism risk among people who have committed crimes against children.
According to Seto, pedophiles — people who are attracted to prepubescent children — make up less than half of offenders who commit child sexual abuse. The rest suffer from a combination of mental illness or disability, other sexual disorders or disinhibitions due to drug or alcohol abuse.
Albertson appears to match this pattern. He said he’s never been attracted to minors. Molesting his daughter was an expression of emotional instability and his own history of sexual abuse, he said.
None of this excuses Albertson’s crime, of course. But registry systems rarely take into account the complexities of sexual abuse or incorporate evidence on the factors that will reduce reoffending. Even when they do split registrants into high-, medium- and low-risk categories, they typically base these assessments on their crime alone. This leaves out critical information about the circumstances of their crime and the factors that could lead them to commit another.
For registrants who aren’t attracted to children, restrictions like buffer zones around schools and postcards to their neighbors amount to disproportionate punishment. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">For registrants who are attracted to children, the high risk of homelessness, social ostracism and unemployment associated with their registration status may be pushing them in the wrong direction.
</span>“If someone has an attraction to children, they need energy to control and manage those feelings,” Seto said. “If you take away their social support and if they don’t have something to do with their time, you diminish their ability to manage their urges and increase the likelihood that they’ll drink or use drugs. That’s a much greater risk factor than living close to a school.”
Politicians are still unwilling to roll back sex offender registration laws.
The ineffectiveness of sex offender registries has been well-established for years, and yet lawmakers at every level are reluctant to roll them back.
Brandon Buskey, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Smart Justice Project, said he’s not aware of a single jurisdiction that has voted to loosen its registry requirements voluntarily. <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2016,</span> National Affairs noted that no enhancement of sex offender registry laws had ever failed a floor vote in a state legislature. Many pass unanimously and few earn any critical media coverage.
“The logic is that if they save even one life, then they’re worth it,” Buskey said. “That’s the sentiment that is keeping them alive: You can’t prove that they won’t help someone, regardless of how many people we know they hurt.”
Courts, however, are beginning to find this argument unconvincing. <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> judges in California and Michigan declared those states’ <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">longstanding 2,000</span>-foot buffer zones around schools unconstitutional. <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina’s law banning sex offenders from using social media violated the First Amendment. The same year, a Colorado judge ruled that the “public shaming and banishment” caused by public notification amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The provision now applies only to violent offenders.
But the process of overturning registry restrictions is achingly slow and confoundingly specific. Earlier this year, Georgia struck down lifetime electronic monitoring for sex offenders but deemed it acceptable for criminals on probation. A number of states have ruled that registration is unconstitutional for juveniles and when applied retroactively — but acceptable in all other circumstances. An Iowa judge <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004 declared</span> that there was “no evidence demonstrating that <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2,000</span>-foot ‘buffer zone’ actually protects children,” but his decision was later overruled by the State Supreme Court.
Seto said one of the reasons for the ongoing push-and-pull over sex offender registries is that American institutions still haven’t decided what purpose they are intended to serve. When they were first devised, registries were primarily a tool for law enforcement. By now, they have become a form of retribution, a reminder for offenders and their communities that they are nothing more than their worst moment.
“If registries are about safety or about helping to solve future crimes, then we need to set them up for that,” Seto said. “If they’re about punishment, then we need to admit it and deal with the unintended consequences.”
A real solution to child sexual abuse, Seto said, would be humane, individualized and comprehensive. It would include more widely available mental health treatment for offenders after their crimes and the rest of the population to prevent them from happening in the first place. It would also involve educating parents about where the real risks lie, informing children about boundaries and consent and reforming law enforcement agencies to encourage victims to report — and take them seriously when they do.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And while registries do have a role to play in reducing child sexual abuse —most researchers acknowledge that some offenders should not be allowed to work with children, for example — this goal could be achieved with targeted databases that that function more like background checks for employers and law enforcement.
</span>All of these steps would finally align America’s solution to sex abuse with the reality of the problem.
“We’re always worrying about the creepy stranger at the playground,” Seto said, “but if we want to solve this problem, we have to improve safety at home.”"

<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 10,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 10</span>:18 pm ET

MOSCOW—When the Russian government needed to build up infrastructure in the southern city of Sochi ahead of <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2014 Winter</span> Olympic Games, it turned to Russia’s most important lender: Vnesheconombank, the country’s state-owned development bank.

</span>Russian President Vladimir Putin said private investors would be responsible for most of the Olympic costs, which ballooned to an <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated $50 billion</span>. But VEB ended up picking up much of the tab, eventually holding the equivalent of at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least $2.9 billion</span> in overdue loans.

Now, the bill is coming due. VEB for years kept its books in balance by borrowing heavily from foreign lenders. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But after being slapped with sanctions by Europe and the U.S. following Russia’s annexation of Crimea <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014,</span> the bank faces the task of paying off <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $20 billion</span></span> in foreign-currency debt, <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 billion</span> of which comes due this year, with much-diminished access to capital markets.

</span>“On the asset side, the key problem is bad loans,” said Yegor Fyodorov, a senior credit analyst at ING Bank in Moscow. “On the liability side, the problem is that VEB was very exposed to international capital markets. And when sanctions were implemented, VEB was cut from this channel.”

VEB didn’t respond to several requests for comment.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The trouble at VEB—which has the equivalent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $56.9 billion</span> in consolidated assets, equal to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5.5% of</span> Russia’s gross domestic product—is a significant issue for the Russian state.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">In late March, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the government will provide the bank with the equivalent <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.2 billion</span> so the lender can manage its outstanding debt.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Sergei Gorkov, the new head of VEB, said Tuesday that the funding had helped the bank to meet all of its debt obligations but that the bank would develop a long-term strategy by <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Russian authorities are already struggling to guide the country’s oil-dependent economy through its worst downturn in years.</span> Analysts estimate that VEB will need at <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 300 billion</span> rubles ($4.47 billion) in relief this year. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But the Russian government has pledged to hold <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1.5 trillion</span> ruble budget deficit it projected in December down <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% of</span> GDP.</span> It has already slashed health-care and education spending and frozen pensions and state salaries.

“We weren’t very happy with the idea,” said a person familiar with the bailout plan for VEB, which <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 133 billion</span> rubles in the first nine months <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015.</span> “But there is an old rubbish bin of assets that someone should sort out—you can’t just pretend that this rubbish bin doesn’t exist.”

The person said the government was pushing VEB to both stop acquiring new assets and to sell or spin off some of what it already owns.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Bond traders are betting the bailout is a virtual certainty, sending prices higher.

</span>“VEB is one of my biggest bond positions,” said one trader. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The government knows that it will not let VEB default.”

Founded <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1922 by</span> Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin to foster trade after years of revolution and civil war, VEB was revamped <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 under</span> Mr. Putin as a development bank tasked with everything from financing major infrastructure projects to boosting exports.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> the bank turned into a dumping ground for bad assets and money-losing state projects. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">It bought two struggling lenders, Sviaz-Bank and Globex, to shore up the country’s banking system during the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> VEB bought the debt of a large pulp-and-paper factory on the shores of Siberia’s Lake Baikal.</span> The heavily polluting factory was unable to break even and it shut down soon afterward. VEB said in a statement that it planned to find a private company willing to undertake <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $88 million</span> project of rehabilitating the polluted area, but two years later, little has been done.

The bank has also become a lever for bolstering Russia’s influence in neighboring Ukraine. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The former head of VEB, Vladimir Dmitriev, told Russian television <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 that</span> the bank had <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $8 billion</span> investing in metals and mining in eastern Ukraine, where economic activity has come to a near-standstill because of fighting between Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed rebels.

</span>It appears increasingly unlikely that VEB will be repaid for the costliest projects. Many of VEB’s biggest debtors in Sochi are in talks to restructure the loans.

Russia’s largest state bank, Sberbank, for example, spent <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 52 billion</span> rubles in loans from VEB to build a major ski resort in Sochi, called Krasnaya Polyana, which records show <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 20.8 billion</span> rubles <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> In <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015,</span></span> Sberbank management told Russian news agencies that it was selling Krasnaya Polyana to another company that was created less than a month before the deal. Sberbank didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">VEB’s bad-loan problem worsened when Russia’s central bank, in an attempt to save the ruble from hitting record lows, jacked the key interest rate up <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% from</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10.5% in</span> a single night in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2014.</span></span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">That move rippled through the banking system and sparked a wave of defaults, as institutions previously squeaking by with loan repayments were suddenly faced with interest rates they couldn’t afford.

</span>By <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015,</span></span> Russian government officials publicly acknowledged that VEB would likely have to be rescued. In February, Mr. Dmitriev was replaced with Mr. Gorkov, who previously held senior positions at Sberbank and at the oil company Yukos. The bank’s top executives aren’t the final word, however.

“In all of the key projects that are now the cause of their problems, decisions were taken by the government, and then the management agreed,” said Karen Vartapetov, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s. “So there’s not much that the actual management of the bank can do if the government asks or requests to invest money into some projects.”

79651,"<h3>Saudi Oil Attack Is the Big One</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday’s attack will linger over the energy market

Updated Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 7</span>:28 am ET

Saturday’s attack on a critical Saudi oil facility will almost certainly rock the world energy market in the short term, but it also carries disturbing long-term implications.

</span>Ever since the dual 1970s oil crises, energy security officials have fretted about a deliberate strike on one of the critical choke points of energy production and transport. Sea lanes such as the Strait of Hormuz usually feature in such speculation. The facility in question at Abqaiq is perhaps more critical and vulnerable. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Wall Street Journal reported <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 5.7 million</span> barrels a day of output, or <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 5% of</span> world supply, had been taken offline as a result.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">To illustrate the importance of Abqaiq in the oil market’s consciousness, an unsuccessful terrorist attack <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006 using</span> explosive-laden vehicles sent oil prices more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $2.00 a</span> barrel higher.</span> Saudi Arabia is known to spend billions of dollars annually protecting ports, pipelines and processing facilities, and it is the only major oil producer to maintain some spare output. Yet the nature of the attack, which Iranian-supported Houthi fighters from Yemen claimed was the result of an attack by their forces, shows that protecting such facilities may be far more difficult today. U.S. officials blamed Iran and U.S. and Saudi officials were investigating the possibility that another Iranian-backed group carried out all or part of the attack using cruise missiles launched from Iraq. Iranian officials on Sunday denied responsibility for the attacks.

There are countries that even today see their output ebb and flow as a result of militant activity, most notably Nigeria and Libya. Others, such as Venezuela, are in chronic decline due to political turmoil. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Such news affects the oil price at the margin but is hardly shocking.

</span>Deliberate attacks by actual military forces have been far rarer, with the exception of the 1980s “Tanker War” involving Iraq, Iran and the vessels of other regional producers such as Kuwait. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">When Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1990,</span> removing its production from the market and putting Saudi Arabia’s massive crude output under threat, prices more than doubled over two months.

</span>Yet Saturday’s attack could be more significant than that. Technology from drones to cyberattacks are available to groups like the Houthis, possibly with support from Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That major energy producer, facing sanctions but still shipping some oil, has both a political and financial incentive to weaken Saudi Arabia.</span> The fact that the actions ostensibly were taken by a nonstate actor, though, limits the response that the U.S. or Saudi Arabia can take. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Attempting to further punish Iran is a double-edged sword, given that pinching its main source of revenue, also oil, would further inflame prices.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">While the redundancies in Saudi oil infrastructure mean that output may be restored as soon as Monday, the attack could build in a premium to oil prices that has long been absent due to complacency.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, traders may now need to factor in new risks that threaten to take not hundreds of thousands but millions of barrels off the market at a time.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">U.S. shale production may have upended the world energy market with nimble output, but the market’s reaction time is several months, not days or weeks, and nowhere near enough to replace several million barrels.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">After the smoke clears and markets calm down, the technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday’s attack will linger over the energy market.

Delta Variant and Rise in Cases Has New Yorkers ‘Scared All Over Again’
The city is grappling with a new surge in cases and questions. The only shared emotion is uncertainty.
For a fleeting moment, New York was a city reveling in itself. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Just a month ago officials declared it fully open for business; masks slipped to chins and restaurants packed in customers as vaccines rolled out.</span> The virus seemed to be losing.
Today, the coronavirus has crept back, in a new, more infectious form that has driven up cases and hospitalizations, primarily among those still refusing vaccination, sending a city just staggering back to life into a tailspin.
For some New Yorkers, scarred from the thousands of deaths at the pandemic’s painful peak, every new case, though few in comparison, comes with pit-of-the-stomach foreboding. For others, the spiking rates, and the fact that if infected, few vaccinated people fall gravely ill, portend a new reality of cohabiting with the virus — maybe indefinitely.
Perhaps the only shared emotion is uncertainty. As the variant known as Delta entrenches across the city, there are questions in its wake: Is this simply what the future looks like? Despite a maskless, celebratory summer of social closeness, is the pandemic forever?
“It’s like the flu, the flu never stops,” said Nelson Lopez,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 45,</span> a resident of East Harlem, who said he still cannot walk down his block without tallying every neighbor he lost to the virus. “People will be afraid forever.”
Over the weekend, Hua Cheng,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 55,</span> and her husband, Keith Hu,<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 60,</span> both electrical engineers, drove in from their home in Randolph, N.J., to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a city that suddenly once again felt precarious. When they got out of their car, they pulled on masks.
“I thought I was safe!” said Mr. Hu, at the foot of the museum steps. The couple are back to wearing masks, even though they are vaccinated, as the Delta variant has continued to spread. “Before this we didn’t take it seriously,” Mr. Hu said.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that vaccinated people should return to wearing masks in public indoor spaces in areas that have recorded more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50 new</span> infections <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">per 100,000 residents</span> over the previous week, or where more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8 percent</span> of tests are positive for infection over that period.
All of New York City’s boroughs fall under those criteria. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has resisted reinstating a mask mandate, said at a news conference on Wednesday that his administration was reviewing the C.D.C. guidelines. The mayor announced that the city would begin <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">giving $100 to</span> residents who get their first dose of a vaccine at a city-run site, starting Friday.
The seven-day average of new coronavirus cases is <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,000,</span> up from just <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 last</span> month, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 75 percent</span> are attributed to the Delta variant, according to city data. Though the numbers of patients hospitalized for coronavirus in New York City remain at just <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 300,</span> they account for <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 75 percent</span> increase from earlier this month. The vast majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated people, according to the city.
“The Delta variant has really thrown us a curve ball,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference last week, at which he announced that all public sector health care workers must be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">On Monday the mayor expanded the mandate to all of its <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 340,000 city</span> employees, setting the deadline for mid-September.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that state employees would be required to show proof of vaccination or face weekly testing under new state policy that will go into effect by Labor Day.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Earlier this week, California introduced similar mandates, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced that all of its frontline health care employees must get vaccinated within eight weeks or face penalties, including removal.
</span>Latest Updates
For some, like Julissa Matos,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 31,</span> the news has changed decisions about getting vaccinated: “I did not want to get vaccinated,” Ms. Matos said as she watched her nieces play in a fountain in a park in the South Bronx over the weekend. “I feel like they were just experimenting, and I didn’t want to be an experiment.” <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 45 percent</span> of residents are vaccinated in the borough, the lowest vaccination rate in the city.
On Monday, Ms. Matos took her 12-year-old son, Cleon Clarke, to Lincoln Medical Center in Mott Haven where they both got vaccinated, fearful that he might contract the virus when he leaves soon for sleep-away camp in Pennsylvania. Last week, an outbreak at Camp Pontiac in Columbia County, N.Y., had sickened more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 campers</span>, all of them too young to receive vaccines.
“As I am going to sleep for the past two weeks now, something in my heart just keeps telling me to get him vaccinated,” Ms. Matos said. “I am just starting to get scared all over again.”
Others say the increasing cases are not changing their behavior at all.
On Staten Island, Daniel Presti was helping set up a friend’s bar on Victory Boulevard on Friday evening. The bar he used to manage, Mac’s Public House, was shut down last year by the city after Mr. Presti and its owner, Keith McAlarney,<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 47,</span> repeatedly violated city lockdown rules intended to reduce the spread of the virus — something the men said they felt infringed on their personal liberties. It became a center of the coronavirus culture wars.
Today Staten Island’s South Shore has some of the highest number of coronavirus cases in the city. Mr. Presti,<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35,</span> said he does not believe the data showing rising case numbers. “I do not think that we should have destroyed lives for a virus that is highly survivable,” he said.
“I will not change the way I am doing things,” he added.
The Orthodox Jewish enclaves of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, were some of the hardest hit by the coronavirus at the peak of the pandemic, which tore through tight-knit families and killed influential religious leaders. For Tova Schiff, who is in her 80s and survived the virus, a possible resurgence is chilling.
Understand the State of Vaccine Mandates in the U.S.
- College and universities. More <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400 colleges</span> and universities are requiring students to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Almost all are in states that voted for President Biden.
- Hospitals and medical centers. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Many hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities, even within their work force.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In N.Y.C., workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or else get tested on a weekly basis.
- Federal employees.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">President Biden will formally announce on Thursday that all civilian federal employees must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or be forced to submit to regular testing, social distancing, mask requirements and restrictions on most travel.</span> State workers in New York will face similar restrictions.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">- Can your employer require a vaccine?</span> Companies can require workers entering the workplace to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to recent U.S. government guidance.
“You don’t know when it will end, or how it will,” Ms. Schiff said. “Will it get worse than it is now or will it just disappear?”
Ms. Schiff was hesitant to get vaccinated, but ultimately decided to get a shot. “I was afraid to do it, I was afraid not to do it,” she said.
Outside the Queens Public Library in Flushing, a group of young people were handing out fliers of information on the vaccine in English and Chinese to passers-by. In the New World Mall food court nearby, Cyrus Lee,<span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 32,</span> was sitting with his 1-year-old daughter. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Nearly 85 percent</span> of Flushing residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to city data.
Mr. Lee saw the pandemic up close. His extended family in China experienced the virus months before it came to America, he said. When it arrived here, he cared for patients hospitalized for Covid-19 at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he is an office assistant.
His parents, who live in Sunset Park, hardly left the neighborhood for a year after the pandemic began, afraid for their safety after a slew of hate crimes targeting Asian people.
With the increase in cases, Mr. Lee said he was afraid the same violence would continue: “It never went away,” he said. “They blame Asians still.”
Hiking through The Ramble in Central Park, Navdeep Shergill,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 41,</span> his wife, Ajinder,<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> and their three young children each wore a mask as they scrambled over rocks and down trails.
The Shergills were visiting from Folsom, Calif.
“Covid is here to stay,” said Mr. Shergill, who, like his wife, is vaccinated; their children are too young to qualify. “You can’t turn Delta variant off and go back to life as normal.”
Behind her mask, Ms. Shergill nodded. “This,” she said, “is a way of life.”

President Trump is an exception. In an interview with Time magazine, published on Thursday, Mr. Trump veers from topic to topic, praising himself and dismissing his critics in language that sometimes is hard to follow.
For a detailed fact-check into Mr. Trump’s assertions in this interview, see this New York Times article by Linda Qiu.
Here are several passages from the interview, and analysis on what they show about how Mr. Trump thinks.Continue reading the main story
An ‘Instinctual Person’
I’m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right. When everyone said I wasn’t going to win the election, I said well I think I would. You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, The New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 1 percent</span>. Well, I said, “No, I think I am going to win,” and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed, you remember. He thought it was very cute, and very funny. Other people smiled. And some people, the smart people or the people that know me, didn’t laugh at all. There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn’t laugh at all. They thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me. They get it. — President Trump
If there’s one thing that Mr. Trump hates, it is being laughed at. That is clear from this response in the Time magazine interview, when the president dismissed the critics who found humor in his pursuit of the White House.
It is also worth remembering how flustered and angry Mr. Trump appeared to be when President Barack Obama made fun of him — and made a roomful of people laugh — during <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2011 White</span> House correspondent’s dinner. Mr. Trump has said he will not attend this year’s dinner.
No matter if the facts currently contradict him, Mr. Trump appears to have convinced himself that he will be proved correct — always — in the future.
Just Quoting
Why do you say that I have to apologize? I’m just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano. I quoted Judge Napolitano, just like I quoted Bret Baier. I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don’t know where he has gone with it since then. But I’m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks. — President Trump
Among Mr. Trump’s more bizarre assertions in recent days — and repeated in the Time interview — is the idea that he should not be held accountable for merely quoting someone who makes a controversial, even unproven, claim or allegation.
That idea flies in the face of the longstanding expectation that everything a president says matters. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Previous presidents have been careful, for example, not to say anything that could move financial markets.</span> Mr. Trump (along with Sean Spicer, his spokesman, who similarly quoted Andrew Napolitano during a briefing) appears to believe that quoting someone else shields him from that expectation.
* BONUS: Mr. Trump asserts in this passage that Mr. Napolitano had “three sources” for a claim about British intelligence conducting surveillance on Trump Tower. That is particularly ironic, given Mr. Trump’s attacks on the news media for using anonymous sources.
‘Very Sad’ About Sweden
I am talking about Sweden. I’m talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about. That is what I am talking about. You can phrase it any way you want. A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened. I talked about Brussels. I was on the front page of The New York Times for my quote. I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels. I was absolutely lambasted. A short time later they had the major attack in Brussels. One year ago today. Exactly one year ago today. And then people said, “You know, Trump was right.” — President Trump
One of the staples of Mr. Trump’s rhetorical repertoire is trying to rewrite what he said in the past to fit a new set of facts that has since been revealed. This passage in the Time interview is a classic example: His comments about Sweden during a rally referred to some alleged situation the previous night. Now, in the interview, he makes it seem as though he had been prescient, anticipating a riot that happened several days later.
Mr. Trump uses this tactic a lot. But he may find it more difficult now that he is in the White House, since by tradition just about every word a president utters is transcribed.
How Life Works
I happen to be a person that knows how life works. I said I was going to win the election, I won the election. In fact, I was number one the entire route, in the primaries. From the day I announced, I was number one. And The New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win. We thought we were going to win the night of the election. — President Trump
Central to Mr. Trump’s self-image is his belief that he is smarter than the people around him. Throughout his campaign, he often bragged that he knew better than the doubters, who he predicted eventually would be proven wrong.
In addition to contradicting some of his previous assertions (in which he acknowledged that he had not known whether he would win), this passage in the interview underscores the extent to which Mr. Trump rarely allows any self-doubt to creep into his thinking.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">‘I’m President, and You’re Not’
I inherited a mess with jobs.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can’t get a job,</span> O.K. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And I inherited a mess on trade.</span> I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder. But that’s the story. Hey look, in the meantime, I guess, I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not. You know. Say hello to everybody, O.K.? — President Trump
All presidents want to know how they are doing after moving <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 1600 Pennsylvania</span> Avenue. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And many denigrate the job of their predecessor; Mr. Obama often criticized the economy and the foreign policy he inherited from President George W. Bush.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Trump is no exception, and this passage shows his willingness to rely on the same positive jobs numbers that he frequently dismissed as a candidate.
</span>But his response at the end of this interview also shows how Mr. Trump’s mind works: His victory in November is the last word in the success of his administration.Continue reading the main story"
