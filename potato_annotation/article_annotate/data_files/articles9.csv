Bill Gross’s flagship fund dropped more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% Tuesday</span>, an unusually big decline for a bond fund in just one day, and a sign of how the shockwaves from this week’s sudden moves in European markets are reverberating.

Instead, German prices jumped, sending yields plummeting, following the apparent collapse of a prospective Italian coalition government over the weekend.

</span>Mr. Gross’s fund <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.04% Tuesday</span>, ranking it last in performance among similar funds this year, data tracker Morningstar said. Similar funds returned, on average, <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.22% decline</span> <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 through</span> Tuesday, Morningstar said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Gross’s fund <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.34%.</span>

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The fund’s decline on Tuesday was the latest setback for Mr. Gross, the onetime “bond king” who built Pacific Investment Management Co. into a dominant force in the debt markets, with more <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $200 billion</span> at one point under management in his Total Return Bond Fund.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Mr. Gross appeared to signal a call for selling German bonds in his first-quarter letter to investors, noting that a March statement by the European Central Bank had paved the way for higher interest rates across the continent.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Unconstrained bond funds like Mr. Gross’s are free to invest in a wider array of securities than those with more traditional fixed-income investments, like U.S. government and corporate bonds.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The declines in Mr. Gross’s fund are an example of how vulnerable investors can be to sudden reversals in market sentiment at a time of low, if erratically rising, interest rates and strong demand for income-generating investments.

</span>“Even for unconstrained bond funds, it’s rare for such a sharp decline,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA.

Mr. Gross gained a global following in part for making bold predictions on the markets—and placing outsize bets on those convictions. <span id=""6"" class=""red""><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2011,</span> as manager of the world’s largest bond fund at Pimco, he famously sold all of his U.S. Treasury holdings and used derivatives to place wagers against government-related bonds.</span> Those trades, among others, left Mr. Gross’s funds far more susceptible to wrong-way bets than his peers, former colleagues have said.

Slumping performance, client defections and a feud with some of his colleagues greased his exit from Pimco, a firm he co-founded decades earlier. He jumped <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 to</span> the smaller Janus Capital Group Inc., where the Unconstrained Bond Fund <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">manages $2.08 billion</span>. That is down from its peak this year <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.23 billion</span>.

Mr. Rosenbluth said Mr. Gross may have been caught flat-footed during Tuesday’s selloff of Italian bonds. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">He had argued that the yields on ultrasafe German bonds would rise, reflecting improving economic prospects throughout Europe and an increased willingness among investors to take on risk.

</span>Instead, the spread between yields on Italian and German 10-year bonds <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit 2.83 points</span> on Tuesday, widening <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2.05 on</span> Friday <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1.57 in</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2018.</span>

The spread between Italian and German bonds was unchanged <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2.828 points</span> on Wednesday, Thomson Reuters said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Stock benchmarks in Europe and the U.S. edged higher.

</span>Calls to a spokeswoman with Janus Henderson Group PLC, formed through <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 merger</span> between Janus and the U.K.’s Henderson Group, weren’t returned. Reached through a spokesman, Mr. Gross declined to comment.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s move on Sunday to block the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government has reignited fears that the continent’s third-largest economy would exit the currency union, a concern that rattled markets because any move to drop the euro or default on existing bonds could fuel significant losses among European lenders and impair economic growth.

</span>Mr. Gross’s Global Unconstrained Bond wasn’t the only mutual fund caught up in the selloff. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Managed-futures funds, which bet that market trends will continue, also fell sharply as one of those themes—rising U.S. interest rates—reversed course.

</span>AQR Capital Management’<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $10 billion</span> Managed Future Strategy, the biggest of the group, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 2.1% on</span> Tuesday on losses from its shorts, or bearish bets, on U.S. government-bond futures.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The LoCorr Market Trend Fund, another managed-futures fund, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">declined 2.2%,</span> while the Equinox Campbell Strategy Fund <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2.51%.</span>

</span>Many traditional bond funds fared better.

<span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $2.1 billion</span> Pimco Active Bond ETF, an exchange-traded fund once run by Mr. Gross, <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 0.6% on</span> Tuesday. <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $3.2 billion</span> SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, run by DoubleLine Capital LP’s Jeff Gundlach, also <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 0.6%.</span>

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Morningstar’s director of fixed-income manager research, Miriam Sjoblom, noted that the Pimco and DoubleLine ETFs are two of a breed of actively managed funds that rarely make the sort of esoteric bets that likely hurt Mr. Gross’s performance.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">But even some ETFs with sizable allocations to Italian debt outperformed Mr. Gross.

</span>Italian bonds account <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 20% of</span> the iShares International High Yield Bond ETF, which <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 1.7% on</span> Tuesday. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The $11.8 billion</span> Vanguard Total International Bond ETF, which <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 8.3% of</span> its portfolio in Italian debt, slid <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 0.22%.</span>

</span>“In a diversified bond portfolio, where you had some Italy exposure, you generally held up OK,” Ms. Sjoblom said.

In his first-quarter letter, Mr. Gross said European investors had “piled into the region’s safe havens, namely German Bunds,” earlier this year after stocks declined sharply, Mr. Gross wrote. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">German bond yields, which had been on the rise as the nation’s economic picture improved, also plummeted, he said.

</span>“Given these conditions, it is difficult to find the rationale for [10-year] <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Bunds to be yielding <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 0.50% and</span> yields on German government debt up to six years in maturity to be negative,” he wrote.

</span>At Janus, Mr. Gross’s fund outperformed many of its peers in <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2016,</span> in part by snapping up shares of Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and selling credit-default insurance on Brazilian and Mexican bonds.

558,"<h3>The Former Afghan Central Bank Chief Says the Taliban Can’t Access Most of the Country’s Reserves</h3>Advertisement
The former Afghan central bank chief says the Taliban can’t access most of country’s reserves.
The former acting governor of the Afghan central bank, who has fled the country, said on Wednesday that nearly all of the bank’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $9 billion</span> in reserves were beyond the reach of the Taliban, who took over the country’s government over the weekend.
Ajmal Ahmady, who was appointed to the central bank just over a year ago, said nearly all the money was held overseas, <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $7 billion</span> in assets by the Federal Reserve. In a series of Twitter posts, he added <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that $1.3 billion</span> in assets were held by other international accounts and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $700 million</span> were held by the Bank of International Settlements, which is based in Switzerland and acts as a bank for central banks.
“We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">perhaps 0.1</span>-0.2 percent of Afghanistan’s total international reserves,” he wrote. “Not much.”
On Tuesday, a Biden administration official said access has been blocked to Afghan central bank reserves held in the United States. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">This action, which was taken by the Treasury Department, will put economic pressure on the Taliban as they seek to keep public services operating.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Separately on Tuesday, a group of lawmakers sent a letter to the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, urging her to intervene in the scheduled release <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $650 billion</span> in International Monetary Fund emergency reserves this month.</span> The allocation, of so-called special drawing rights, would potentially give Afghanistan and the Taliban access <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $450 million</span>.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">On Wednesday, Mr. Ahmady wrote that Afghanistan was reliant on obtaining shipments of cash every few weeks because it had a large current account deficit.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(Afghanistan imports about five times more goods than it formally exports.)
</span>“The amount of such cash remaining is close to zero due a stoppage of shipments as the security situation deteriorated, especially during the last few days,” Mr. Ahmady wrote.
On Friday, the central banker received a call saying the country wouldn’t get further shipments of U.S. dollars, though the next one was supposed to arrive on Sunday. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Saturday, Afghan banks requested large amounts of dollars to keep up with customer withdrawals, but Mr. Ahmady said he had to limit the currency that could be sent to the banks to conserve the central bank’s supply.</span> He said it was the first time he made such a move.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Mr. Ahmady added that he told President Ashraf Ghani about the currency shipments being canceled and that the Afghan president then spoke with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.</span> Though he said the shipments were approved “in principle,” they never arrived the next day.
“Please note that in no way were Afghanistan’s international reserves ever compromised,” he wrote.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Without access to these reserves, Mr. Ahmady wrote, the Taliban will probably have to put capital controls in place and limit access to dollars, beginning a cycle in which the national currency, known as the afghani, will depreciate and inflation will rise rapidly.</span> On Tuesday, the afghani reached a record low <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 85.4 to</span> the U.S. dollar, but appreciated <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 3 percent</span> on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data.

New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait: '12 gallons of milk a week may sound like a lot, but they've actually had to cut out their milk baths on alternate days'
A large family featured on CNN discussing the rising costs of basic groceries like milk was mocked by some progressive media figures on Thursday.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">To demonstrate the ""squeeze"" of inflation and supply chain issues on everyday Americans, CNN's ""New Day"" featured the Stotlers, a Texas couple looking after nine children – two of whom are their biological kids, while they've adopted six more and have one foster child.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Krista Stotler said she started seeing prices rising this summer and it was costing them an <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">extra $100 a</span> week on groceries.
</span>""A gallon of milk <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $1.99.</span> Now it'<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $2.79.</span> When you <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy 12 gallons</span> a week times four weeks, that's a lot of money,"" she said, as her husband Larry added he felt guilty that they were being forced to buy less healthy food to save money.
FOX NEWS POLL: <span id=""3"" class=""red"">HIGH VOTER WORRY ON INFLATION AS BIDEN ECONOMY RATINGS PLUMMET
Liberals jumped on the segment and appeared to mock the family's concerns.
</span>""12 gallons of milk a week may sound like a lot, but they've actually had to cut out their milk baths on alternate days,"" snarked New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait.
The New York Times account on crossword puzzles also got into the act, tweeting – and deleting –, ""sorry, i can't do today's crossword. i'm too busy carrying <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">my 12 gallons</span> of milk home.""
CNN anchor Brianna Keilar's tweet of the segment got thousands of responses, many of them from left-wing accounts mocking the family for buying that much milk. Some didn't appear to realize the size of their family, which was only apparent from watching the segment.
""Nobody mentioning that she thought PF Chang's was the healthy stuff,"" joked Rex Chapman, a left-wing Twitter personality.
""Who <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buys 48 gallons</span> a month?"" Daily Beast contributing editor Goldie Taylor wondered.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">GROCERY STORE SHOPPERS SOUND OFF ON SURGING PRICES
Other reporters and pundits dinged CNN for the segment, with some saying they couldn't be right about milk being that cheap earlier this year and the family wasn't indicative of a typical American household.</span> It's unclear what average grocery costs have been in the Stotler's Dallas-area town.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS WAGES RISING FASTER THAN INFLATION
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">""It’s certainly possible that the Stotlers got a gallon of milk <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $1.99 at</span> some point on sale, and <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $2.79 price</span> as of today is what a gallon of Kroger-<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">brand 2 percent</span> milk costs at the Texas store shown in the CNN clip, according to Kroger’s website,"" Vice reported, while arguing it wasn't due to crisis inflation levels.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""The Stotlers may be wrong about the significance of random milk price fluctuations, but their angst over inflation and the general state of the economy is shared by millions of other Americans.</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">""
Evan McMorris-Santoro, the CNN correspondent who interviewed the family, blasted critics of the piece, saying it was remarkable how many were trying to ""dunk on a charming family who lays out how it feels to shop with price rises.</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">""
""Glad you're all weathering the economy so well!""</span> he wrote.
At one point in the segment as she checks out from her local Kroger, Krista notes the bill is already <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $90 with</span> a lot of groceries still left, but reminds herself, ""God is good and always provides.<span id=""10"" class=""red"">""

42397,"<h3>The most popular type of home in every major American city, charted</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The detached, single-family home — far and away the most common style of housing in America — is rare in Washington, D.C.</span> Only about one <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 homes</span> inside the District is designed this way, with a private front door to the city, maybe a yard in the back, some buffer space keeping the neighbors at bay. Windows all the way around!
Instead, we live differently here: with meager lawns (if we have any at all), common stoops, shared walls (or ceilings), and echoes of our neighbors' dubious TV choices.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">The District is a city of row homes and modest apartments, which makes the feel of the place — and your housing options here — significantly different from what you'd find in New York or Chicago or Kansas City.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The above chart, based on <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">new 2014 American</span> Community Survey data on the characteristics of occupied housing, breaks down these differences.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">A quarter of all housing in DC is in rowhomes.</span> One-third, as <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2014,</span> was in large apartment buildings <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20 units</span> or more, a share that will no doubt grow as new apartments emerge downtown and in Southeast.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Half of the occupied housing in Baltimore, in contrast, is in row homes (a whole lot of the unoccupied housing there is, too).</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Nearly half of the housing in New York is in large apartments.</span> Detroit, a spread-out city now struggling mightily to shrink with grace, has vast stretches of single-family homes on par with newer car-centric cities in the South and West.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">These figures tell us not just about the physical character of each city, but the potential they have for new housing as many places (Detroit not withstanding) look for space to fit a growing urban population.</span> Higher density, in all of these cities, doesn't have to mean Manhattan-style mega-rises.
A parcel of land that has traditionally been zoned for a single-family home could fit several rowhouses. A hundred-year-old rowhouse — as Washington has witnessed — can become a three- or four-unit condo. A stretch of land that fits several houses can also accommodate a modest-scale apartment building fitting three times as many families.
As this chart shows, there are a lot of options between the traditional single-family home and the tower. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">And there are few cities in America — including those with conspicuously rising housing costs — that don't have room in the mix for more of them.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Seattle, for one, has been reassessing this summer all the land it has historically protected for single-family homes in an effort to create more affordable housing.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Seattle has, in fact, a greater share of that kind of housing than Los Angeles.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">(This debate, though, is not going well, since political power in cities also tends to accrue to the left end of this housing spectrum.)
</span>L.A., for its part, is often described as a poster child for sprawl (an accusation aimed at both the city itself and the broader metropolitan area). But L.A. is actually one of the denser places in America, thanks to its many modest-scale multi-family buildings.

Coronavirus collides with Latin America’s maid culture — with sometimes deadly results
RIO DE JANEIRO — Every weekday morning <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 years</span>, housekeeper Bety Santos has left her Rio favela to take a crowded bus to the wealthy seaside district of Barra da Tijuca. But the family she serves there now frightens her.
It’s the rich — those who can afford to travel or study abroad — who brought the novel coronavirus to Latin America. But it’s the poor, she believes, who will pay.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Her employer, a 71-year-old physician, returned from Paris recently with a cold.</span> Though she tested negative for the coronavirus, Santos, who cooks and cleans for the family, can’t shake her anxiety — or her mounting annoyance. Governments are urging social isolation. Officials have asked the upper classes to put their maids on paid leave. But she’s still working.
“They cannot survive without me,” said Santos,<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 48.</span> “They depend on me for everything. ‘I lost my glasses: Do you know where they are?’ ‘Next to the bed.’ ‘Where is the control for the TV?’ ‘Over there.’ <span id=""4"" class=""red"">I am scared of catching it from [my boss], but it’s not an option for me to be unemployed right now.</span> I am a worker.”

EasyJet, the British budget airline that grew to become one of Europe’s largest carriers, announced Monday that it would ground all of its planes due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
</span>“As a result of the unprecedented travel restrictions imposed by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the implementation of national lockdowns across many European countries, easyJet has, today, fully grounded its entire fleet of aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement carried by ITV News.
“At this stage there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">We will continuously evaluate the situation based on regulations and demand, and will update the market when we have a view.</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">""

EasyJet had announced last week that it would be suspending most of its flights. Many of the flights that went ahead served to repatriate customers stuck abroad.
More <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 300 planes</span> will be grounded under the current plan. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Cabin crew on grounded flights will be furloughed for two months <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">on 80 percent</span> of their salary under the British government’s job retention program.

After nearby Iran, Saudi Arabia is the worst hit in the region by the coronavirus pandemic with the steepest rate of increase of any of its neighbors.
The Red Sea port city of Jiddah was also locked down on Sunday, with a curfew starting <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 p</span>.m. and all entrance and exit from the province barred. The holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the capital Riyadh were similarly locked down on Thursday, while the local outbreak epicenter of Qatif, in the east, was closed the week before.
The suspension of all public transportation as well as domestic and international flights in the country has also been extended until further notice.
Less than a third of the new cases were linked to travel, according to the Health Ministry, <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 68 of</span> them traced to transmission from the infected already inside the kingdom.

Local governments plan to convert the venues into hospitals and vaccine centers for what is expected to be a surge of novel coronavirus cases.
The country’s most famous stadium, the iconic Maracanã sports complex in Rio de Janeiro, will become a temporary hospital. The Maracanã stadium held the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 Summer</span> Olympics and is among the best-known soccer stadiums in the world. It first was used for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1950 World</span> Cup, and authorities have not decided how many beds it will hold or whether they will be placed on the playing field or elsewhere in a complex that also houses a track and field stadium and an aquatic park.
Brazil’s covid-19 cases <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approached 4,000 last</span> week, the Associated Press reported Sunday, with more <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 deaths</span>. Although President Jair Bolsonaro has sought to downplay the severity of the illness, Brazilians were demanding tough measures: A Datafolha poll this month found <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 73 percent</span> of those surveyed supported total social distancing. Bolsonaro told reporters last week that he believes Brazilians are protected by natural immunity.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">A pro-Trump community in Florida sits at nexus of debate over reopening economy
FORT MYERS, Fla. — Hours after her father died, an angry and distraught Lori Hannaford typed out <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3 a</span>.m.</span> Facebook post aimed at anyone still walking around this laid-back city as if the world wasn't reeling from a pandemic caused by a deadly virus with no vaccine and no cure.
“I hope you never have to lose a spouse and be unable to touch them, be in their room, or say goodbye to them,” she wrote, a short time after changing her Facebook cover photo to a picture of her stepfather kissing her on her wedding day. “I hope you never have to lose your father and be unable to hug your mom and be consoled because you have to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">stay 6 feet</span> away.”
Before New York hospitals were flooded with coronavirus cases and Florida <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">topped 3,000 cases</span>, this tourist haven near the Gulf of Mexico was the first city on the Eastern Seaboard to report a death from the virus, a woman who had traveled overseas and died on <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 5.</span> Hannaford’s stepfather, John Gness, was the virus’s second victim here, succumbing to a fatal combination of covid-19 and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had battled for the final years of his life.
The pandemic-related deaths jolted a region that boasts low crime, paradise-like weather <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 50 miles</span> of white-sand beaches — a year-round vacation destination that city leaders admit can feel immune to the problems that plague other places.
Now, weeks into the crisis, Fort Myers sits at the emotional nexus of a growing — and increasingly politicized — national debate over what to do next.
Popular Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies of coronavirus
TOKYO — Veteran Japanese slapstick comedian Ken Shimura has died after contracting the new coronavirus, local media reported on Monday, marking the first high-profile death in the country since the outbreak began.
Shimura,<span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70,</span> was a member of a Japanese comedy band The Drifters (not to be confused with the American R&B group) and starred in the group’s prime-time television comedy show “Hachijidayo Zeninshugo!” (“It’<span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8 o</span>’clock, gather round everyone!“) that was popular with children but not so much with parents.
The TV show, launched <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1969,</span> has one of the highest ratings in Japanese television history.
Shimura, who said in his memoir that he drew inspiration from Jerry Lewis, “captured the hearts of all generations with his penchant for funny faces and ability to deliver jokes as if they were unscripted,” Kyodo News reported, noting sketches such as the “mustache dance” and characters such as the “stupid lord” and “strange uncle.”
Before Shimura joined the band, the Drifters were famous for a very brief opening act at the Beatles first concert in Japan <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1966.</span>
Shimura, who was still working in television when he fell ill, was hospitalized on <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 20 after</span> developing a fever and was
diagnosed with severe pneumonia, Kyodo reported. He tested positive for the virus on <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 23.</span>
FDA approves unlimited use of Battelle mask-sterilizing technology after lobbying from DeWine, Trump
Battelle has received full emergency authorization to sterilize N95 face masks so that they can be re-used, the Food and Drug Administration announced late Sunday.
The decision followed a weekend of intense lobbying by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), who previously criticized the FDA for putting limits on the use of the new technology.
Battelle, a Columbus, Ohio-based nonprofit, says that its decontamination system is capable of sanitizing up <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80,000 respirator</span> masks per day. Initially, however, the FDA issued only a partial waiver of its usual rules, which restricted Battelle to <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cleaning 10,000 masks</span> per day.
DeWine slammed that decision in a Sunday morning news release, calling it “reckless,"" and Ohio’s attorney general threatened to sue. Later on Sunday, President Trump said that after speaking with DeWine, he had contacted the head of the FDA to see if the limitations could be removed.
I have just talked with @realDonaldTrump about this issue, and we had a good conversation. He understands the problem and says he will do everything he can to get this approved today. Thank you, @POTUS. https://t.co/iha2F2AXgv— Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 29,</span></span></span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020
The</span></span> FDA revised its stance late Sunday night, saying that it will no longer be putting a limit on how many masks can be sanitized in a given day. In a news release, DeWine’s office said that Battelle plans to ship its machines to New York and Washington state, in addition to using them in Ohio.
“We‘re grateful that the President and the FDA moved quickly to help us get this solution back up and running,” said a statement from Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. “This Ohio-driven solution has the potential to save lives now and in the future across the United States.”
China’s Xi seen in public for first time during outbreak without face mask, party media says
In a photo released by Xinhua on Sun, President #XiJinping was seen, for the first time, inspecting a public place without a face mask since the onset of the outbreak. He was seen adhering to health protocols by maintaining a distance from others on a dock. pic.twitter.com/Q7DrRIkUFS— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 30,</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020
Chinese</span> leader Xi Jinping appeared in public without a face mask for the first time since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in the country, Chinese media stated on Monday.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the ruling Communist Party, shared a photograph of Xi with a bare face from a visit on Sunday to the Ningbo-Zhoushan port in Zhejiang Province.
Other photographs from the visit published by state-run Xinhua News Agency show Xi and others accompanying him wearing masks.
Though the World Health Organization and other health organizations have advised against the wearing of surgical masks in most circumstances, Xi has been seen repeatedly wearing one in public. When the Chinese president visited the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, on <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 10,</span> he wore a mask and spoke to patients via video link.
China has been announcing consistently low numbers of new cases. There were <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 new</span> cases on Sunday, according to official figures, and none in Hubei, the province that was at the heart of the outbreak, for the sixth day. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Though the Chinese government has pushed the country to resume economic activity, some experts worry that the figures may mask a lingering outbreak in the country.
</span>De Blasio says New Yorkers can be <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fined $500 if</span> they defy orders to break up gatherings
New Yorkers who defy police orders when told to break up gatherings can be fined up <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to<span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $500,</span></span> New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) told reporters on Sunday.
Gatherings of any size are prohibited in New York state, and the New York Police Department has been authorized to issue summonses and fines at parks, playgrounds and places of worship where people ignore social distancing regulations and refuse to disperse, De Blasio said. Those fines can range from $250 <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to<span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $500,</span></span> and will also apply to people who return to gatherings after being told to leave.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">De Blasio emphasized that the penalty would be only used as a last resort, saying that he didn’t want to fine people “when so many folks are going through economic distress.”</span> But, he added, “if they haven’t gotten the message by now, and they don’t get the message when an enforcement officer’s staring them in the face [...] that person then deserves the fine.”
“You’ve been warned and warned again,” De Blasio said.
South Korea <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">announces 78 new</span> cases as concerns grow about clusters in Seoul
South Korea <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">announced 78 new</span> cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday, along with six deaths, according to an announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
The country has seen a steady rate of new cases for almost two weeks, with <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 100 new</span> cases each day since <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 11.</span> The total number of deaths from the country’s outbreak <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 158 so</span> far.
However, concerns grew that greater Seoul, the country’s bustling capital and its sprawling satellite towns, had become new hub for the outbreak.
New infections reported in Seoul and neighboring Gyeonggi Province and Incheon came <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 31,</span> surpassing the number found in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, earlier epicenters of the Korean outbreak.
The outbreaks in the Seoul region have been linked to a call center and a church that held services in violation of the government’s social distancing policy.
Andrew Cuomo during the covid-19 crisis is the same as ever, with one big difference: People like him
One odd side effect of covid-19 has been what it does to taste. Even those who have avoided the illness enjoy things they once disliked: Government spending. Facetiming with family.
Andrew M. Cuomo.
The governor of New York’s morning news conferences have become part of the country’s new daily rhythm. And to the surprise of anyone who has watched his State of the State, it’s must-see television.
First come the facts. In a matter of days, there are no cases, <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">then 30,000 cases</span>, then <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 cases</span> in New York state. “That’s a problem,” he says. They are running out of beds and ventilators. He doesn’t shy away from that. “That’s a challenge.” He pauses.
“Take a breath,” he says, and when he starts to talk again it is the revival portion of the meeting. There are moving stories about New York, his mother, his father and all of humanity. The density of the state — its “closeness,” he says — is its vulnerability in this moment. But it is also what will get it through. He is talking to New York but the whole country is listening to the Cuomo Monologues: part briefing, part sermon, part inspirational talk.
The coronavirus crisis has reintroduced the nation to a different cast of Democratic leaders. Former vice president Joe Biden — the supposed standard-bearer of the party — has been largely missing, as governors like Jay Inslee of Washington state, Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan find the spotlight. And no one is on a bigger stage right now than Cuomo.
Analysis: Trump beats a retreat on opening the country as coronavirus data, images show dark reality
For six days straight, President Trump talked about reopening the country quickly. He wanted people filing into offices again, diners returning to restaurants and shoppers gathering at malls without fear of contagion.
Trump mused about a reopening date of <span id=""67"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 12,</span> picking it arbitrarily because he thought it would be beautiful to see church pews packed with parishioners on Easter. Then he dug in, seeming to tune out the nearly unanimous assessment of public health experts and governors and mayors fighting to help save lives, which was that Easter would be far too soon because the worst still was yet to come. As the self-described wartime president saw things, the novel coronavirus was a “silent enemy” and America was defeating it.
What a difference a week makes.
Trump beat a hasty retreat on Sunday, announcing from the Rose Garden just before dusk that the federal government’s stringent social distancing guidelines, set to expire on Monday, would be extended through <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""68"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 30.</span></span>
Japan uses targeted coronavirus testing; South Korea goes big. The U.S. faces a choice.
TOKYO — In East Asia, two rivals are grappling with the coronavirus pandemic in very different ways: mass testing versus targeted testing.
It's a debate over tactics that has profound implications in the United States and elsewhere, as health officials struggle to find the best methods to track and contain the virus.
South Korea has won global praise for swiftly making coronavirus tests widely available and has already tested more <span id=""69"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 394,000 people</span>. It has <span id=""70"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 9,583 infected</span> people.
Japan, a country whose population of <span id=""71"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 127 million</span> is more than twice that of South Korea, has conducted more <span id=""72"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 48,000 tests</span> on <span id=""73"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approximately 28,000 people</span> and <span id=""74"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 1,724 cases</span>.
For weeks, Japan has been gripped with a debate. Is the country seeing fewer infections than South Korea simply because it is testing fewer people? Is the Japanese government marshaling its resources wisely, or burying its head in the sand?
As in the United States, Japan’s government was criticized in the early weeks of the outbreak for failing to expand its testing capacity.
Japan has since expanded testing capacity, but the Japanese Medical Association said it has <span id=""75"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">identified 290 examples</span> in which doctors requested tests for sick people but were unable to obtain them.
As Trump declared coronavirus under control, local leaders faced confusion and chaos as cases piled up
As a mysterious respiratory illness tore through China and other countries in mid-January, Kyle Coleman, an emergency management coordinator in Texas, took inventory of his team’s personal protective gear at a warehouse in Bexar County.
The hazmat suits and gloves were in good condition. Some of the respirator masks had expired. Three pallets of hand sanitizer seemed like enough because they seldom used more than one pallet a year.
Over several weeks in January, Coleman followed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus: the first death reported in China on Jan.<span id=""76"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,</span> the spread to Thailand and Japan, and then the first U.S. case in Washington state confirmed on Jan.<span id=""77"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21.</span>
The next day, President Trump, in an interview on CNBC, assured the public: “We have it totally under control.”
But Coleman thought it was only a matter of time before it arrived in Bexar County, home to <span id=""78"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 2 million</span> residents, including those in the city of San Antonio. So on Jan.<span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23,</span> Coleman purchased <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 25,000 respirator</span> masks.
“You would read one story one day, and then you get another story the next day, and it wasn’t the same message coming out,” Coleman said. “But it kind of looked like it was bad, so we started ordering supplies.”

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">In recent years, there have been two kinds of Fed chairmen: commanding personalities such as Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, whose views on inflation and interest rates dominated central banking from the 1980s through the mid-2000s; and the consensus-driven leaders, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who guided the central bank toward more open decision-making and de-emphasized the power of the chairman.

</span>Mr. Powell, judging by his nearly 40-year career in government, law and banking, is likely to be in the latter group. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">That means a Powell Fed might look a lot like it has since Mr. Greenspan retired <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span>

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Such continuity would be welcome in the markets, which don’t like uncertainty, and at the Fed, one of the world’s most powerful economic policy-making bodies.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">It also could please Mr. Trump, who has spoken approvingly of record stock prices and declining unemployment.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">His appointment could also cause friction within the Republican Party, where many rank-and-file members want to see the Fed roll back a decade of central-bank activism sparked by the financial crisis.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In the weeks leading up to the selection, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said he thought the Fed should “move in a different direction.”

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The president opted against offering the job to two candidates more popular with the Republican establishment—former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor—after advisers raised concerns that their past support for higher interest rates could unsettle Wall Street, according to two people familiar with the deliberations.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“I would be surprised if [Mr. Powell] walked away at the end of his term with a huge stamp of reshaping the Fed,” says Charles Plosser, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2015 worked</span> closely with Mr. Powell.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“He’s not likely to lead Federal Reserve reform and innovation on monetary policy, but that does not mean he won’t be a good chair.”

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Unlike Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Powell doesn’t hold a degree in economics—which would make him the first chairman since the late 1970s without such a credential.</span> Although he has worked as an investor, lawyer and bank regulator, he has no experience leading a large organization.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Because Mr. Powell isn’t an economist, he might be more likely to rely on Fed economists.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">He also might be less dug in and more flexible than Ph.D.s on some intense economics debates, such as whether low unemployment is a precursor to rising inflation.

</span>Mr. Powell, who is known as Jay, declined to comment for this article.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">The Fed is no simple bureaucracy.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">It has a seven-member board,<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 regional</span> banks, a secretive decision-making process and<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2,</span>700 employees involved in interest-rate decisions, bank regulation and managing the nation’s currency circulation.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">It also serves as the Treasury’s fiscal agent in managing the nation’s debt.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">It is in the process of raising short-term interest rates from near-zero levels and of gradually winding down <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $4.2 trillion</span> portfolio of mortgage and Treasury securities built up during and after the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell was part of a group <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 that</span> pressed Mr. Bernanke to wind down the bond-purchase programs, although he has never dissented <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 44 meetings</span> on the Fed board.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s most notable mark on monetary policy at the Fed was his involvement in bond-buying phase out.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Worried that investors believed the programs would continue indefinitely, he joined with two other Fed governors, Betsy Duke and Jeremy Stein, to persuade Mr. Bernanke to scale the program back.</span> The effort was typical of Mr. Powell’s style—conducted almost entirely behind the scenes and with little fanfare.

The initial effort was rocky. Bond investors grew frightened, sparking a selloff known in markets as the “taper tantrum.” <span id=""25"" class=""red"">But they eventually settled and the Fed is now gradually reducing its portfolio.</span> Mr. Powell later conceded that his concerns about continuing the programs were overblown.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell’s views on economic and monetary policy sync up with Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He has supported a slightly lighter touch on financial regulation but hasn’t backed wholesale efforts to dismantle overhauls implemented following <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">In testimony before lawmakers this summer, he said those rules made the financial system “substantially stronger and more stable.”

</span>“Jay is certainly not going to change course in any radical way, but he’s very smart. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">He will react to whatever shifts are out there,” says Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and an occasional adviser to Republican presidential candidates, who has known Mr. Powell <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>.

</span>A Washington native, Mr. Powell,<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 64 years</span> old, grew up the second of six children in suburban Chevy Chase, Md., where he still lives. His father was a lawyer; his mother worked part time for the Republican National Committee.

Like his father, he attended the Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit high school. His parents were active in civic and charitable causes, many centered around their church. Mr. Powell also has served on the boards of educational and environmental groups.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Matthew McCormick, an economist who has worked for several federal agencies, recalls seeing Mr. Powell last year carrying a car seat and luggage for someone else’s family trying to make a tight connection at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va.

</span>Mr. Powell has a somewhat conventional Washington résumé. He went to Princeton University and Georgetown Law School. He worked for several years as a lawyer in New York before joining investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. <span id=""31"" class=""red""><span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> he returned to Washington to become assistant secretary for domestic finance in President George H.W. Bush’s Treasury Department, following the bank’s former chairman, Nicholas Brady, who was Treasury secretary.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">He later was promoted to undersecretary for domestic finance, charged with untangling a wave of bank failures.

</span>One Sunday morning in <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 1991,</span> Mr. Powell joined other regulators in a conference room to hash out how to deal with the collapse of the Bank of New England, at the time one of the region’s largest banks. To prevent a bank run, the group decided to guarantee all deposits, no matter how large they were, Mr. Powell recalled in <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2013 speech</span>.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Later that year, Mr. Powell helmed the government’s response to the Treasury auction bid-rigging scandal by Salomon Brothers, a major investment bank.</span> Mr. Powell ironed out an agreement that imposed severe penalties against the bank, which had admitted making unauthorized bids, without forcing it into bankruptcy, and arranged for investor Warren Buffett to become the firm’s chairman.

<span id=""34"" class=""red"">“It was a very ticklish, tricky thing, and it was exceptionally well handled at the end,” says John Dugan, who served under Mr. Powell at Treasury.

</span>The episodes of the early 1990s, which showed Mr. Powell to be relatively pragmatic, shaped his regulatory worldview, says Mr. Dugan. <span id=""35"" class=""red"">“He understands there’s a role for regulation, and he’s not at one extreme or the other,” says Mr. Dugan, who was U.S. comptroller of the currency <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2005 to</span><span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010.</span>

</span>After Mr. Bush left office, Mr. Powell returned to banking in New York. <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1997,</span> he moved back to Washington and joined the Carlyle Group, a private-equity investment firm, where he founded and led the firm’s industrial group within its U.S. buyout fund. It was lucrative work. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">In financial disclosures earlier this year, Mr. Powell, who drives a Tesla, reported assets worth <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $19.7 million</span> <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $55 million</span>.

</span>After nearly two decades in the private sector, colleagues say, Mr. Powell was eager to return to public service but wasn’t sure how or where to make his mark. He went to work at the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center, where he didn’t draw a salary.

<span id=""37"" class=""red"">“This was getting his feet back into the water and figuring out where he wanted to get engaged,” says Shai Akabas, an economist at the center who worked closely with Mr. Powell.

</span><span id=""38"" class=""red"">He landed at the Fed almost by accident.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">In a closed-door meeting with House Republicans in <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2011,</span> he challenged his own party over its standoff with President Barack Obama about authorizing an increase in the national-debt ceiling.</span> He warned Republican lawmakers about the harm that would fall on retirees, veterans and other Americans if Congress didn’t authorize an increase in government borrowing, according to two people who attended.

<span id=""40"" class=""red"">Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner heard about his take-your-medicine stand and asked colleagues if Mr. Powell might solve another problem they were having, according to several people involved in the deliberations.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">The administration had been unable to get Senate Republicans to confirm its pick for a vacancy on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, and officials were struggling to come up with names of a Republican who might help break the impasse.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Impressed after their meetings with Mr. Powell, officials in the White House recommended his nomination for the job.</span> The Senate confirmed his nomination <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> and he was reappointed two years later.

Many Republicans weren’t thrilled, <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 voting</span> against him <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012 and</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 voting</span> against him <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>

<span id=""43"" class=""red"">Some GOP lawmakers have been ruffled by Mr. Powell’s unwillingness to publicly criticize the Fed’s regulatory agenda, which included implementing substantial provisions of <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Dodd</span>-Frank Act.

</span>That reluctance “just left some people flat,” says Rep. French Hill (R., Ark.), who remains friends with Mr. Powell after they worked together in the Bush administration during the early 1990s.

Mr. Hill says he can understand why some colleagues wish Mr. Powell had been more outspoken, but adds it isn’t Mr. Powell’s style to air his concerns publicly. “It’s not fair to assume what Jay Powell said or didn’t say in private,” he says. “He kept those views to himself.”

<span id=""44"" class=""red"">One person who has worked with several Fed officials in recent years says he often heard about petty personal rivalries or feuds between board members, but these people never had a bad word for Mr. Powell.

</span><span id=""45"" class=""red"">“He is remarkably undogmatic,” says Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University economics professor, Democrat and former Fed governor whose office was adjacent to Mr. Powell’s.</span> “He listens more than he talks.”

Mr. Powell has held several different roles on a board that has been plagued with vacancies in several years. He earned respect from colleagues for tackling unheralded operational tasks and technical issues, including managing payment-processing systems. He also boosted morale this summer when he oversaw the implementation of a relaxed summer dress code.

10692,"<h3>For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap</h3>WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”
What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.
But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.
</span>As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 landing</span>, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1969,</span> almost six years after his death.
[Remembering <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 in</span> a New York Times special section.]
The presidents who followed Kennedy accomplished remarkable things in space, including the development of the reusable space shuttle, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and its offspring, the robot exploration of the solar system and the construction of the International Space Station along with Russia and other partners. Yet none of it ever fired the national imagination as did humans traveling to other worlds.
“There was a time when science and space exploration just captured the soul of America,” said Douglas Brinkley, the presidential historian at Rice University and author of “American Moonshot,” a new book on Mr. Kennedy and the space race. “The problem is it’s easy to say, ‘Let’s go back to the moon and to Mars,’ but as they used to say in NASA — ‘No bucks, no Buck Rogers.’”
Indeed, other presidents never made it the priority Kennedy did, regardless of their sweeping words. “The key factor is they’re not willing to pay for it,” said John M. Logsdon, a prominent space historian and professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “Kennedy not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. None of the presidents since then have been willing to do anything like that.”
Advocates of space exploration hope Mr. Trump will succeed with his moon program, called Artemis, for the mythical Apollo’s goddess sister, if for no other reason than his relentlessness when he applies himself to a project or a cause. Being the president who returned humanity to the moon on the way to Mars would be the sort of splashy, high-profile spectacle that excites him.
Mr. Trump hosted Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and the family of Neil Armstrong on Friday in the Oval Office to mark what the president called “one of the great achievements ever.” Vice President Mike Pence, who heads a reconstituted National Space Council, plans to visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.
“NASA is back,” Mr. Trump boasted.
The hurdles, however, remain sky-high. Mr. Pence told NASA in March to accelerate its schedule to reach the moon <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2024,</span> the end of Mr. Trump’s second term if he wins re-election. NASA shook up its management to meet that goal. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But Congress has shown less interest in financing it, and the technical obstacles to such a timetable remain formidable.
</span>Mr. Kranz himself highlighted the challenge in an appearance this week at Purdue University, saying the national environment had changed. “Today, you have this marvelous technology — the books have been written, the kids are educated,” he said. “What we need is leadership that says, ‘Let’s go,’ and then you need unity within the nation that’s going to make it happen.”
Kennedy was “not that interested in space.” He was keen to compete.
Kennedy’s moon mission was born not out of the explorer spirit but a desperation to catch up in a space race the United States was losing. The Soviets had beaten the Americans by launching the first satellite into orbit <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1957 and</span>, just three months after Kennedy’s inauguration <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1961,</span> the first man. In a memo a week later, Kennedy demanded any space initiative that “promises dramatic results in which we could win.”
The answer was the moon. Six weeks after Yuri Gagarin’s orbit, Kennedy addressed Congress to set a goal, “before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” He followed up a year later in a landmark speech at Rice University: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”
For Kennedy, it was all about Cold War competition. “I’m not that interested in space,” he told his NASA administrator in a private meeting, where he made clear that space priorities other than a lunar landing meant little to him — as did arriving on the moon second.
Because of an assassin’s bullet, though, it fell to his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson — who unlike Kennedy was genuinely invested in space — to build the moon program into what it would be. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">While the space project enjoyed only shallow public support given its cost, the assassination made it a moral imperative to fulfill the martyred leader’s vision.
</span>But it would be their mutual rival, Richard M. Nixon, who would preside over the actual landing on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 20,</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1969.</span> Nixon relished making what he called the “most historic phone call ever made from the White House” to speak with Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin on the moon. But beyond that, Nixon was not especially engaged in the space program, which was seen as a Kennedy legacy.
In <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 1970,</span> less than a year after the first landing, Nixon signed a directive making space just another program that would compete for funding along with every other, the turning point to Mr. Logsdon. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">As interest and television ratings for subsequent Apollo launches dwindled, the final three moon missions were scrapped, ending the program with <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 17 in</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1972.</span>
</span>Nixon did authorize the development of the space shuttle, the principal path to space for Americans for decades to come, and he sealed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union that would lead to the docking of Apollo and Soyuz capsules in orbit <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1975 under</span> his successor, Gerald R. Ford.
But the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, while momentous geopolitically, also effectively ended the space race. If astronauts and cosmonauts could meet in space, there hardly seemed an urgent need to spend huge amounts of money on an antiquated competition. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">At its peak, NASA commanded more <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4 percent</span> of the federal budget; today it receives about half <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1 percent</span>.

“None of the administrations since Johnson were facing a proposition that what hung in the balance here was nothing less than the beginning of the end of the Cold War,” said Sean O’Keefe, a NASA administrator under George W. Bush. “This was a very dominant theme.”
Story Musgrave, a retired astronaut who flew six shuttle missions, said the original rationale for the space program proved to be its inescapable burden. “The trouble if you make it about winning is that when you win, you may not have” a reason to continue, he said. “Kennedy really did set us up for the total lack of vision that occurred after ’69 because we won.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Presidential visions are undone by financial realities.
</span>After a six-year hiatus, Americans returned to space <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981 with</span> the launch of the space shuttle Columbia only three months after Ronald Reagan took office.
Reagan embraced the program as a symbol of American optimism and ambition and, echoing Kennedy, announced to Congress <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 that</span> he was directing NASA to build a permanently manned space station “and to do it within a decade.”
But Reagan was most remembered for his moving speech after the Challenger blew up <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1986,</span> killing all seven on board, including the teacher Christa McAuliffe. “Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue,” he told a television audience, concluding with a tribute to the crew. “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.”
Hoping to reinvigorate the program, President George Bush announced on the 20th anniversary of <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11,</span> <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989,</span> an initiative to return to the moon and then to go to Mars. “Why the moon? Why Mars?” Bush asked. “Because it is humanity’s destiny to strive, to seek, to find. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And because it is America’s destiny to lead.”
Mr. Logsdon, the historian, who has written several books on presidents and the space program — most recently one on Reagan, published this year — said Bush came the closest any president has come to matching Kennedy’s vision and budget commitment, but the price tag caused sticker shock in Congress, and the idea went nowhere.
</span>When Bill Clinton took office, he revamped the program. “We had concluded that there was little point in putting astronauts on the moon again” unless it was done with a crewed base, recalled John Holdren, his science adviser. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">But as before, the estimated cost was enormous.</span> “We saw no prospect of such a sum materializing.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Instead, Mr. Clinton cut NASA’s budget and reimagined the program as a vehicle for international cooperation, converting Reagan’s envisioned space station into a joint venture with Russia as it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union.</span> By the time Mr. Clinton left office, Americans and Russians were living together on the International Space Station, and have since.
George W. Bush found himself repeating history. Like Reagan, it fell to him to pick NASA back up after a shuttle disaster when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> killing all seven on board. A year later, Mr. Bush set in motion plans to retire the aging shuttles in favor of a new set of powerful rockets and a crew capsule.
And like his father, Mr. Bush aimed to return to the moon <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020,</span> followed by a mission to Mars. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But even though Congress signed on and financed the start of the program, impatient politicians gave up when progress was slower and costlier than predicted.
</span>Trump sends mixed signals about his moon plan.
Barack Obama seemed less interested in space and killed Mr. Bush’s Constellation program to build the Ares rockets and Orion capsule even after it had begun test launches, calling instead for outsourcing manned spaceflight to commercial companies. As a result, since the shuttles were retired <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> Americans have had to rely on paid rides to the space station on Russian rockets.
Mr. Obama saw no need to return to the moon, proposing instead to land astronauts on an asteroid <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2025 and</span> then send them to Mars in the 2030s. Congressional Republicans scoffed and rejected the idea.
Mr. Trump came to office determined to reverse course, re-establishing the National Space Council abolished by Mr. Clinton. The president has relished surrounding himself with Apollo-era heroes like Mr. Kranz, Mr. Aldrin and the moonwalker Harrison H. Schmitt.
But Mr. Trump seems more enchanted with his plan to create a military Space Force and sends mixed signals about his own exploration program. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that “NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon,” but instead be focusing on Mars.
Even during Friday’s visit with the <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Apollo 11 crew</span>, he began grilling Jim Bridenstine, his NASA administrator, on why the agency was not simply heading directly to Mars. “We need to learn how to live and work on another world,” Mr. Bridenstine explained.
Plenty of space program veterans doubt that Mr. Trump will succeed. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“I don’t think that whoever has opted for this goal has any idea about its cost or practicality,” Mr. Holdren said.</span> “Sending humans to Mars would be such a complex and expensive proposition that I don’t believe it will be done at all unless major nations agree to do it together.”
Michael Foale, a retired astronaut who made extended stays on both the Russian space station Mir and the International Space Station, said <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 deadline</span> “is highly unlikely to be achieved.” But he said he would “fully support” the idea of returning to the moon for a sustained stay, not just another one-off visit.
“The danger of a Kennedy-Trump-style ‘go to the moon’ — and then leave — is that it will disenchant another two generations of the world population with traveling to the moon even if it is successful, and much worse if an accident occurs,” Mr. Foale said.
Still, some past officials see reasons for optimism. “There’s a lot more going for this period of time and this initiative to make this a more possible event than what we’ve seen in the past,” Mr. O’Keefe said. “The technology has developed at an absolutely staggering pace that has made this an achievable objective. We know a lot more about what it will take to achieve it.”"

More Hospitals Are Requiring Workers to Get Covid Vaccines
With some health care workers still refusing to be immunized, medical centers around the country are requiring shots as cases climb once again.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">More and more hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities and even within their work force.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Many hospitals say their efforts to immunize their employees have stalled, in much the same way the nation’s overall vaccination rates are stuck <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 60 percent</span>, behind many European countries and Canada.</span> While more <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 96 percent</span> of doctors say they are fully vaccinated, according to the American Medical Association, health care workers, particularly in rural areas, have proven more resistant even though thousands of workers have died from the virus and countless more became sick.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">One recent estimate indicated that one in four hospital workers were not vaccinated by the end of May, with some facilities reporting that fewer than half of their employees had gotten the shots.
</span>Some hospitals, ranging from academic medical centers like NewYork-Presbyterian and Yale New Haven to large chains like Trinity Health, are going ahead with a mandate because they recognize that the only way to stop the virus is to vaccinate as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. A large Arizona-based chain, Banner Health, announced Tuesday that it would impose a mandate, and New York City said it would require all health care workers at city-run hospitals or clinics to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.
Watching cases rise prompted Trinity Health, a Catholic system with hospitals <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 22 states</span>, to become one of the first major groups to decide earlier this month that it would mandate inoculations. “We were convinced that the vaccine can save lives,” said Dr. Daniel Roth, Trinity’s chief clinical officer. “These are preventable deaths.”
At UF Health Jacksonville, in Florida, the number of Covid patients being treated has surged to levels not seen since January, and only half of its health care workers are vaccinated, said Chad Neilsen, the director of infection prevention. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Seventy-five employees are out sick with the virus, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated, while more are waiting for test results.</span> “We are absolutely struggling for staffing right now,” he said.
“It’s like déjà vu,” said Mr. Neilsen, who described growing frustration with colleagues refusing to get the shots. “We have a reason to believe this could be over if people got vaccinated.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Despite dozens of virtual town halls, question-and-answer sessions and educational videos, many employees are wary.</span> “We still stagnated,” Mr. Neilsen said.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some employees want more data, while others say the process has been too rushed.</span> Many of the same conspiracy theories and misinformation — that the vaccines will make women infertile or contain microchips — hold sway among staff members. “Our health care workers are a reflection of the general population,” he said.
Hospital leaders and others plan to meet with state officials in the coming weeks about the possibility of imposing a mandate, he said.
Unvaccinated workers also continue to care for even the sickest patients, raising concerns that they will spread the infection, especially now that the highly contagious Delta variant comprises more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 80 percent</span> of the nation’s cases.
“Nowhere is this more important than in hospitals, where health care personnel — who have been heroic during this pandemic — are caring for patients with a wide variety of health challenges under the assumption that the health care professionals treating them are not at risk of acquiring or transmitting Covid-19,” Dr. David J. Skorton, the chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents teaching hospitals, said in a statement last Friday calling for a mandate.
With formal approval of the vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration potentially months away, hospitals find themselves at the center of the national debate over whether to impose mandates. While the vaccines are being offered under emergency use authorization, supporters argue there is ample evidence that the ones available in the United States are both safe and effective.
In states like Missouri, which has reported a sharp increase in cases, there is newfound urgency. “We felt we could not wait,” said Dr. Shephali Wulff, the director of infectious diseases for SSM Health, a Catholic hospital system whose headquarters are in St. Louis. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">SSM, where about two-thirds of employees are now vaccinated, is requiring everyone to get their first dose by Sept.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.</span>
</span>SSM’s decision was also motivated by concern that Covid infections could spike this fall when there could also be a surge in other respiratory infections. “We need a healthy work force going into the flu season,” Dr. Wulff said. “We do not have the time to wait for approval.”
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">But some systems are already worried about staffing shortages caused by departures during the pandemic, with many employees quitting because of the stress and burnout experienced by caring for Covid patients.</span> Hospitals are hesitant to risk losing more workers if they force the issue.
“They are afraid it could be a tipping point,” said Ann Marie Pettis, the president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, one of the professional organizations that is urging hospitals to require the vaccine.
At Mosaic Life Care, a small Missouri hospital group, executives are reluctant to adopt a mandate if other hospitals do not. “We have the potential to lose some caregivers to other systems,” said Joey Austin, a spokeswoman for Mosaic, which has vaccinated <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 62 percent</span> of its staff.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Many hospitals already require their employees to get a flu shot, a mandate that has been in place for over a decade.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">While that was also met by resistance from employees skeptical of the vaccines’ safety, it is now largely accepted.</span> Individuals can seek a medical or religious exemption, typically representing a small sliver of the work force, which hospitals say would also apply to the Covid vaccines.
Mandates “establish a social norm and say it’s an institutional priority,” said Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who emphasized that hospitals need to strongly encourage workers to voluntarily get the vaccines to be successful.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Unions like the National Nurses United <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 1199 S</span>.E.I.U. say they want members to be vaccinated but oppose making it a condition of employment.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">At the first hospital to impose a mandate, Houston Methodist, a group of employees sued to challenge the requirement but the lawsuit was recently dismissed.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 150 employees</span> ultimately resigned or were fired for refusing to meet the deadline for vaccination out of a total work force of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 26,000 people</span>.
</span>Hospitals say they are working hard to dispel much of the pervasive misinformation around the vaccines, even among physicians and nurses.
“I have to remind them that reputable scientists do not publish their findings on YouTube,” Dr. Wulff said. In addition to presenting hard data about the vaccine, she and her colleagues at SSM are also sharing their personal experiences, like getting vaccinated while trying to get pregnant. “What I’m finding is people are moved by stories and anecdotes,” she said.
“Generally it’s a lot of listening and homing in on what is driving their fear,” Dr. Wulff said.
Some high-profile systems like Intermountain Healthcare and the Cleveland Clinic are waiting. The clinic, which has a sprawling network <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 18 hospitals</span> in the United States, said existing policies, like masking and closely tracking infections, protect patients and workers.
“We know if we ensure these safety precautions are in place we know we can continue to keep our patients and caregivers safe,” said K. Kelly Hancock, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief caregiver officer.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">About three-quarters of employees are now vaccinated, and efforts are continuing “full force,” she said.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">At Intermountain Healthcare, based in Utah, “a good majority” of employees are vaccinated, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, medical director for infection prevention and control and employee health.
</span>If more safety data is compelling and the F.D.A. approves the vaccines, Intermountain may require immunization along with other hospitals in the state. “We are starting the conversation now in Utah,” she said.
The lack of full F.D.A. approval has also influenced other hospitals. Mass General Brigham, which has vaccinated more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 85 percent</span> of its work force, said it would adopt the requirement as soon as the vaccines were approved.
Some hospitals argue a mandate is not necessary. “In my opinion, there isn’t one right answer,” said Suresh Gunasekaran, the chief executive of the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics. <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 90 percent</span></span> of its workers are now vaccinated, he said, adding that he was confident that virtually everyone would be immunized by the end of the year.
The system has been “successful in chipping away” at vaccine hesitancy, Mr. Gunasekaran said, in part because Iowa was involved in the clinical trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Northwell Health, the large New York hospital group, does not require workers to be immunized against the flu but <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 90 percent</span></span> of its work force is vaccinated against it, said Maxine Carrington, Northwell’s chief human resources officer. It is taking a similar approach to Covid.
“We want people to be believers,” Ms. Carrington said, so they are better able to persuade the community at large to get vaccinated. She described the system as “pounding the pavement on education, education, education.” <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 76 percent</span> of its work force is currently vaccinated against Covid. Northwell will revisit the idea of a mandate after F.D.A. approves the vaccines, she said.
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Yale New Haven Health is now requiring employees to get vaccinated, as have the other hospitals in Connecticut.
</span>“From the very beginning, we messaged that it isn’t mandatory — yet. We emphasized the yet,” said Dr. Thomas Balcezak, the chief clinical officer for Yale.
“Health care has to lead,” he said.

34121,"<h3>The Politics of Self-Esteem</h3>Welcome to what I’ve called “the politics of self-esteem.” By this, I mean that increasing numbers of people, on both the right and left, and most with good intentions, have become politically engaged because it makes them feel better. It raises their self-esteem. This phenomenon predates Donald Trump’s candidacy, but it helps explain a Trump puzzle that baffles many observers.
By now, the puzzle is familiar. Trump repeatedly says things that seem (by conventional wisdom) hateful, offensive, stupid or simply wrong. But instead of these apparent missteps backfiring — sowing doubt about his competence and moral values — just the opposite happens. The more Trump flouts prevailing norms, the more popular he becomes among Republicans. The latest example: After proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which was widely criticized, his support among Republicans jumped <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 38 percent</span> in December <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 32 percent</span> in November, according to a Washington Post-ABC News survey.
Trump has not redefined politics, but he has exploited a fundamental change of recent decades. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Since World War II, much of national politics has involved a struggle for economic benefits.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1940,</span> the government transferred <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 7 percent</span> of national income from some groups to others.</span> Now, that share is <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 20 percent</span>. This remains a huge part of politics, as debates over highway spending, farm subsidies, taxes and so much more remind us. But spending decisions are incremental; sweeping shifts are unlikely. We’re not going to abolish Social Security.
Against this backdrop, politics is increasingly shaped by issues that are cast in moral terms: abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, global warming, guns, immigration and health care — to name a few. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Compared with most economic matters, these issues are much more combustible politically.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">On many economic questions, you can negotiate compromises that please, or displease, almost everyone equally.</span> There’s room for give-and-take. By contrast, compromises on moral questions are usually hard and often impossible.
The people who support these various moral crusades — again, right and left — are generally sincere. Liberals pledge to save the planet; conservatives vow to end illegal immigration. But their very passion suggests that they feel morally superior to their opponents and crave anything that strengthens their sense of superiority. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">They receive what I call “psychic benefits,” just as Social Security beneficiaries receive economic benefits.</span> Significantly, these psychic benefits do not require the enactment of legislative agendas. Anything that makes your side look good or the other side look bad will suffice.
What his supporters most like about Trump, even if they disagree with some of his policies (as some inevitably do), is that he defines himself — he does not let others do it for him, and this rubs off on them. It’s liberating. As he asserts his moral superiority over the judgments of the “political establishment” and “mainstream media,” so can his supporters defy others’ hostile judgments of their values. In the contest for the high moral ground, they have a champion and a spokesman. They feel better about themselves. These are the psychic benefits.
For the “political establishment” and “mainstream media” — admittedly ambiguous groups — this poses a dilemma. When Trump makes proposals that strike them as simplistic, unworkable, undesirable or, worse, racist, they have two choices, both bad. If they decide not to react, their silence may seem to condone policies that they abhor. The second choice is to denounce many of Trump’s ideas, but this plays into his hands because the more he is attacked by despised outsiders, the more popular and admired he becomes among supporters.
What results is a bizarre, though fascinating, spectacle. Trump proposes. His opponents (pundits, politicians, “experts”) pounce — criticizing and fulminating. And Trump’s popularity rises.
It is not inevitable that this cycle continue indefinitely. Trump may stumble. Some other candidate — or candidates — may soar. The avalanche of criticism may reach a critical mass, raising fresh doubts among some followers. Or Trump’s outsize ego may begin to offend onetime allies. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Politics is a fickle business.</span> Still, Trump’s success has so far stunned many veteran reporters and election observers who have underestimated his political skills.
The more durable lesson here concerns the politics of self-esteem. Our system of governance is increasingly infused with a sanctimony all along the ideological spectrum that makes political accommodation and compromise harder to achieve. Well-intentioned people often act in rigid ways that maximize their self-esteem while perversely making it harder for the country to govern itself.

</span></span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Fed says it’ll buy as much debt as it needs to cushion the blow of the virus.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Federal Reserve said it would buy as much government-backed debt as it needs to keep financial markets functioning, and unrolled a series of programs meant to shore up both large and small businesses, in a staggering, whatever-it-takes-effort to cushion the economic blow of coronavirus.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,” the central bank said in a Monday morning statement, adding that “the Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses.”
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed resurrected a massive bond-buying program — last used in response to the financial crisis — earlier this month, saying it would <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spend $700 billion</span> on Treasury securities <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $200 billion</span> in mortgage-backed debt.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But on Monday, the central bank said it won’t limit its purchases, instead buying “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.”
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">The central bank will also try to bolster the corporate bond market, which has been under pressure as companies shut down in the face of the virus.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Stocks tumble as Senate stalemate trumps Fed efforts.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Investors remained focused on the political stalemate in the U.S. Senate that has slowed a rescue plan for the American economy.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 fell</span> more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 4 percent</span>, even after the Fed unveiled its new bond buying program.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">Traders, while welcoming the Fed’s expanded plans to buy assets, largely remained cautious about the central bank’s ability to shift the trajectory of an economy that appears to be in free-fall because of the coronavirus crisis.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">“It is hard for the Fed to stimulate underlying demand.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">For that, fiscal stimulus is needed,” Randy Watts, chief investment strategist at William O’Neil, an equity research and advisory firm, wrote in an email.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">“The deal in the Senate of the fiscal stimulus bill is obviously disappointing.”
Senate Democrats on Sunday blocked action on an emerging deal to prop up the economy, halting the progress of a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $2 trillion</span> government rescue package.</span> They contended that the legislation failed to adequately protect workers or impose strict enough restrictions on bailed-out businesses.
Major indexes in Germany, Britain and France were lower and most Asian markets also fell.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">On Monday, forecasters at Morgan Stanley offered one of the grimmest assessments for how much damage the coronavirus could inflict on the American economy in the months to come.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The economists said in a research note that they now expect the economy to contract at an annualized rate <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2.4 percent</span> in the first quarter of the year and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 30 percent</span> rate in the second quarter — which would be the worst single-quarter drop recorded in modern American economic statistics.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">In that scenario, the unemployment rate would <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">approach 13 percent</span>, which would also be a record.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary dismissed speculation that President Trump will have to shut down the entire economy as “fake news” and pushed back against accusations that the government is implementing a corporate welfare program.
</span>Amazon’s delivery times lengthen for nonessential items.
Amazon has always guaranteed fast delivery times for items. That’s changing with the coronavirus.
Over the weekend and on Monday, Amazon sellers and customers of its Prime service found that delivery times for nonessential items were showing a much later delivery time of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 21.</span> Typically, Amazon Prime deliveries take one or two days to reach customers in the United States.

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">The Federal Housing Finance Agency authorized two government-backed mortgage finance firms — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — to begin making short-term loans to investors in mortgage-backed securities to provide them ability to meet payments to banks and other lenders, according to two people familiar with the agency’s plan who were not authorized to speak publicly.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The financing provided by Fannie and Freddie is intended to be a two-day bridge loan that will permit mortgage investors to avoid having to sell off assets in order to raise cash.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">The loans are of such a short duration because the underlying bonds will be flush with cash on <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 1 as</span> mortgage payments come in from homeowners and mortgage servicing firms, one of the people said.
</span>Small businesses seek a crisis lifeline beyond loans.
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">As small businesses such as restaurants, bars, gyms and hair salons are forced by the coronavirus pandemic to go dark and lay off millions of employees, frantic owners are desperate for government aid to help them salvage enterprises that can’t survive for long without customers.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">But the main federal lifeline offered so far — low-interest disaster loans — is unappealing to many people running on thin margins and leery of taking on debt they can’t afford to repay.

80490,"<h3>Hedge Funds Gear Up for Another Big Short</h3>Some money managers are looking to profit from potential trouble at some ‘alternative’ mutual funds and bond ETFs

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015

Wall</span> Street is preparing for panic on Main Street.

Hedge funds are lining up to profit from potential trouble at some “alternative” mutual funds and bond exchange-traded funds that have boomed in popularity among retirees and other individual investors.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Financial advisers have pushed ordinary investors into those funds in search of higher returns, a strategy that has come into favor as Federal Reserve benchmark interest rates remain near zero.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">But many on Wall Street worry that junk bonds, bank loans and esoteric investments held by some of those funds will be extremely hard to sell if the market turns, leaving prices pummeled in a rush for the exits.

</span>Concerns about such scenarios have been escalating for some time. Now, investment firms such as Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">APO 0.52</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LP are laying the groundwork to cash in if they come to pass.

Apollo has been raising money from wealthy investors for a hedge fund that snaps up insurance-like contracts called credit-default swaps that benefit if the junk bonds fall. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">In marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Apollo predicted: “ETFs and similar vehicles increase ease of access to the high yield market, leading to the potential for a quick ‘hot money’ exit.”

Guided by a similar outlook, Reef Road Capital LLC, led by former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. proprietary trader Eric Rosen, has been betting against, or shorting, exchange-traded funds that hold junk bonds and buying options that will pay off if the value of these high-yield securities falls.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“They are going to be toast,” David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital LP, said of the funds holding hard-to-sell assets like emerging-market debt and small-capitalization stocks.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“It will be one of our first levels of shorting the moment we start to see cracks, because it’s ripe with retail, emotional investors.”

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">In a way, the moves resemble efforts by some hedge funds to find a way to wager against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">At the time, the country brimmed with highly indebted homeowners who had been encouraged to borrow more in a low-interest-rate environment.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">John Paulson’s eponymous hedge-fund firm made billions of dollars betting against the subprime-mortgage market.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The risk now is that this latest era of low interest rates has made risky junk bonds, which pay relatively high returns, disproportionately attractive for investors.

</span>The hedge funds are taking aim at what is regarded by many on Wall Street as a weak spot in the markets. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Liquid alternative” funds have emerged as one of the hottest products in finance, fueled by a promise to deliver hedge-fund-style investing to the masses.</span> They use many of the same strategies as hedge funds, with wagers both on and against markets, but are open to less-wealthy investors with fees closer to mutual-fund standards.

Liquid-alternative funds manage a <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cumulative $446 billion</span>, according to fund tracker Lipper, up <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $83 billion</span> at the start <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2009.</span> High-yield bond ETFs, another popular product, manage more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $38 billion</span>, and in the week ended last Wednesday took in their biggest inflows on record <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.5 billion</span>, Lipper said.

Critics said both sets of products suffer from a similar weakness. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They promise investors the ability to trade in and out as they would with a stock, but the underlying securities trade far less frequently, meaning there may not be buyers waiting when the funds line up to sell.</span> The Securities and Exchange Commission allows mutual funds to <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">keep 15% of</span> their holdings in illiquid assets, or those that may take more than a week to sell.

Activist investor Carl Icahn brought the issue to the fore last week, saying at an investment conference that he feared a bubble was expanding in junk bonds thanks to the rush into high-yield exchange-traded funds run by companies like BlackRock Inc.

Managers of ETFs and liquid-alternative funds said they are well-protected against any tumult. Some have lines of credit to cover redemptions if needed and point to research showing that even during past crises, mutual-fund investors generally withdraw no more <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2% of</span> assets each month.

“A lot of the questions come from a fundamental misunderstanding of ETF mechanics,” said Matthew Tucker, a managing director at BlackRock, the top manager by assets of ETFs, with more <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> of such funds under its purview. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">He said that in past downturns, the firm’s high-yield bond ETF actually had increased trading volume from firms looking to make both bullish and bearish bets, making it easier to buy and sell shares.

</span>BlackRock asked the SEC last month for permission to borrow from some of its mutual funds to pay redemptions in others. Mr. Tucker said the practice won’t apply to the high-yield fund; a spokeswoman said the firm’s liquid-alternative products were among those it may use to take advantage of the practice. The SEC decision is pending.

Hedge funds’ pessimistic outlook is still unproved, as bond markets remain stable by historical standards. Apollo’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $140 million</span> fund dealing in credit-default swaps is <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 4% through</span> midyear, a person familiar with the matter said.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Debt issued by junk-rated companies recently traded at <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 98 cents</span> on the dollar, up from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 61 cents</span> at the end <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2008,</span> according to a Barclays PLC index.</span> But many doubters aren’t deterred and privately have been telling clients they see trouble ahead.

Hedge-fund firm Rimrock Capital Management LLC has doubled the proportion of cash it carries and shifted toward higher-grade, more easily traded bonds, so that is able to pounce quickly on any signs of distress, a person familiar with the matter said. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The idea is to offer the liquid-alternatives funds and ETFs cut-rate prices for thinly traded holdings like low-rated corporate debt and bank loans when they are forced to sell to meet daily redemptions.

</span>“It sounds like just one more promise of something for nothing,” wrote Oaktree founder Howard Marks in a memo to clients this year. “No investment vehicle should promise more liquidity than is afforded by its underlying assets.”

Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 6</span>:48 am ET

HANOI—On its face, Donald Trump’s deference to Xi Jinping at their summit was a victory for China, although not nearly the surrendering of U.S. leadership in Asia to the Chinese strongman that some critics allege.

Mr. Xi’s China, Mr. Trump said, paying fulsome tribute to the omnipotence of the newly crowned supreme leader standing next to him, could fix the North Korean nuclear crisis “easily and quickly.”

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Chinese trade abuses, he appeared to absolve Mr. Xi of all responsibility, provocatively suggesting there is honor in the way Chinese leaders game the global trading system to win advantage for their people.</span> “I give China great credit,” he said.

Look beyond the flattery, however, and a harder-edged strategy comes into focus.

As Mr. Trump lavished praise on the Chinese president—“You’re a very special man,” he purred—three U.S. aircraft-carrier strike groups prowled the Western Pacific. They are a reminder of the military options the Pentagon is weighing against Pyongyang, knowing that while China could do more to pressure Kim Jong Un to slow his nuclear buildup, Mr. Xi’s leverage is in fact limited.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, back in Washington, lower-level aides are dusting off a rarely used Cold War-era trade weapon that invokes national-security considerations to push back against Chinese steel and aluminum dumping.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The action reflects an acknowledgment that Mr. Xi has no intention of abandoning predatory industrial policies to bring China, in his words, “closer to the center” of the world, and that conventional counters to Chinese abuses, like World Trade Organization complaints, don’t work.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">All this suggests that a largely vacuous meeting in Beijing, featuring a high quota of bonhomie from Mr. Trump and a low measure of economic deliverables from Mr. Xi, may go down in history as the prelude to a face-off on trade and other contentious issues that Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened during his campaign but has so far conspicuously failed to bring on.

</span>Indeed, empty summitry may have been part of the White House game plan.

Both sides normally strain for agreements to show progress toward the all-round engagement that has been the Holy Grail of successive U.S. presidents since Nixon. This time was different. Nobody was fooled by <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $250 billion</span> in commercial deals signed. Some were already in the works, hastily packaged up for the occasion, while others were memorandums of understanding that mean just that—paper promises that often end up in the bin.

Focus exclusively on his gushing personal diplomacy and the view might be that Mr. Trump was played like a fiddle.

Dwell on the modest takeaways and the White House appears to have used the summit to signal it is no longer playing the old game of pretend. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Is this why, after Mr. Trump had left Beijing, his hosts figuratively ran after their guest with a more substantial offer—improved market access for U.S. securities firms and banks?</span> White House aides suggest this concession was granted, not demanded.

In this more nuanced reading of the summit from Washington’s perspective, Mr. Trump’s assigned role was to enhance a rapport with Mr. Xi that will help anchor the relationship in advance of expected turbulence ahead.

There was nothing subtle, though, about Mr. Trump’s address to Asian leaders gathered in the Vietnamese coastal resort of Da Nang. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In front of a group dedicated to multilateral trade, he thundered his insistence on one-on-one agreements.</span> Instead of offering a sweeping American vision for the region to compete with Mr. Xi’s “China Dream,” which often overrides the ideals and ambitions of smaller Asian nations, he came up with a slogan coined in Japan—a “free and open Indo-Pacific”—with hardly any elaboration.

Borrowing a line from Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Trump took a dig at the ethno-nationalism that imbues Mr. Xi’s dream, as well as his “Belt and Road” initiative: “The world has many places, many dreams and many roads,” he said to scattered applause. His America First stridency, though—“but in all of the world there’s no place like home”—was received in silence.

There’s his problem: The marketing of nationalism—each country for itself—creates fissures in Asia. Whether Mr. Trump is confronting North Korean nuclear terror, or Chinese territorial assertiveness, he needs an Asian coalition behind him, which means first of all promoting common values in a region of traders. Mr. Xi understands this, at least rhetorically. He got a standing ovation for his speech that spoke of “building a community with a shared future for mankind.”

Mr. Xi’s attempts to pose as the savior of open markets and globalization draw as much skepticism today as when he first pitched himself in that role at Davos this year. But what he offers is inclusion, not retreat.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Having forged the region in its own image—a free-trading and substantially democratic dynamo—the U.S. now risks bequeathing the fruits to a rising China.

34815,"<h3>U.K. Inflation Reaches 10.1% as Government U-Turns Cloud Outlook</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation returned to double digits in September, cementing expectations of another rise in the Bank of England’s key interest rate early next month even as the medium-term outlook for prices has been clouded by changes in government policy.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The sharp rise in world energy prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the U.K.’s inflation rate to four-decade highs, and prompted the BOE to raise its key interest rate more aggressively than it had planned before the war.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that consumer prices <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 10.1% higher</span> than a year earlier, a faster rate of inflation than <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 9.9% recorded</span> in August and back to July’s level, which was the highest <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">That was a higher rate of inflation than <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8.2% recorded</span> in the U.S. over <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> through September, but below <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10.9% rate</span> recorded in Germany for the same period.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">The BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee has indicated that it will raise its key interest rate for the eighth time in as many meetings when policy makers announce their next decision Nov.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“September’s consumer prices figures maintain the pressure on the MPC to hike bank rate substantially at its next meeting, despite the developing recession,” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</span> “The MPC still is a long way from being able to claim victory.”
The U.K.’s central bank first raised its key rate in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2021,</span> three months before the Federal Reserve began to lift its key rate. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Fed has moved more quickly, and its key rate now stands at <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 3% and</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>25%, while the BOE’s key rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 2.25%.</span>
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Recent reversals in government policy have clouded the outlook for U.K. inflation and interest rates.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The government announced a package of tax cuts on Sept.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 23 that</span> the BOE saw as likely to lead to higher inflation than it had expected to see when it last released forecasts, and a larger rise in its key interest rate.
</span>“As things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps thought in August,” BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey said Saturday.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, the government Monday reversed most of those tax cuts, cut the period over which energy prices would be capped for all households to six months from two years, and pledged additional tax rises and spending cuts.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Over the coming months, the energy price cap means that the rate of inflation is set to rise only slightly, with the central bank expecting it to peak <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 11% before</span> the end of this year.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But many households may now face sharply higher energy bills through much of next year, which would tend to keep inflation high for longer.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">However, tax rises and spending cuts will likely have the opposite impact on inflation <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">beyond 2023.</span>
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“Support for household energy bills will become targeted from next April, which will likely mean higher inflation <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2023,</span> but lower inflation in the medium term,” said Abbas Khan, an economist at Barclays.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Educational Debt Isn’t Necessarily Good Debt
Some parents tell their kids not to worry about taking on student-loan debt because it is “good debt.”</span> Investing in yourself is important, but it’s possible to invest too much. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">It’s important to consider your potential career path as well as your debt repayment strategy.
</span>Plenty of people are already in too deep. More <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2 million</span> borrowers have defaulted on their loans in the past six years.
Taking out loans isn’t a guarantee you’ll graduate. The think tank Third Way found that at more than a third of American colleges, less than half of the students will earn a credential within eight years.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">And even if you do make it to graduation, who’s to say the degree could win you your dream job?</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Four <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 recent</span> college graduates are in jobs that don’t require degrees, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.
</span>After college, you may want to consider graduate school as a means of moving your career forward. But is it worth it to borrow tens or even hundreds of thousands for that advanced degree?
If your starting salary out of grad school will be more than the loans you take out to cover your education costs, it’s probably a good investment, says Mark Kantrowitz, vice president of research at savingforcollege.com. If you check this box, you should be able to pay off your loans <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 years</span> or less.

You can also think incrementally. <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Is the amount you will gain in salary after completing a graduate program more than the debt that you must take on to get the degree?</span> If so, it makes sense. For example, <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $50,000 to</span> get a nursing degree is a good investment if your salary will immediately jump <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $30,000 as</span> a home health aide <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $80,000 as</span> a registered nurse.
<span id=""28"" class=""red"">You might not have to pay big bucks for a multiyear program to land the job you want.</span> New specialized graduate degrees are becoming more popular. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">A master of business analytics, which generally takes one year to earn, might suit you better than a traditional two-year M.B.A. and leave you with less debt.</span> Instead of a three-year law degree, check out master of legal studies programs. <span id=""30"" class=""red"">They take one to two years to complete, can often be done online and cost <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $20,000 to</span><span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $45,000</span>—often cheaper than a year of law school.

Don’t Assume You Should Buy a Home
A home of one’s own remains an integral part of The American Dream.
But the thing is, a house may not always be a good investment. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Especially in the hottest housing markets.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Sarah Behr, a financial planner and founder of Simplify Financial in San Francisco, said she cautions even those clients who can scrape together enough to buy a home that it may not be the right investment for them.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“Housing as an asset is expensive, so if you’re not going to be somewhere for seven or eight years, it’s hard to break even and hard to know if you’ll make enough equity to offset the cost,” she said.</span> “Even if it is attainable, it’s not necessarily the best use of your money.”
There are a couple things to keep in mind when you’re considering home ownership. You may be one of the fortunate who already have the money to put <span id=""79"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 20% for</span> a down payment. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">But ask yourself: can you afford the monthly mortgage payments, or will it be hard to make ends meet?</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Have you depleted your savings entirely, putting you at risk for default if your employment situation changes?</span> And lastly, per Ms. Behr’s point, think about how long you plan on staying in this house—maybe you’re already restless and planning to move soon, in which case it might be hard to break even, especially if you factor in the considerable costs of closing on a home purchase.
<span id=""36"" class=""red"">What’s The Best Place for Financial Growth?
</span>Another achievement up for debate: living in your dream city. It might not be as dreamy as you think.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Yes, there are cool jobs in growing sectors, drawing young graduates to places like New York and San Francisco.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But housing costs in those cities are high.
</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Some make it work by living far outside the city center, where things are often cheaper, or by putting a hold on their financial goals to free up more room in the budget for pricier housing.
</span>Others leave these places altogether. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tenn., and Portland, Ore., are seeing a boom as workers leave big, pricey cities to instead work remotely in less expensive areas.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Median home prices have still risen in these cities, but owning a home is more achievable.</span> <span id=""42"" class=""red"">The median home price in Nashville, for example, <span id=""80"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $276,800 in</span> <span id=""81"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2019,</span> still lower than the national media home price <span id=""82"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $280,800,</span> according to the National Association of Realtors.
</span>If you want to get ahead in the game, think about where you want to live long term as you consider where you go to college or grad school. <span id=""43"" class=""red"">Unless you’re at a top school, the employers coming to recruit on campus might largely be regional, so pick somewhere you think you’d want to work after graduation, says Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a coaching firm.
</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">Not All the Old Rules Are Dead
Part of the generational disconnect is the idea that frugality alone will allow a responsible young professional to reach these financial goals.</span> Ditch the Sweetgreen salads and dial back the spending on your fancy coffee, the advice goes, and you’ll be able to afford that down payment in no time.
But Ms. Weeks, the Seattle attorney, already brings her lunch to work. She takes the bus. She and her husband, a leasing professional, have decided they’d rather save money than celebrate their marriage with a wedding. They do hope to take a vacation, just the two of them—something they still haven’t done since they got married <span id=""83"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span>
<span id=""45"" class=""red"">“Fifteen dollars on lunch each day, times seven—[bringing your lunch] might help a little bit, but it’s not going to make a dent in the debt that’s left,” Ms. Weeks said.</span> For her, amassing a down payment seems entirely out of reach right now.
She’s not the only one. The homeownership rate for millennials was <span id=""84"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 38% in</span><span id=""85"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> according to research from the Urban Institute, about seven percentage points lower than the rate of Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers at the same age.
“One of the expectations is you should be able to afford a house, and if you can’t, it’s seen as if you’ve missed one of the rungs you’re meant to climb up in your life,” said Rob Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
“I think for other people, they just give up and say, ‘It’s not going to happen for me.’ And I assume there’s a certain level of disappointment and a sense of failure.”
When the disappointment sets in, some people can be put off of saving or goal-setting entirely. Without advice that feels relevant, they not only give up on traditional goals, but the methods as well.
But while throwing your hands up may provide some temporary relief, it won’t cure this nagging sense of paralysis that holds so many people captive.

You still need to know your numbers—how much you make, how much you owe and how much you spend.
After confronting the numbers, determine reasonable goals and rewards: if you’re not buying a house right away, perhaps you’re contributing to an investing goal or savings account instead. Set aside a small amount of money every month. <span id=""47"" class=""red"">You can automate a monthly deposit and account for that in your budget so you don’t “miss” the money and feel crunched on cash.
</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">From there, maybe you drop your savings in a high-interest savings account, or do your research and explore the world of investing.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">The cost of putting money to work in the stock market is lower than ever, especially if you keep it simple and invest in something like a low-fee S&<span id=""86"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 index</span> fund.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">Retirement savings may not be a physical asset like a house or a car, but that pile of money is ultimately the most important financial goal to keep on your list.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">If you’re lucky enough to work for an employer that offers a 401(k) match, take advantage of it.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">If you don’t have a 401(k), consider a Roth IRA, which will allow you to take money out for emergency expenses, and a health-savings account, which will help you escape tax penalties, should you need to withdraw for a medical expense.
</span>A savings account, a 401(k) or a health-savings account aren’t tangible in the same way as a house, but they’re plus marks in your asset column. And if you feel like you have something going right, if you’re contributing in some small way to your future, you’ll feel less helpless in the long run.
There’s one more thing: Within reason, allow yourself some small joys. There’s a difference between someone who saves some money and enjoys themselves occasionally and one who saves nothing and splurges on brunch every day. <span id=""53"" class=""red"">When you’re feeling less helpless about your financial health, you can feel good about putting money toward the things that make life worth living.
</span>The goal-setting isn’t just important for young adults to understand, though; it’s important for their parents to get it, too. A more realistic, empathetic conversation between the generations can also lead to more conversations about money, period.
<span id=""54"" class=""red"">Ms. Weeks knows her parents meant well when they told her college debt was “good debt,” and they also weren’t the only ones to dole out this mistaken advice.
</span>“As you get older, you learn your parents are fallible,” she says. “I wish they’d been more upfront about how hard it was, because it feels like a moral failure when you can’t reach these milestones.”
In Which I Follow My Own Advice
I applied this advice to my own life on a recent drive with my parents back home. I knew I wanted to talk with them about how they’d seemingly so easily reached these huge goals.
When they <span id=""87"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 28,</span> my parents were already married, with a kid and a house. At the same age, after a series of too-many-roommates scenarios, I now split rent with my girlfriend, and we’re both on the same page when it comes to spending money. <span id=""55"" class=""red"">We budget together every month and we share a credit card, mostly for the convenience, but also for the points.</span> One day, we want to own a home, but for now, we’re just trying to save what we can without sacrificing the occasional dinner out. After seeing our friends drop thousands of dollars on weddings, we’ve agreed a big party like that isn’t in the cards right now.
I’ve had to redefine so many of my goals. Home ownership, as much as I dream about it, just isn’t a viable option for me right now, and like Ms. Behr suggested, I don’t know if it would make the best use of my savings, either. <span id=""56"" class=""red"">Instead, I do what I can: I have taken advantage of every 401(k) match offered (in my first job, that was <span id=""88"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 1%,</span> but I was so excited) and I contribute every month to my savings and investing accounts.</span> I want to learn more about investing and I still dream of buying a little house with a wide window seat, just like the ones I bookmark on Zillow. But for the time being, I feel comfortable just setting aside what I can.
And as my dad told me, he and my mother didn’t start “paying themselves” until much later in their marriage. <span id=""57"" class=""red"">Before then, they were too busy putting money toward their mortgage, their credit card bills and their childcare costs.</span> He said back then they simply didn’t have the cash to stash in a savings account. In that way, I’m already ahead of where they were at my age—just not in a way I expected to be.
The last time I visited my parents, we talked about my own goals. <span id=""58"" class=""red"">I want to go to graduate school one day, but I’m afraid of taking on that much debt.</span> I still want to buy a home, but a down payment feels incredibly elusive to me. My parents, to their credit, tried to understand.
They bought their first home in the 1980s: a one-bedroom starter home in Decatur, Ga. With some help from my grandfather, they came up <span id=""89"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $10,000 for</span> their first down payment (<span id=""90"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $22,200 in</span> today’s dollars).
“You know, <span id=""91"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nowadays 10% isn</span>’t enough,” I told my mother, reminding her of how she and my dad afforded their first house. Lending practices have changed. “A lot of times, you have to <span id=""92"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 20% already</span> saved for your down payment.”
She was shocked. “Who can save <span id=""93"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 20% for</span> a down payment?”

Wages climbed at a rapid pace in the year through March, a sign that labor shortages are prodding employers to increase wages to retain and attract workers — and a signal that climbing pay could keep inflation elevated, ramping up pressure on the Federal Reserve as it contemplates how much and how quickly to cool down the economy.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The central bank is trying to slow demand to a more sustainable pace at a moment when inflation is running at its fastest pace <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Officials began raising interest rates in March and have suggested that they might increase them by half a percentage point in May — twice as much as usual.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Making money more expensive to borrow and spend can slow consumption and eventually hiring, tempering wage and price growth.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Friday’s employment report probably bolsters the case for a supersized increase.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Wages have picked up <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 5.6 percent</span> over the past year, a report Friday showed, a far quicker pace than <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2 to</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 percent</span> annual pay gains that were typical during the 2010s.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">At the same time, the jobless rate fell, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3.6 percent</span> <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.8 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Unemployment is now just slightly above the half-century lows it had reached before the pandemic.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">“The year-ago wage number continues to run very strong; it sort of ends any debate about whether the unemployment rate is giving a faithful, reliable signal about the job market,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“The job market is tight.”
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">While the strong labor market has given policymakers confidence that they can slow the economy somewhat without causing an outright recession, such rapid pay gains could also perpetuate price increases by helping to sustain consumer demand and prodding companies to raise prices as they try to cover higher labor costs.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">“The promise of wages moving up is a great thing,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said after the central bank’s decision to raise interest rates last month in a bid to cool off the economy.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">But the increases are “running at levels that are well above what would be consistent <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2 percent</span> inflation, our goal, over time.”
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">With March’s figures, wages are increasing at an even faster rate over the year than they were when Mr. Powell made his remark.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Leisure and hospitality pay shot up as wages rose broadly.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Percent change in earnings for non-managers since <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2019
Quickly</span> climbing pay comes as employers compete for a finite pool of workers.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">There are <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 1.8 job</span> openings for every unemployed worker, and companies complain of struggling to hire across a range of skill sets and industries.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">“If it remains this tight, a wage-price spiral will only accelerate from here,” Mr. Feroli said.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Of the Fed, he said, “I do think they probably think it is unsustainable.”
</span>Over the past year, pay has picked up most markedly for workers in the leisure and hospitality industry, climbing <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14.9 percent</span>, while workers in transportation and warehousing have also received double-digit pay gains. Those figures are for workers who are not supervisors.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Wages climbed markedly in leisure and hospitality again last month, while pay also picked up sharply for workers in the financial and durable goods industries.
</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">While rapid wage growth is a boon for many workers, families are finding that their paychecks, while bigger, no longer buy as much as prices rise.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Pay gains are not quite keeping pace with inflation for many workers.</span>"
76325,"<h3>Tech workers had their pick of jobs for years. That era is over for now.</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Although Tiara Richardson read news articles warning of looming Big Tech layoffs, she still hoped her job as a content designer for Meta would be safe.</span> She had been with the company for four months and said, at one point, her team was considered a priority for the company.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Richardson, a 40-year-old in Raleigh, N.C., had been working remote the past four months with a team she enjoyed and just found her stride when she and <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 11,000 of</span> her colleagues lost their jobs.
</span>“I just started bawling,” she said. “I had never been in that position before. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">… I started thinking, ‘Oh my God, what if I can’t find a job?’”
Richardson joins hundreds of thousands of tech workers that are in the same boat — unexpectedly out of work and hunting for their next gig.</span> Twitter, Meta, Stripe, Lyft and most recently Salesforce and Amazon are among some of the most notable companies that have slashed their workforces.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">While many laid-off tech workers are finding job openings, they say that there are far fewer and that they’re having to combat larger numbers of top talent for new roles.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The layoffs aren’t deterring workers from the tech industry, several workers say, and they still view tech jobs as opportunities for professional growth and increased earnings.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But the cuts are making them look for roles that may offer more job security in the long run.
</span>Data shows the outlook isn’t all that gloomy, just yet. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Employers added <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 223,000 jobs</span> in December, and the unemployment rate fell to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3.5 percent</span>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The tech layoffs are not entirely a reflection of economic conditions, Rand Ghayad, head of economics and global labor markets at LinkedIn wrote in a recent blog post.</span> They are, in part, a move to return to more normal hiring.
Richardson posted on LinkedIn a month after being laid off to let her network know she was open to new opportunities. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">When she started applying for jobs in December and January, she noticed she was competing with hundreds, if not thousands, in her industry for the same positions.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">(LinkedIn shows how many candidates have applied for the position at the top of job postings.)
</span>“The competition is going to be more fierce,” she said. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">“For the jobs I have applied for, I’ve gotten more rejection notices than I had previously,” she said.
</span>Hiring in the tech, information and media industry is at its lowest level since <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2020,</span> according to LinkedIn’s member data. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 40 percent</span> of LinkedIn members in the industry who hopped jobs in November stayed in the industry.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Others have left for the professional services, like legal or accounting firms, or financial services industries.</span> The wait for tech workers to get their next gig may not be long, according to October data from ZipRecruiter. <span id=""13"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 37 percent</span> of surveyed laid-off tech workers found a new job within one month, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 79 percent</span> were employed within three months.
</span>For Meagan Moakes, getting laid off was unfortunately a familiar experience, but this instance may have come at the worst timing as her husband was laid off two days prior. Moakes, a 37-year-old Dallas resident, has been laid off four times in her career.
“By the fourth time, you’re kind of numb to it,” Moakes said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">“We went from a two-income family to a one-income family to a no-income family <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">within 48 hours</span>.”
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Moakes said her plight has vastly contrasted that of her husband, who seems to be more in demand as a video game developer.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But as someone who has worked in customer relationship roles for big and small tech companies, she’s applying for jobs that often have anywhere <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 350 to</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,600 other</span> candidates, many from Big Tech companies, she said.</span> As a result, she’s starting to doubt her own skills and accomplishments.
“I feel like I’m lost in a sea of numbers,” she said.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Vahan Terterian has applied to at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 150 positions</span> since he lost his job in December, but only a handful have responded with interest.</span> The 26-year-old Denver resident was most recently a product manager at rental tech company Nomad, where he worked for seven months before cuts hit.
“I had a sinking feeling in my chest,” he recalls thinking about the upcoming layoffs.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">After taking a few days to recover from the shock of losing his job, Terterian said he, too, started to realize how many people he’s up against for current openings — a much different reality than when he landed his job in May.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The market is flooded with high-quality talent,” he said.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">“So it seems slower than when I first got this job in May.</span> It was booming [back then].”
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Terterian said he’s asking hiring employers more specific questions about their financial stability, hiring and outlook to avoid another layoff.
</span>For 36-year-old Amber Adamson, the strategy is to beef up her coding skills to make her more hirable in tech. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Adamson, a Norristown, Penn., resident who’s been transitioning out of her teaching role, started her first technical job as a junior email developer for veterinarian services company Covetrus in June but was laid off in September.
</span>She says the barriers are plentiful for new entrants into the industry. First, prerequisites often require years of experience for entry-level positions, she says. Then there are the hundreds of qualified candidates she’s competing against. She’s seeing more and more laid-off workers from Big Tech companies post that they’re available for hire.
“I’m hoping to make myself more desirable for recruiters, so they’ll reach out to me,” she said. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">“You really have to be prepared to sell yourself because the market is saturated.”
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">Some workers are finding that the best path to a new job is through their professional network.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Charell Star, a former lead of brand media, social media and partnerships at Meta’s payments business who’s worked in marketing for the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">last 20 years</span>, was also part of Meta’s November layoffs after working for the company for more than two years.
</span>The Maplewood, N.J., resident was four months into her five-month maternity leave. It was the second layoff in her career.
Star said the best leads are coming through connections who either heard about her layoff or saw her LinkedIn post announcing it. <span id=""26"" class=""red"">She’s getting tips on jobs that haven’t been posted or roles that have yet to be created, and some of her employed connections are rerouting recruiters to her.</span> So while the layoffs may be increasing competition, they’re also creating a sense of community, she says.
“There is a camaraderie of us going through this together,” she said. “I recommend people start networking and reaching out to old contacts … you never know where an opportunity will come from.”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">Richardson, the former content designer at Meta, said she’s getting creative in her job search.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">With a background in fashion and interests in media, fashion, retail, entertainment and tech, she’s contacting her big dream jobs.</span> How big? She said she’s contacted the head of human resources at Parkwood Entertainment and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s company, and approached the Obama Foundation.
“My advice is to keep a positive mind-set, and don’t be afraid to shoot your shot,” she said.
<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Five quick tips for job seekers
- Include a summary: All professional profiles and résumés should have a summary at the very top that highlight a job seeker’s most marketable skills and give employers a sense of their personality.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">This is even more important for candidates who may not have direct job experience for the position to which they are applying.
- Use keywords: Professional profiles, especially those online, should have keywords sprinkled throughout to help the candidate get past the computer systems that may be reviewing their résumé first.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Experts say job seekers should research the most common qualities and skills needed for the job and include them, if applicable.
- Highlight accomplishments: Job seekers should refrain from relying on job descriptions to explain their previous experience.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Instead, they should highlight their accomplishments with as many specifics as possible.
- Connect with professionals online: Candidates’ professional networks can often lead to the next job.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Experts say job seekers should be contacting people they know within the industries that interest them.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">But they also should be asking for introductions to people whom their friends, family and colleagues may know, as well as messaging people with whom they have no connection at all.
- Post on social media: To increase the chances of getting hired, experts say job seekers would be wise to post on their personal social networks to let people know they’re looking for a job and provide specifics about what they hope to find.

86518,"<h3>Here’s Why the Fed Will Stay Central to Markets</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">Returning to a precrisis playbook risks disruptions

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 12</span>:15 pm ET

Federal Reserve officials grappling with the legacy of expansive stimulus would find it difficult to return to the central bank’s precrisis role on the sidelines of financial markets, analysts and central-bank watchers say.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">A long list of programs adopted to help foster economic growth, along with changes in money markets and bank regulation, have vastly expanded the Fed’s balance sheet and its involvement in markets.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed’s assets now <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">total $4.5 trillion</span>, up from less <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1 trillion</span> a decade ago.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2013 the</span> central bank has become one of the largest traders with U.S. taxable money-market funds, according to Crane Data.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Many analysts and investors worry that significantly rolling back the Fed’s expansion, a course advocated by some in conservative circles, risks disrupting markets and the economy at a time when growth remains tepid.</span> It would also reduce the connections the institution has built with a diverse set of Wall Street firms, beyond the group of banks it dealt with before the crisis.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Fed has become “like an octopus,” said Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles money manager.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“Once you get the power and you are influencing all these markets, do you really want to retreat from all that?”

Investors are already assessing how stocks and bonds might react, when the central bank begins the latest stage of its yearslong retreat from stimulus—likely later this year—by ending the practice of reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds into new bonds.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed is scheduled to publish Wednesday the minutes of its latest policy meeting, where officials may have continued their debate over the mix of policy tools they plan to use in the future.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials say they are attracted to maintaining parts of their current approach.</span> Minutes of their November meeting also showed officials discussing the advantages of keeping something similar to the existing system in place, in part because it is simpler to operate than the precrisis one.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The Fed hasn’t decided the issue, but its choices will be closely watched because its leadership is in transition.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">President Donald Trump is preparing to fill three vacancies on the Fed’s seven-member board.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The White House hasn’t named its picks, but its choices could set Fed policy in new directions, including by limiting its role in markets.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Republican lawmakers have also revived legislation to subject its decisions to greater public scrutiny, and some want monetary policy conducted by preset rules.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“It’s not your father’s Fed,” said Adam Gilbert, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and a former New York Fed official.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Changes could herald “incoming policy makers who are by nature skeptical of a Fed that continues unorthodox approaches to both monetary and regulatory policy.”

New York Fed President William Dudley told an audience this month the portfolio isn’t likely to return to its precrisis size.</span> Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said this month the portfolio would be “significantly smaller” than it is today, but likely <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above $2 trillion</span> in assets.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The ultimate size will be closely tied to which system the central bank decides to use to control interest rates in the future.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A handful of Fed officials have already begun questioning the wisdom of returning to the blueprint for controlling rates that they used before the crisis, although they have more time to decide.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">At the center of the debate is a special investment program the Fed launched <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013.</span></span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Through the facility, it lends money-market funds and others Treasurys in exchange for cash, temporarily draining excess cash from money markets and discouraging lenders from lending at rates below the target range for interest rates.

</span>Initially, the central bank said it would reduce the capacity of this so-called reverse repo facility “fairly soon after” it had begun raising short-term rates <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Today, the Fed has no current plans to do so.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. Dudley suggested in April the Fed likely wouldn’t phase out the facility.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Without the Fed repos, short-term rates could slip too low, and demand for Treasurys in the open market would surge, causing problems for money-market funds seeking alternative places to park cash overnight.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Removing the program would “cause huge dislocations from a bond-market standpoint,” said Debbie Cunningham, chief investment officer for global money markets at Federated Investors.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">A balance sheet that is smaller than today’s, yet still substantial, would enable the Fed to keep the reverse repos around.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">It would also support the Fed’s foreign repos for overseas accounts, where weekly balances have <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">averaged $250 billion</span>, up <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $30 billion</span> precrisis, as well as <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1.5 trillion</span> in currency outstanding and changing cash-management policies at the Treasury Department.

</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">If the Fed reduces its bond portfolio, the burden will be on private market participants to step in.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2018,</span> Morgan Stanley calculates investors may have to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">absorb $400 billion</span> in mortgage bonds alone, a level not seen <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span></span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In the past, such transitions were smoothed by the banks authorized to trade opposite the Fed, called primary dealers.</span> Now those firms are grappling with new leverage rules, and some have less capacity.

Communicating a strategy for unwinding risks some unintended signals. <span id=""28"" class=""red""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> when the Fed surprised investors with talk of slowing bond purchases, financial markets convulsed, thinking the Fed meant earlier rate rises than were expected.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The Fed is wary of destabilizing the Treasury market, in particular, because of increasing lurches driven by algorithmic trading.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">To avoid market disruptions, former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote in a recent blog post for the Brookings Institution, “There’s no need to rush.”

A soldier, call sign Petrovich, stands in a trench on the Kherson frontline on Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8.</span> Efforts by Ukrainian forces to recapture seized territory have slowed. (Wojciech Grzedzinski/For The Washington Post)

MYKOLAIV REGION, Ukraine — On the front line in southeast Ukraine, there is little sign that a major counteroffensive is brewing.

For weeks, Western intelligence and military analysts have predicted that a Ukrainian campaign to retake the strategic port city of Kherson and surrounding territory is imminent. But in trenches less than a mile from Russia’s positions in the area, Ukrainian soldiers hunker down from an escalating onslaught of artillery, with little ability to advance.

“It’s to our left side, our right side, over our heads,” said Yuri, a 45-year-old soldier with the Ukrainian military’s 63rd Mechanized Brigade, said of the incoming fire, which has intensified over the past week. At night, Russian forces make reconnaissance missions that probe the tenuously held farmland. “It’s a more tense situation,” he said.

Retaking Kherson would mark a devastating blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">The wider region is crucial to providing fresh water to Crimea, a problem that has cost Russia billions of rubles since its illegal annexation of the peninsula <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span></span> It is also a key foothold for any future Russian military push in the south toward Odessa, the coveted jewel on the Black Sea.

But time is slipping if Ukraine is to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky’s stated goal of winning the war by the end of the year, and the current situation on the ground raises the prospect of a long, grinding stalemate instead. Residents who have fled villages in the Kherson region have described Russian forces moving in reinforcements, and officials have eyed those troop movements warily.

“They’ve dug in,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, after returning from a trip to inspect the front lines on Sunday. “We know that they are trying to fortify their positions. The enemy has significantly increased its artillery along the entire line,” he said of the 60-mile-long front line, after returning from visiting positions on Sunday.

Lacking the basic artillery and armored vehicles needed to progress, Ukraine has focused on operations far behind the front lines. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That includes a mysterious attack earlier this week on a Russian air base in Crimea, a major supply hub for Russian operations in Kherson previously assumed to be out of its enemy’s reach.

</span>The progress Ukrainian forces had made here in recent months — recapturing a string of villages from Russia’s control — has largely stalled, with soldiers exposed in the open terrain.

The roads that soldiers zip along among the scorched wheat fields at the front lines are pockmarked with craters from previous strikes, guided by Russia’s Orlan drones that allow them to pick and choose targets.

“There is nowhere to hide,” said Yuri, who has fought here without a break since the beginning of the war, and like other soldiers did not give his last name, in line with protocol. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">His unit has a hodgepodge stock: modern antitank weapons and a Soviet machine gun manufactured <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1944,</span> and the focus here is holding the line.

</span>Ukrainian military officials are tight-lipped on any timeline for a wider push, but say they need more supplies of Western weapons before one can happen. Ukraine lacks the capacity to launch a full-scale offensive anywhere along <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,200</span>-mile front line, one security official conceded.

“We have to be honest — for now, Ukraine doesn’t have a sufficient number of weapons systems for a counteroffensive,” said a defense and intelligence adviser to the Ukrainian government who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

“It’s still possible to get a result, but if so it will be the result of smart Ukraine strategy more than of countering Russia with equal power,” the adviser said. “It’s very difficult to match them.”

In an interview this week, Maj. Gen. Dmytro Marchenko, Ukrainian army commander, also said “small batches” of Western military aid means carrying out offensive actions is “very difficult” but expressed optimism that the dynamic would change soon.

“I think once we get the full package of this aid, our counteroffensive will be very quick,” he told RBC newspaper, urging people of Kherson to be “a little patient.”

“It will not be as long as everyone expects,” Marchenko added.

Others have appeared to temper expectations, stressing that the situation is dynamic. In recent days, Russia has launched a new assault on cities in Ukraine’s east.

“It changes pretty much every day because the enemy moves their forces and we change our tactics and maneuvers,” said Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the defense minister. “Things change and plans change.”

The counteroffensive “is already happening” in the way that is feasible, said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s Southern Command, adding that progress will be “little by little” and pointing out that the conflict is a “hybrid war.”

Some have even hinted that the offensive here may have been trumpeted as part of a campaign of informational warfare, designed to draw Russian firepower away from areas farther east.

And Russia has been reinforcing. <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 3,000 troops</span> have arrived in the Kherson region over the past week alone, bringing to at <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 15,000 the</span> number of Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnieper River, the intelligence adviser said.

Most of them are elite airborne troops who are helping to bolster exhausted Russian forces who have been manning the front line for months, said Kirill Mikhailov, a Kyiv-based analyst with the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian research and investigative group.

Fleeing residents describe Russian troops as hunkering down.

“Two weeks ago they came in with big equipment,” said one 42-year-old from Novovorontsovka, near Kherson, who is in touch with parents there. “They are setting up bases in houses.” A 65-year-old who left the tiny village of Mar’ine on <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 11 said</span> Russian forces who had barely been visible earlier in its occupation began moving in large numbers in the days before she fled. “They were digging in trenches,” she said.

The troop movements have raised concerns that Russia could be preparing its own new offensive in the area. But while Russia may try to recover some of the villages retaken by Ukrainian troops in recent months, they also lack the means to launch a large-scale operation, analysts and officials say.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The forces around Kherson city constitute Russia’s only foothold on that side of the river, a natural defensive barrier that carves through Ukraine and requires supply routes to pass through several highly vulnerable chokeholds.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Those supply routes have proven vulnerable to Ukraine’s new U.S.-supplied HIMAR rocket systems.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">And with its strike on Crimea, Ukraine has demonstrated the capacity to hit the heart of Russian military installations in the major military supply hub for Moscow’s operations in the south.

</span>But if Ukraine is to conduct a counteroffensive “the clock is ticking,” Mikhailov said. It’s going to be the muddy season by October, making military movements difficult.

Outgunned, Ukraine is also using hybrid tactics. In the city, much of the local population is hostile to occupation, said Konstantin Ryzhenko, a Ukrainian journalist in hiding there. Russian soldiers are already not visible on the streets of the city in fear of attacks, he said.

Those who remain, including officers from Russia’s FSB intelligence service and police, have moved their bases to civilian locations under hospitals and in urban areas, in fear of HIMAR strikes, Ryzhenko said.

“It just takes one of them to turn around for five seconds for them to be distracted, for them to be hung up and drowned,” he said of Russian troops. In late June, a senior Russian appointed official in the city was killed in a bomb blast.

Given the strike in Crimea, Russia’s hold over Kherson is in jeopardy, said Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank.

“I think the Russians will pull out of Kherson soon,” he said. “It’s becoming untenable — really hard to resupply forces.”

That would stymie any Russian goal, however unrealistic, to take all of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and create a connection to the Russian-controlled territory of Transnistria in Moldova. And others point to Russia’s willingness to sacrifice its soldiers even for operations that don’t make strategic sense, while Ukraine typically moves forward only with caution.

“The Ukraine army will never do anything stupid, like Russia, throwing people like cannon fodder into battle to satisfy the ambitions of their leaders,” Sak said. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">“The question is the price.”

</span>Russia is less militarily vulnerable in areas of Kherson province that lie on the eastern banks of the Dnieper River. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">That territory is essential to Putin’s long-sought “land bridge” to Crimea and its fresh water supply.

</span>In the first days following the invasion, Russian forces blew up a dam in a canal in the region that had long infuriated Putin. Ukraine dammed the waterway <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014 following</span> Russia’s occupation of the peninsula. Once-fertile farmland turned into parched barren flats, and the Kremlin was forced to pay out billions in subsidies and to invest in new water projects.

It’s a region Putin is unlikely to relinquish without a ferocious fight.

Although Ukraine has enough manpower to launch a push, Sak said that without more sophisticated weaponry there is a risk of sending troops needlessly to their deaths in an offensive with marginal chances of success.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some Ukrainian military units are already paying a price.</span> For nearly six months, Ukraine’s 28th Mechanized Brigade has fought along the southern front, stopping a lightning advance by Russian forces outside the city of Mykolaiv.

The unit’s battle-hardened fighters continue to claw back territory as they inch closer to Kherson. Despite being some of the best equipped and most professionally trained units on the front lines, withering Russian artillery strikes across the open steppe have maimed and killed many of their fighters.

In late July, the 28th Mechanized Brigade’s commander, Vitalii Huliaiev, was killed in action and his fellow soldiers intend to avenge his death.

“We will get to Kherson,” said a battalion commander for the unit who goes by the call sign Zloi, which translates as Angry or Mean. “We will have our revenge.”

47642,"<h3>New CEO Wants to Make Barnes & Noble Your Local Bookstore</h3>Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 6</span>:00 am ET

LONDON—Barnes & Noble Inc.’s new chief executive wants to run America’s largest bookstore chain more like a collection <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 627 independent</span> stores.

James Daunt, who also leads Britain’s largest bookstore chain, Waterstones, on Wednesday became Barnes & Noble’s fifth permanent chief executive in six years after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. closed its deal to buy the company.

The New York-based chain long worked to give its locations a similar look, feel and inventory, but readers shunned the stores in recent years.

Mr. Daunt plans to reinvigorate the U.S. book giant by applying a playbook that has worked well in the U.K.: Giving individual stores the autonomy to buy and promote books they bet will resonate with the local clientele.

“Barnes & Noble is what Waterstones used to be. They run identical bookshops up and down the country,” said Mr. Daunt. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“You should do what you want; there are no restrictions on what books you stock, how you display them, what you promote.</span> Each bookshop is quite individual.”

The 55-year-old Briton, who led Waterstones out of a difficult period earlier this decade and will remain its CEO, is widely respected in the book industry.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">“His sensibilities about our business are excellent and I think Barnes & Noble having him attempting to turn the ship around is as good news as anyone could have asked for,” said Oren Teicher, head of the American Booksellers Association.

</span>But Barnes & Noble has twice as many stores as Waterstones. Many are larger and in less desirable locations, like suburban strip malls rather than busy shopping streets.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">“Barnes & Noble stores are too big to be filled with assortments of local relevance and be economically viable,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.

</span>The new CEO, who will relocate to New York, will have to woo Americans who are reading less. The percentage of U.S. adults who said they had read a book in any format over the <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past 12 months</span> dropped <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 74% last</span> year <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 79% in</span><span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> according to Pew Research Center.

Mr. Daunt—who started his career as an investment banker—opened his first bookstore in London <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1990,</span> at the age <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 26.</span> He named it Daunt Books and opened a further eight stores, all of which exist today and remain independent.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> Mr. Daunt was hired to stem sliding sales at Waterstones by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut who bought the British chain for £53 million from HMV Group PLC.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Revenue deteriorated for three more years, hurt by competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle.</span> Mr. Daunt decentralized decision making and refurbished stores. He closed the head office, and moved some managers to space above the flagship store in London’s Piccadilly Circus and others to regional locations close to clusters of stores.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">For <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2018,</span> Waterstones reported an underlying profit of £16.32 million across <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 278 shops</span>, compared with a loss of £42.91 million <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2012 from</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 286 stores</span>.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Sales at the Piccadilly store are on track to hit £14 million this year, up from below £8 million in<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011,</span> said Mr. Daunt.

Elliott, which bought Waterstones <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018,</span> decided to buy Barnes & Noble after Mr. Daunt convinced executives his strategy could translate to the larger chain, according to a person familiar with the matter.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The hedge fund took comfort in the stabilizing market for physical books.</span> It plans to expand the chain’s footprint by opening smaller stores in high-traffic locations like city centers, the person said.

Mr. Daunt—who describes the U.S. as “extraordinarily underbookshopped”—says he doesn’t expect to close many stores. He will first look to renegotiate <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 20% of</span> leases that end each year to ensure stores are profitable.

<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 80% of</span> Barnes & Noble’s books are bought and allocated by its head office, while all promotions are decided centrally, according to Mr. Daunt and publishing executives.

Publishers pay tens of thousands of dollars for chain bookstores to display their new books on promotional tables for a few weeks.

That means shoppers at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan will see the same titles on display as visitors to a branch at a mall in Idaho Falls. Books that don’t sell are sent back to publishers.

Mr. Daunt stopped accepting placement payments from publishers for Waterstones, which he said decreased the share of books stores sent back <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% from</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25%.</span> He is aiming for a similar reduction at Barnes & Noble.

“You need to try to put the right books in the right places and it requires you to trust the local people to make the right decisions,” he said.

At Waterstones, central buyers send stores limited copies of books they think will work at a given location but further orders are made by local buyers, with input from store staff. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Stores are sent a daily compilation of reviews and upcoming media appearances, while booksellers are encouraged to trade tips with neighboring stores.

</span>“You get lots of information but no instruction,” said Mr. Daunt. “It’s the opposite at Barnes & Noble.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Brian Murray, CEO of HarperCollins Publishers, said American book sales are more media-driven than British ones.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">That, he said, could leave Barnes & Noble stores that prioritize local input vulnerable to a shortage of books for which there is national demand, sending customers into Amazon’s arms.

</span>“James has the experience, he knows in his gut how to be a bookseller,” he said. “He has to quickly learn how the U.S. is different to the U.K. and figure out how to execute on his vision.”

HarperCollins Publishers is a unit of The Wall Street Journal’s parent company, News Corp.

On a recent morning at the Piccadilly Circus Waterstones, Europe’s largest bookstore <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 50,000 square</span> feet, a sign described books piled on a table near the cash register as “devastating masterpieces.”

Stuart Collie and other staff came up with the theme and decided what books to include. Mr. Collie proudly pointed to a table piled with William Boyd’s “Love is Blind” and another featuring “There There” by Tommy Orange, both authors he decided to promote.

“It’s a really nice feeling when a book sells because of you,” he said.

34811,"<h3>Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus at CPAC: ‘If the Party and the Conservative Movement Are Together, It Can’t Be Stopped’</h3>American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp hosted a conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House strategist Steve Bannon on Thursday at <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CPAC 2017.</span>
Priebus began by declaring that President Trump, who will also speak at CPAC, would become known as “one of the greatest presidents that ever served this country.”
Schlapp noted that Trump will also be the first president to address CPAC during his first year in office since Ronald Reagan <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981,</span> and he congratulated Trump for assembling “the most conservative Cabinet we’ve ever seen, according to our CPAC ratings.”
When Schlapp asked for the “biggest misconception about what’s going on in the Donald Trump White House,” Priebus replied: “In regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you’re reading.”
Priebus and Bannon said that contrary to media reports about friction between them, they’re working very well together.
“It’s actually something that you all helped build,” Priebus told the audience. “When you bring together, and what this election showed, and what President Trump showed — and let’s not kid ourselves, I mean I can talk about data and ground game, and Steve can talk about big ideas, but the truth of the matter is, Donald Trump, President Trump brought together the party and the conservative movement.”
The President’s chief of staff went on to say, prompting a burst of applause:
And I’ve got to tell you, if the party and the conservative movement are together — similar to Steve and I — it can’t be stopped. And President Trump was the one guy, he was the one person — and I can say it after <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">overseeing 16 people</span> kill each other — it was Donald Trump that was able to bring this party and this movement together. Steve and I know that, and we live it every day. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Our job is to get the agenda of President Trump through the door, and on pen and paper.
</span>Bannon, formerly a Breitbart News executive, argued that the mainstream media has been consistently wrong in how it portrayed the Trump campaign, the transition, and now the administration during its first months.
“If you remember, the campaign was the most chaotic, by the media’s description, most chaotic, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no earthly idea what they were doing — and then you saw them all crying and weeping that night on the Eighth,” he recalled.
Bannon agreed with Priebus that President Trump’s ideas, energy, and vision were the key to galvanizing a broad coalition of supporters around him.
“A lot of people have strong beliefs about different things, but we understand that you can come together to win, and we understood that from August 15th,” Bannon said. “We never had a doubt, and Donald Trump never had a doubt that he was going to win.”
Priebus and Bannon both emphasized how much of Trump’s agenda is clearly laid out in his speeches, going all the way back to his appearance at <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">CPAC 2011.</span>
“What all of us were starving for the whole time, because we’re so sick of politics and politicians — in spite of the fact that we love being here, we actually hate politics — but what we were starving for was somebody real,” Priebus contended. “Somebody genuine, somebody that was actually who he said he was.”
“If you want to see the Trump agenda, it’s very simple: it was all in the speeches,” said Bannon. “He went around to these rallies with those speeches that had a tremendous amount of content in them. I happen to believe, and I think many others do, he’s probably the greatest public speaker in those large arenas since William Jennings Bryan.”
“Remember, we didn’t have any money,” Bannon pointed out. “Hillary Clinton and these guys had <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $2 billion</span>. We had a couple of hundred million dollars. It was those rallies and those speeches. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">All he’s doing right now is he’s laid out an agenda with those speeches, to the promises he made, and our job every day is just to execute on that, to simply get a path to how those get executed.”
</span>Bannon testified that President Trump’s response to advice that he should deviate from his agenda for short-term political benefit has been, “No, I promised the American people this, and this is the plan we’re going to execute on.”
“That’s why you’ve seen the executive orders, the way he’s gone through the Supreme Court, and by the way the <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">other 102 judges</span> that we’re eventually going to pick,” he said.
“It’s just methodical, and that’s what the mainstream media won’t report. Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign, and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what’s going on today, because we have a team that’s just grinding it through on what President Donald Trump promised the American people. The mainstream media had better understand something: all of those promises are going to be implemented,” Bannon promised.
Priebus said the most urgent task for the administration was confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He explained:
Number One, we’re not talking about a change over a four-year period. We’re talking about a change of potentially forty years of law. But more important than that, it established trust. It established that President Trump is a man of his word. We always knew that. But when he said here’s twenty names on a piece of paper back in July, remember, and he said, ‘I’m going to pick my judge out of these twenty people that are on this piece of paper,’ and he did it — that’s number one, because Neil Gorsuch represents a conservative, represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump, and it fulfills the promise that he made to all of you, and to all Americans across the country.
Priebus said the second item on the president’s agenda was deregulation. He argued that Trump hasn’t been given enough credit for imposing a consistent process of deregulation by ordering that “for every regulation presented for passage, that Cabinet secretary has to identify two that that person would eliminate.”
The third priority identified by Priebus was immigration — “protecting the sovereignty of the United States, putting a wall on the southern border, making sure that criminals are not part of our process.”
“These are all things that eight percent of Americans agree with, and these are all things that President Trump is doing within thirty days,” he declared.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Bannon divided the White House agenda into three categories: national security, economic nationalism, and the deconstruction of the administrative state.</span> He said:
I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdrawal from TPP. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The people in the mainstream media don’t get this, but we’re already working in consultation with the Hill, people are starting to think through a whole raft of amazing and innovative bilateral relationships, bilateral trading relationships with people that will reposition America in the world as a fair trading nation, and start to bring jobs — high value added manufacturing jobs — back to the United States of America.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“The rule of law is going to exist, when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration,” he stated, linking the president’s trade positions with national security.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">He said the defense budget and Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s plan for defeating ISIS would also be part of that imperative.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Bannon made the interesting point that business leaders have been telling the White House that slashing regulations is at least as important as cutting taxes to get the economy moving faster.
</span>“If you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason, and that is the deconstruction — the way the progressive left runs is that if they can’t get it passed, they’re just going to put it in some kind of regulation in an agency. That’s all going to be deconstructed, and that’s why I think this regulatory thing is so important,” he said.
Schlapp brought the conversation back to media coverage of the new administration. Priebus said he thought there was hope for improvement.
“I”m personally so conditioned to hearing about why President Trump isn’t going to win the election, why a controversy in the primary is going to take down President Trump; I lived through it as chairman of the party,” he said, recalling his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee during <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 election</span>.
“It really hit me because it was maybe the summer <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015,</span> and you remember the media was constantly pounding President Trump, and the polling kept getting better and better for President Trump. But it was when I went home and got out of this town, and I went back to Kenosha, and I talked to my neighbor. And I said, ‘Bob, what do you think?’ He goes, ‘Man, I really love that Trump.’ I said, ‘Sandy, what do you think?’ ‘We’re for Trump.’”
“You all lived through it too, because you all had different people you were for, but you kept running into your neighbors, and you kept running into people that you know, and what did they keep telling you? They kept telling you, ‘Trump, Trump, Trump,’” he said, unintentionally sparking a chant of the president’s name from the audience. He said it was clear the country was hungry for something much bigger than a single issue campaign, or a modest course correction from the previous administration.
Bannon took his turn at the microphone to disagree with Priebus about whether media coverage of the Trump administration would improve. He argued that it was likely to get worse.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">“They’re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,” Bannon argued, recalling how that message resonated everywhere from previous CPAC appearances by Trump to small town hall meetings.
</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">He predicted media coverage would therefore get worse as Trump continues to “press his agenda, and as economic conditions get better, more jobs get better, they’re going to continue to fight.”</span> Bannon warned:
If you think they’re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. Every day it is going to be a fight, and that is what I’m proudest about Donald Trump. All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to moderate.’ Every day in the Oval Office he tells Reince and I, ‘I commited this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I’m going to deliver on this.’
Priebus stressed the importance of Republicans sticking together through the coming years.
“I think what you’ve got is an incredible opportunity to use this victory that President Trump and all of us, and you, and everyone that made this happen put together, and work together, continue to communicate,” he said, adding:
Some of the core principles of President Trump are very similar to those of Ronald Reagan. When you look at peace through strength and building up the military — I mean, how many times have you heard President Trump say, ‘I’m going to build up the military, I’m going to take care of the vets, I’m going to make sure that we don’t have a Navy that’s decimated and planes that are nowhere to be found?’ Peace through strength. Deregulation. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">You think about the economy and the economic boom that was created.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Some of it is going to take a little time — to get the jobs back, to get more money in people’s pockets.</span> Those things are going to happen. In the meantime, we have to stick together and make sure that we’ve got President Trump for eight years. He’s somebody that we know that we’re going to be very proud of as these things get done. But it’s going to take all of us working together to make it happen.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bannon saw a “new political order” continuing to take shape, noting that populists, limited-government conservatives, libertarians, and economic nationalists could be found in the CPAC audience.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“We have wide and sometimes divergent opinions, but I think the center core of what we believe — that we’re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being,” he said.</span> “I think that’s what unites us, and I think that is what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”
“We’re at the top of the first inning on this. It’s going to take just as much fight, just as much focus, and just as much determination, and the one thing I’d like to leave you guys today with is that we want you to have our back … but more importantly, hold us accountable. Hold us accountable to what we promised, hold us accountable for delivering on what we promised.”
Modertor Matt Schlapp, in acknowledgment of the unique nature of their joint appearance, asked the Honorable Gentlemen what they appreciated about one another.
Priebus lauded Bannon for being “very dogged in ensuring that every day, the promises that President Trump has made are the promises that we’re working on,” for being “incredibly loyal,” and for being “extremely consistent.”
“As you can imagine, there are many things hitting the president’s ear and desk every day, different things that come to the president that want to move him off his agenda, and Steve is very consistent and very loyal to the agenda, and is a presence that I think is very important to have in the White House,” he said. He added that he thought of Bannon as a dear and cherished friend.
“I can run a little hot on occasions,” Bannon allowed. “And Reince is indefatigable. It’s low key, but it’s determination. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The thing I respect most, and the only way this thing works, is Reince is always kind of steady … his job is by far one of the toughest jobs I’ve ever seen in my life.”

92586,"<h3>First Futures Contract to Pay Out in Bitcoin Poised for Green Light</h3>Intercontinental Exchange project is aimed at institutional investors wary of murky cryptocurrency markets

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:30 am ET

WASHINGTON—The first futures contract that will pay out in cryptocurrency rather than cash is expected to soon get regulatory approval.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The contract, launched by New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE -1.13%decrease; red down pointing triangle is aimed at institutional players who have stayed out of cryptocurrency markets out of concerns that they are unregulated and susceptible to manipulation.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Bitcoin futures allow investors to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency.</span> Other bitcoin-futures contracts exist but they pay out in dollars.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The effort has received backing from major corporations such as Microsoft Corp. and Starbucks Corp., which have the longer-term goal of making cryptocurrency transparent and regulated enough to allow customers to use it for retail purchases, such as a Starbucks latte.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Once digital assets have more trust and regulation, people will be more comfortable using digital assets as currency,” said Kelly Loeffler, chief executive of the ICE cryptocurrency business, dubbed Bakkt (pronounced “backed”).

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Following an extraordinary run-up in bitcoin prices last year, CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange company, and Cboe Global Markets Inc., operator of the biggest U.S. options exchange, both launched futures on the cryptocurrency in December.

</span>Since then, the outlook for the cryptocurrency has dimmed considerably. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">After peaking <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $20,000 last</span> December, bitcoin’s price has dropped by <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 80%.</span></span> Federal regulators are investigating possible manipulation in bitcoin markets, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

The CME and Cboe futures contracts were seen as a big step forward for the once-fringe asset gaining wider acceptance on Wall Street. Both of those contracts settle in cash, meaning that owners receive U.S. dollars rather than bitcoin when the futures contract ends.

“It’s great to have cash-settled, but there’s a need for physical delivery” of bitcoin, Ms. Loeffler said.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">ICE has been working with regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the past several months to make sure its business plan complies with CFTC regulations.</span> The project will require an exemption from the agency to allow it to hold on to customers’ bitcoins, since CFTC statutes are written to account for cash, securities, and agricultural commodities such as wheat or coffee.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">ICE and regulators also had to sort out major cybersecurity issues, both in terms of preventing attacks and the financial liability for lost assets if a hack occurs.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">CFTC staff is currently reviewing ICE’s business plan.</span> CFTC commissioners will likely vote on whether to approve the project early <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019,</span> after which the public will <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 30 days</span> to weigh in.

Bakkt is not ICE’s first foray into cryptocurrencies. The exchange giant has an investment in Coinbase, a San Francisco-based provider of “wallet” services that is one of the leading cryptocurrency businesses. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In January, ICE also announced it was teaming up with startup Blockstream to start a service that would bring bitcoin data to hedge funds and other professional trading firms.

68468,"<h3>Kushner arrives at Senate for closed-door questioning on Russia</h3>Jared Kushner, President Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, walked into Senate offices Monday morning to begin answering questions behind closed doors about his contacts with Russian officials.
In written remarks made public prior to his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Kushner denies any improper contacts or collusion. The 11-page statement by Kushner details four meetings he had with Russian officials during <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span> and transition period — including one set up by Donald Trump Jr. with a Russian lawyer.
Kushner defends his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and other Russian officials as typical contacts in his role as the Trump campaign’s liaison to foreign governments, according to the prepared statement he plans to submit for the record.
Kushner is answering questions behind closed doors, first to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday and then again on Tuesday to the House Intelligence Committee. Both panels are probing Russian interference in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 election</span> and contacts between Russia and Trump campaign officials and associates.
[Read Kushner’s prepared statement]
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government orchestrated a far-reaching campaign to meddle with last year’s presidential campaign and influence the outcome in Trump’s favor.
Kushner’s appearances before congressional committees mark a new phase in the investigations of Russian meddling, as he is the first of the president’s closest advisers to appear before them.
In his testimony, which will be submitted to the congressional committees before he answers questions from lawmakers, Kushner says he has had only “limited contacts” with Russian representatives and denies any wrongdoing.
“I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Kushner writes. “I had no improper contacts. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector.”
</span>Kushner portrays himself as a goal-oriented task master new to presidential politics who assumed increasingly important responsibilities on a fast-paced campaign in which decisions were made “on the fly,” including serving as the main point of contact for foreign government officials.
Kushner writes that his first meeting with a Russian official was in <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2016 at</span> the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Trump delivered a major foreign policy speech, the execution of which Kushner says he oversaw. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Kushner writes that he attended a reception to thank the event’s host, Dimitri Simes, publisher of the National Interest, a foreign policy magazine.</span> Simes introduced Kushner to four ambassadors at the reception, including Kislyak, Kushner says.
“With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy,” Kushner writes. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies.</span> I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.”
Kushner does not name the other three ambassadors he met at the reception.
Kushner denies having had any other contact with Kislyak during the campaign, disputing a report by Reuters that he had two phone calls with the ambassador.
“While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador,” Kushner writes. “We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place.”
In fact, Kushner goes on to note that on Nov.<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span> the day after the election, when the campaign received a congratulatory note from Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kushner tried to verify it was real and could not remember Kislyak’s name. “So I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, ‘What is the name of the Russian ambassador?’ ” Kushner writes.
Kushner also describes attending a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2016 meeting</span> organized by his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr., with a Russian attorney. He says it was listed on his calendar as “Meeting: Don Jr. | Jared Kushner.” He writes that he arrived at the meeting late, and when he got there the Russian lawyer was talking about a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.
“I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting,” Kushner writes. “Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 10 or</span> so minutes and wrote, ‘Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.’ <span id=""4"" class=""red"">”
Kushner writes that he received a “random email” on Oct.<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30,</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> from a screen name “Guccifer400,” which he interpreted as “a hoax” that was “an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">him 52 bitcoins</span> in exchange for not publishing that information.”
</span>Kushner says he brought the email to the attention of a Secret Service agent he was traveling with, who advised him “to ignore it and not to reply — which is what I did.”
Kushner also details two interactions with Russian officials during the transition period, before Trump was sworn in as president on Jan.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 20.</span> The first, on Dec.<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> was a meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower in New York, which retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who would become the president’s national security adviser, also attended.
“I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations,” Kushner writes. “Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.”
Kushner writes that Kislyak addressed U.S. policy in Syria and wanted to “convey information from what he called his ‘generals’ ” but that they could not come to the United States and “he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation.”
Kushner continues that he or Flynn explained there were no such lines, and that Kushner asked Kislyak if the Russians had “an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn.” He writes that Kislyak said “that would not be possible” and they agreed to wait until after the inauguration to receive the information.
The Washington Post first reported in May on Kushner and Kislyak’s discussions about establishing a secret communications channel, though Kushner suggests in his testimony that the channel would have been for the purpose of this one meeting as opposed to establishing a “secret back channel.”
“I did not suggest a ‘secret back channel,’ ” Kushner writes. “I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period.”
The second transition-period meeting Kushner says he had with Russians was on Dec.<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 13,</span> when Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, a banker with “a direct line to the Russian President,” at the urging of Kislyak. On Dec.<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6,</span> the Russian Embassy asked Kushner to meet with Kislyak on Dec.<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,</span> and Kushner declined, he writes. They asked if he could meet on Dec.<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 6 and</span> Kushner declined again, he writes. Kislyak then requested a meeting with Kushner’s assistant — “and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed,” Kushner writes.
Kislyak and Kushner’s assistant, whom Kushner does not name in his testimony, met on Dec.<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12,</span> where Kislyak requested that Kushner meet with Gorkov, “who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.”
Kushner agreed to meet Gorkov, making room in his schedule for him the next day. Their meeting <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lasted 20 to</span><span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 25 minutes</span>, Kushner writes, and Gorkov presented two gifts — a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where Kushner’s grandparents were from in Belarus, and a bag of dirt from there. Kushner then gave the gifts to his assistant and asked him to formally register them with the transition office.
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">During the meeting, Kushner writes, Gorkov told him about his bank and discussed the Russian economy, expressing “disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future.”</span> Kushner writes that “no specific policies were discussed,” including sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.
At the end of his testimony, Kushner offers an explanation for failing to disclose all of his foreign government contacts on his SF-86 application for security clearance. He writes that his form was “prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials.”
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Kushner describes a frenzied period disentangling from his real estate business and moving his family to Washington during which a “rough draft” of his form was submitted by his assistant because of a “miscommunication.”</span> Kushner writes that the initial submission omitted “all foreign contacts” and that a supplemental submission disclosed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 contacts</span> from more <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 countries</span>."
