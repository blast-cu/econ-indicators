Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut it\u2019s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.\n</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Powell has openly admitted that there\u2019s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But the members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors said they think they\u2019ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The unemployment rate <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed\u2019s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year \u2015 still historically high but down <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=\"4\"

Federal Reserve Is Trying \u2018To Get More People Fired\u2019</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is coming under increasing political pressure to stop raising interest rates as aggressively as it has done so this year.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced another rate hike Wednesday as Democrats worry Powell\u2019s monetary policy will cause a recession.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe\u2019s pushing hard to get more people fired because he thinks that is one way to help bring down inflation,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cBut it\u2019s sure painful for the families who lose their jobs.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Fed fights inflation through interest rate hikes that make money more expensive to borrow, resulting in people having less to spend, forcing companies to lower their prices to attract cash-strapped consumers.\n</span>The problem is that if spending slows too much, businesses will lay people off, creating a self-perpetuating negative cycle known as a recession. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The process trades the shared burden of higher prices for mass layoffs that mostly affect lower-income families.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Powell has openly admitted that there\u2019s no way to tell in real time when the Fed has pushed too hard.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point on Wednesday, a slightly smaller increase than the three-quarter-percent increases the central bank announced several times earlier this year.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But the members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors said they think they\u2019ll ultimately have to raise rates higher than previously expected.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">So far, higher interest rates have crushed home sales, which are highly sensitive to borrowing costs, but had apparently no effect on the labor market.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The unemployment rate <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">remained 3.7% in</span> November, which is historically low.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In new projections published Wednesday, the Fed\u2019s decision-makers said they expect unemployment to rise <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.6% next</span> year, which could represent a recessionary amount of job losses.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Powell said that the projected increase in unemployment would not necessarily indicate a recession, but declined to say whether he thought higher unemployment would result more from job losses or just less employer demand for workers.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Some measurements of inflation, meanwhile, have begun to suggest that price pressures are moderating.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The consumer price index showed prices <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 7.1% in</span> November compared to the previous year \u2015 still historically high but down <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.7% in</span> October <span id=\"4\"

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nStresses in very-short-term funding markets last month suggested banks have grown reluctant to lend those reserves.</span> Officials hadn\u2019t said until Tuesday when they would allow reserves to grow again to avoid further scarcity issues from roiling funding markets.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat time is now upon us,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell didn\u2019t delve into specifics, including how many bonds the Fed would buy and how quickly it would do so, but he said the Fed was close to completing and announcing its plans.\n\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reserves dropped to less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> last month, <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from $2.8 trillion</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span> when the Fed stopped buying assets.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Most of the decline occurred over the past two years after the Fed pared its asset holdings by allowing some bonds to mature without replacing them.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2008 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 by</span> purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\n</span>\u201cThis is not QE,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIn no sense is this QE.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Rather than purchase longer-dated securities, Mr. Powell said officials are now contemplating buying shorter-dated Treasury bills.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Officials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less or no stimulus.\n\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t been completed, but Mr. Powell suggested it would be ready by or before officials\u2019</span> Oct. 29-30 policy meeting. The goal would be to rebuild the level of reserves in the system sufficiently above the low point of less <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.4 trillion</span></span> reached last month.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed wants to provide enough reserves so officials can control their benchmark federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks, Mr. Powellhe said.\n\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed policy makers set their fed-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \u201crepo\u201d market for collateralized short-term loans.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">A sudden shortage of cash in this market caused repo rates to surge on Sept.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 and</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span> prompting the Fed intervention.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1 trillion</span> in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions\u2014if allowed to fester\u2014could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and drag on economic growth.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Some current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix to recent money-market volatility would be to build a buffer of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reserves $150 billion</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or $250 billion</span> above mid-September\u2019s low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Market analysts said Mr. Powell\u2019s comments clarified ambiguity around the Fed\u2019s mid- and long-range plans.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis was a helpful announcement today, allowing investors to focus on the actual rate decision/guidance provided in three weeks rather than mechanics,\u201d said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell provided fewer clues Tuesday about the possibility of another interest rate cut this month.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered the fed-funds rate in September to a range <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.75% and</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2%,</span> its second rate cut this year.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">A recent spate of weak factory data and other signs of a slowdown have helped to fuel market expectations of another cut in October.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell neither rejected nor ratified market expectations of another cut.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He acknowledged recent risks to growth from uncertainty over trade policy and other global developments and said recent Fed rate cuts had buoyed the U.S. economic outlook.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s next policy meeting is several weeks away \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u201d Mr. Powell said.\n\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Economic data last week pointed to signs of a continued slowdown in the pace of job growth but arrested worries of a sharp downturn.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said recent labor market data has been solid, with the slower pace of job gains still strong enough to accommodate new workers entering the labor force.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell offered one sign of how market signals could shape his thinking.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Despite the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts this year, long-term bond yields in recent months have held below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has traditionally preceded downturns by a year or so.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to deal with immediately, but it...wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to be in that state of affairs for an extended period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

Weather the Price of El Ni\u00f1o</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have confirmed El Ni\u00f1o is back\n\nUpdated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 5,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 6</span>:30 pm ET\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand\u2014Fears that the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon will wreak havoc this summer have sent prices of wheat, corn and soybeans higher in recent weeks, as commodity investors, farmers and traders prepare for low crop yields.\n\n</span>Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Ni\u00f1o is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The price increases over the past two weeks, in part thanks to fears El Ni\u00f1o will cause excessive dryness in important crop-growing regions, follow a long period of relative stability.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Yields for Australian wheat\u2014which <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">comprise 14% of</span> the world\u2019s exports\u2014could fall as much <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 50% according</span> to analysts at National Australia Bank Ltd.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow down or reverse direction.</span> That warms water over a vast area, which in turn can upend weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In the past, nonfuel commodity prices have risen <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 5.3% on</span> average in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> following the announcement of an El Ni\u00f1o event, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper.\n\n</span>In some years, the effect has been far more dramatic. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">El Ni\u00f1o caused palm oil prices to surge <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 150% over</span> a nine-month period <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1996 and</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1997,</span> according to Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Capital Markets.\n\n</span>Yet there remains no way to anticipate how severe the impact will be. Of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 26 El</span> Ni\u00f1o weather patterns observed <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1900,</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 17 resulted</span> in widespread droughts in Australia, according to the country\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology.\n\n\u201cEvery El Ni\u00f1o is different, including its duration and intensity, as is its impact on agricultural production,\u201d analysts at Rabobank said in a note. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">They said the price impact could be deepest for robusta coffee\u2014used in instant coffee\u2014raw sugar and wheat, crops grown in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil that are likely to be affected by El Ni\u00f1o.\n\n</span>Garry Hansen, a farmer who grows wheat as well as raises cattle and sheep on <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8,000</span>-hectare farm in Coomandook in southern Australia, is already concerned about the area\u2019s dryness. The region has had little rain over the last two years.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of moisture in the bank and we are a little bit worried about the forecast. We could do with the rain,\u201d said Mr. Hansen, who added June\u2019s rainfall was <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 20% of</span> its normal level. He said making sure there were no weeds taking water away from the wheat crop was one of the few things he could do to combat El Ni\u00f1o.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou have to manage the business like it is going to rain but you also have to maximize water efficiency,\u201d said Mr. Hansen.\n\nWheat exported from Brisbane on Australia\u2019s eastern coast, near to farmland that could be most affected by El Ni\u00f1o, is already trading at a premium of more <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10% to</span> wheat shipped from Adelaide in South Australia, said Rob Imray, managing director at commodity marketing firm Farmarco Australia.\n\n</span>It may take a few months before El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s impact is felt in other agricultural commodities.

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 nations</span></span>, even if it means cutting production, adding to questions over whether the plan, which goes into effect on Monday, will succeed in slowing Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The Group <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 nations</span></span> on Friday agreed to cap the price of Russian crude <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $60 a</span> barrel, putting into place a complex, U.S.-backed plan to limit what Russia, the world\u2019s second largest oil exporter, can charge for its oil exports.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin\u2019s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules.</span> He said that Russia was \u201cworking on mechanisms\u201d to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,\u201d he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union\u2019s embargo on Russian crude imports.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production \u2014 which would also harm Russia\u2019s economy \u2014 questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression.</span> Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan\u2019s architects were \u201ctrying to avoid hard decisions.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above $70 a</span> barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $30 a</span> barrel to significantly slash Russia\u2019s revenue.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,\nMr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is $60 instead</span> of, for example,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $30,</span> which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $100 billion</span> a year,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said.\n</span>\u201cThis money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia\u2019s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions.\u201d\nThe United States had led the push for an agreement along the lines of what was ultimately negotiated. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">After the deal was announced, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen praised the plan.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">It helped \u201cachieve our goal of restricting Putin\u2019s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,\u201d she said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Western sanctions have so far failed to weaken Moscow\u2019s energy exports: Russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sales than <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2021,</span> buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">E.U. diplomats have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 countries</span> and allies.\n</span>OPEC and its allies, including Russia, said on Sunday that they would leave their quotas for oil production unchanged. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The group, known as OPEC Plus, appears to have decided during a teleconference that there was no reason to alter policy amid the many uncertainties in the oil market.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">On Monday, the European Union will begin an embargo on Russian oil, while the Group <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7 industrialized</span> nations and their allies are imposing a price cap <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $60 a</span> barrel on Russian crude.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The looming embargo and the price cap were the chief reasons for the producers\u2019 group to hold its fire.</span> What the outcome of these initiatives will be for oil markets is still to be determined, but they could affect millions of barrels a day of Russian oil. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">OPEC may have decided that it was better off keeping its collective head down rather than risk being blamed if, for instance, prices jump in the coming days.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The coming weeks may see an interplay between the growing difficulties that Russia is likely to have in selling its oil and the effects of a slowing global economy.</span> China will be a key factor. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Lockdowns there are reducing demand for imports.</span> But widespread protests against those restrictions have been followed by some easing of the \u201czero Covid\u201d rules, offering some hope of a gradual easing and a bounce back in consumption of fuel.\nAt the moment the oil markets are betting that these momentous shifts can be handled smoothly. But they may be wrong.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The State of the War\n- Russian Oil Price Cap: The E.U. agreed on a $60-a-barrel limit for Russian oil, the latest effort by Western allies to try to deprive Moscow of revenue to finance its war in Ukraine.</span> Here\u2019s how it will work.\n- A Pivotal Point: Ukraine is on the offensive, but with about one-fifth of its territory still occupied by Russian forces, there is still a long way to go \u2014 and the onset of winter will bring new difficulties.\n- Ukraine\u2019s Power Grid: As many Ukrainians head into winter without power or water, crews are racing to restore Ukraine\u2019s battered energy infrastructure, but Russian airstrikes threaten to undo such efforts.\nUkrainian soldiers have raised the national flag at a location on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region, according to a video published by a Ukrainian military unit, an apparent sign of Kyiv\u2019s intent to press its counteroffensive in the south.\nThe video, released on Saturday, did not indicate that Ukraine had established a permanent military presence on the east bank, which is controlled by Russian forces. Nor did it indicate any concerted effort by Ukrainian forces who recently reclaimed Kherson city to push across the river and attack Russian defensive positions.\nBut analysts said the video, posted on Telegram by a detachment of the Ukrainian military\u2019s \u201cCarlson\u201d air intelligence unit, signaled Ukraine\u2019s desire to show it would continue its southern counteroffensive even as falling temperatures make fighting more challenging, and as Russian forces continue to fire from their eastern positions toward Kherson city.\nThe video, set to swelling music and apparently filmed with the intention of sending a message, shows soldiers on three speedboats crossing the river, which is hundreds of yards wide, and docking at an abandoned wooden jetty on an island where small civilian boats were moored. Aerial footage shows the Ukrainian flag draped from high on a crane in the wharf, which the video says is in Olezhky, a district opposite Kherson city. The timing and authenticity of the footage could not be independently confirmed.\n\u201cThis flag was raised by the fighters of the \u2018Carlson\u2019 special unit. It will become a bridgehead for the de-occupation of the left bank of the Kherson region,\u201d an unidentified man in military fatigues said. The left bank refers to the river\u2019s eastern bank.\nThe area on which the troops landed appeared to be empty, which is consistent with previous Ukrainian and other military reports that Russian forces had largely pulled back from the shoreline northeast of the city of Kherson. The location appeared to be a low-lying, swampy area with few roads, which analysts say Russian forces were unlikely to defend \u2014 and which was not a logical starting point for a Ukrainian military push.\nStill, the Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said that if confirmed, the \u201climited Ukrainian incursion onto the east bank could open avenues for Ukrainian forces to begin to operate on the east bank.\u201d\nWhen Ukraine entered Kherson city three weeks ago after Russian forces withdrew \u2014 a watershed moment in the nine-month war \u2014 its troops secured the whole of the western bank of the river in the region.

The river presents a formidable barrier, and the main bridge across, the Antonivsky, is destroyed. Analysts also say that Russian forces withdrew largely intact from Kherson and have spent weeks digging defensive barriers on the eastern side of the Dnipro. The onset of winter, too, has made military operations more difficult, both in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are defending territory they have seized in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing kind of a reduced tempo, already, of the conflict,\u201d Avril D.

At the same time, Russia has been lobbing shells across the river at the city of Kherson and at villages to the north.\nOn Saturday, one person was killed and two others were injured in a barrage of Russian shelling, said the head of Kherson\u2019s regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, on the Telegram social messaging app.\nPARIS \u2014 An \u201cessential point\u201d in any peace talks on the war in Ukraine should be how to provide security \u201cguarantees to Russia,\u201d given Moscow\u2019s concerns over NATO, President Emmanuel Macron of France has said.\nMr. Macron\u2019s remarks, in a television interview broadcast on Saturday, picked up a theme he has pursued since before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> but has not repeated of late. \u201cWe need to prepare what we are ready to do, how we protect our allies and member states, and how to give guarantees to Russia the day it returns to the negotiating table,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\u201cOne of the essential points we must address \u2014 as President Putin has always said \u2014 is the fear that NATO comes right up to its doors, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia,\u201d he said.\nThe interview with TF1, a French television network, appeared sympathetic to the concerns of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.\nMr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.\nDuring his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.\nThere was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.\nDavid Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal on Telegram.\nHe said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was \u201cleave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.\u201d\nThe last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994.</span> Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine\u2019s \u201cindependence and sovereignty in the existing borders\u201d in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2019,</span> when he declared the need for the reinvention of \u201can architecture of security\u201d between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new \u201cstability order\u201d in Europe.\nAlthough he has condemned Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cimperial\u201d invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.\nResponding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: \u201cDevastating.\u201d\nDr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer\u2019s tweet, saying: \u201cYou know you\u2019re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin\u2019s state propaganda praises you.

More than a dozen hospitals have been evacuated and people with serious medical conditions were still waiting for help in homes without power and down roads blocked by fallen trees.\nAt a news briefing, Cynthia Lee Sheng, the Jefferson Parish president, reiterated that the parish was \u201ca broken community\u201d that did not have electricity, communication or gas. She said she had taken an aerial tour over parts of the state on Wednesday and had been stunned by the widespread damage in Grand Isle and Lafitte.\n\u201cI had no idea how devastating the storm was to such an incredible amount of communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like matchsticks, like a little pile of matchsticks.\u201d\nSOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. \u2014 There were several flare-ups during a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dynamic 24 hours</span> along the far-flung fire lines of the Caldor fire. Giant funnels of smoke poured from forested hillsides. But despite the ominous scene, the authorities on Thursday morning said the wind was working in their favor, and that for now, they hoped to keep the blaze from reaching Lake Tahoe.\nIt was a bit of welcome news for residents who had evacuated the area as the Caldor fire pushed aggressively east toward the border of California and Nevada. It has burned more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.\n\u201cI feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what\u2019s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,\u201d said the Rev.

Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.\nFirefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.\nAfter the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.\n\u201cThe weather has been working in our favor,\u201d said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. \u201cLook at the Dixie fire.\u201d\nFirefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake\u2019s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.\nThe blaze, which <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and \u201csquirrelly winds\u201d in the Kirkwood area.\nBut so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.\nThomas Fuller and\nAdvertisement\nThe Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.\nMore <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews \u2014 sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain \u2014 build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.\n\u201cIt becomes \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019\u201d said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev.

Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.\nSoutheast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties \u2014 the town of <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.\n\u201cThe fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,\u201d said David Hammond,<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.\nMr. Hammond\u2019s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, \u201cin case we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\nIn other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire\u2019s wrath in challenging terrain.\nMore <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.\nSeveral towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.\n\u201cWe would hope that we\u2019re on the downhill slide,\u201d Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. \u201cBut after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s just hard to venture a guess.\u201d\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87,</span> was in his <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.\nBy late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back.

In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that \u201cthe size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,\u201d with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.\n\u201cAfter last night\u2019s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,\u201d said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. \u201cBoth waterways have already surpassed all-time records.\u201d\nIn Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.\nThe Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">got 10 inches</span> of rain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,\u201d Mr. DiGirolamo said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.\nOne of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.\n</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof.

Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.\nBefore you give, do your research.\nNatural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.\n</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.\nDonations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.\nIf you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.\nHere are some local organizations in the storm area.\nAll Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.\nThe Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.\nCulture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin\u2019 Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.\nAirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.\nSBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.\nA number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana\u2019s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.\nBayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.\nLouisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.\nNational organizations are lending a hand.\nAmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.\nMercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida\u2019s wake and is accepting donations.\nGoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.\nProject HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies.

It has burned more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 210,000 acres</span>, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">destroying 811 structures</span> and injuring five people.\n\u201cI feel relieved down here, but I still have a knot in my stomach for what\u2019s going on in the South Lake Tahoe area,\u201d said the Rev. Debra Sabino, an Episcopal priest from Placerville,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40 miles</span> northeast of Sacramento, who has been delivering groceries and supplies to evacuees affected by the fire.\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019m just worried sick.\u201d\nOn Wednesday evening, President Biden declared the fire an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts at the fire.\nConditions were particularly challenging in the remote forests southeast of the lake, Beale Monday, a section chief with the U.S. Forest Service, said in a briefing.\n\u201cThis is some very tough country, very steep, very rugged and it\u2019s just not safe to try to put people right on the fire\u2019s edge now,\u201d he said.\nOther firefighters are crossing Lake Tahoe by boat to protect remote cabins and vacation homes. Some ski resorts have turned on snow machines to blast out water across lifts and lodges.\nFirefighters elsewhere in the state, northeast of Chico, have reached a milestone by containing more than half of the Dixie fire, which is <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearing 850,000 acres</span> burned and is the second-largest blaze in recorded state history.\nAfter the Caldor fire descended the granite cliffs of the Tahoe basin on Monday, firefighters positioned themselves in the evacuated neighborhoods of Meyers and Christmas Valley directly south of Lake Tahoe. Night and day, fire crews are patrolling deserted streets to tamp out the spot fires caused by flying embers.\n\u201cThe weather has been working in our favor,\u201d said Jamie Moore, a spokesman for the California Incident Management Team at the Caldor fire. But things could change quickly, he added. \u201cLook at the Dixie fire.\u201d\nFirefighters are hoping an area they cleared along a creek about eight miles south of the lake\u2019s shores will keep the flames from traveling toward South Lake Tahoe and ultimately the tens of thousands of businesses and residences that rim the lake.\nThe blaze, which <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 25 percent</span> contained, has eaten up hillsides across from the Kirkwood ski resort, a 40-minute drive southeast of the lake, and Mr. Monday said firefighters were battling spot fires and \u201csquirrelly winds\u201d in the Kirkwood area.\nBut so far, he added, the ski resort had been successfully protected.\nThomas Fuller and\nAdvertisement\nThe Dixie fire, a California megablaze that has torn through close <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 860,000 acres</span> of mainly forest and cast a pall of noxious smoke across the country, has now been burning for <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 days</span>, wearying firefighters and evacuees who are hoping for the nightmare to end.\nMore <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1,200 buildings</span> have been destroyed, including much of the Gold Rush era town of Greenville. Night after night, exhausted crews \u2014 sometimes hiking miles of steep terrain \u2014 build fire breaks with hand tools. Others bulldoze through the earth of the forest. Evacuees await news with bated breath.\n\u201cIt becomes \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019\u201d said Edwin Zuniga, a spokesman for Cal Fire based in Susanville,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 miles</span> northwest of Reno, Nev. He has been based at the fire since mid-July, he added, wheezing \u2014 Mr. Zuniga is himself suffering the impacts of the smoke.\nBy Thursday afternoon, the Dixie fire <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 55 percent</span> contained. Winds had slightly picked up overnight, but firefighters were still able to create containment lines, keeping the fire at bay. Aircraft known as Super Scoopers have been collecting water from Lake Davis and dumping it on the blaze.\nSoutheast of Susanville, some residents and firefighters in Milford have been clearing vegetation around homes and properties \u2014 the town of <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 200 people</span> is among the most likely to be affected by the fire next, authorities said.\n\u201cThe fire is not over the mountain yet but you never know,\u201d said David Hammond,<span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> whose parents run a convenience store near Milford that staff members said was among the only places in the region where residents could still buy food and gas.\nMr. Hammond\u2019s family had been wetting down its house with timed sprinklers, and had passports, clothing and other important belongings packed into cars, he added, \u201cin case we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\nIn other parts of the Sierra Nevada, crews are stamping out the aftermath of the fire\u2019s wrath in challenging terrain.\nMore <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 4,000 firefighters</span> continue to battle the fire, though last month, several were diverted to the Caldor fire, which is also burning in the Sierra Nevada and now threatening communities on Lake Tahoe.\nSeveral towns in the path of the Dixie fire are still under evacuation warnings and orders, and close <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,900 people</span> remain evacuated from their homes, said Brian Scott, a spokesman with the incident management team on the fire.\n\u201cWe would hope that we\u2019re on the downhill slide,\u201d Mr. Scott, who is currently based in Quincy, said of the fire. \u201cBut after seeing what Mother Nature can do with the winds, and the severe dryness of the fuels,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s just hard to venture a guess.\u201d\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 As Thursday morning began, Ron Harper,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87,</span> was in his <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">apartment 14 floors</span> above a steadily flooding Philadelphia and wondered when he would ever leave.\nBy late morning, everyone in the building was told to to evacuate, so Mr. Harper found himself walking <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 14 flights</span> in an unlit stairwell, wondering when he would ever get back. Still, it could be worse.\n\u201cI feel so bad for the people who lost property,\u201d he said.\nThose people were all over the region on Thursday, as residents of Mid-Atlantic States awoke to a trail of destruction left behind by remnants of Ida, which struck Louisiana as a hurricane days before. Tornadoes had touched down in Maryland and in the Philadelphia suburbs, while rain-swollen rivers had flooded small towns \u2014 and were still rising.\nOfficials in Pennsylvania said emergency responders had conducted thousands of water rescues, pulling people out of apartment buildings and cars.\nTens of thousands of people were without power in the Philadelphia area, where a portion of the Vine Street Expressway that runs through the center of the city was submerged.\n\u201cAl Gore gave us a wake-up <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">call 20 years</span> ago and no one paid attention,\u201d said Frank Feingold,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 76,</span> a retired probation officer and one of about a dozen people taking photos of the flooded interstate where muddy water was lapping the road signs.\nThe Schuylkill had reached the \u201cmajor\u201d flood stage designation overnight, leaving cars across the city nearly completely under water.\n\u201cWe are still doing water rescues across the city; we\u2019ve done that for the <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past 15 hours</span> now continually,\u201d Adam Thiel, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, said in a news briefing. \u201cWe know that the flooding reached levels that have not been seen <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 100 years</span>,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd potentially this will be a record-breaking flood.\u201d\nThe mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, emphasized that the storm was part of a pattern of disaster caused by climate change. \u201cExtreme weather events like Ida are not isolated incidents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are another indication of the worsening climate crisis.\u201d\nIn Manayunk, a neighborhood on the Schuylkill, brown floodwaters swirled through the open doors and windows of restaurants along Main Street, including Pizzeria L\u2019angolo. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Its owner, Guido Abbate, stood outside and took stock.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He had put sandbags outside the business around midnight on Wednesday, he said, but the defenses had been rapidly overwhelmed by the floodwaters.</span> He and his family had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in ovens, refrigerators and other equipment, he said, and he was unable to save any of them.\n\u201cIt was coming so hard that the basement filled up, and it was coming through the heating and air-conditioning vents,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came halfway up the windows.\u201d\nSome of the hardest-hit areas were in the Philadelphia suburbs. In Montgomery County, officials said at a news briefing that \u201cthe size and scope of the damage from this storm has been vast,\u201d with record flooding prompting hundreds of water rescues, and a possible tornado. Three people had died in the county, officials said, two apparently from drowning.\n\u201cAfter last night\u2019s rain, the Schuylkill River and Perkiomen Creek are continuing to rise,\u201d said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. \u201cBoth waterways have already surpassed all-time records.\u201d\nIn Bucks County late Wednesday night, Pennsylvania state troopers tried to reach a car that had driven into floodwaters but had to postpone their efforts when conditions grew too severe. When they returned early Thursday morning, the driver, a 65-year-old man, was found dead in the car.\nThe Delaware River was still rising in Bucks County on Thursday afternoon. Gene DiGirolamo, a county commissioner, said to reporters that some parts of the county <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">got 10 inches</span> of rain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be over the top to say this storm has been catastrophic,\u201d Mr. DiGirolamo said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The National Weather Service reported at least four tornadoes had touched down in Maryland on Wednesday night and one near Mullica Hill, N.J.\nOne of those tornadoes ripped a path through southern Anne Arundel County, Md., tearing the roofs from homes and businesses, punching out windows, downing trees and closing several blocks of an Annapolis business district.\n</span>Just south of the city, in the town of Edgewater, power lines lay over the roads, a house sat a few feet back from its foundation and a Toyota Tacoma lay on its roof. An official from the Fire Department said there were no reported injuries, but the storm left residents reeling.\n\u201cFor me it was just like a flash,\u201d said Carlos Zepeda, who rushed to the basement with his daughter and mother-in-law when he heard the noise. \u201cWe tried to find a hiding place, and then it was over.\u201d\nWhen he came outside, he found his neighbor\u2019s grill in his yard, and out back there was a kitchen sink. It wasn\u2019t his.\nReporting was contributed by Jesus Jim\u00e9nez, Michael Levenson, Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz, Eduardo Medina, Derrick Bryson Taylor, Ashley Wong, Brenda Wintrode and Tiffany May.\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the date that four tornadoes touched down in Maryland and one in New Jersey.

Emergency responders in boats rescued people from the rooftops of cars. Hundreds of people were evacuated from trains and subways. A tornado in southern New Jersey leveled a stretch of houses. A preliminary report by the National Weather Service determined that the tornado that hit Mullica Hill, N.J., was an F-3 in strength with estimated winds <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 150 miles</span> per hour.

Here is some guidance for those who wish to help.\nBefore you give, do your research.\nNatural disasters create ripe opportunities for fraudsters who prey on vulnerable people in need and exploit the generous impulses of others who want to donate money to help them. The Federal Communications Commission noted that scammers use phone calls, text messages, email and postal mail, and even go door to door. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The Federal Trade Commission has tips on how to spot a fraudulent charity or fund-raiser.\n</span>Charity Navigator, GuideStar and other organizations provide information on nonprofit groups and aid agencies, and can direct you to reputable ones.\nDonations of money, rather than of goods, are usually the best way to help, because they are more flexible and can readily be redirected when needs change.\nIf you suspect that an organization or individual is engaged in fraudulent activity after a natural disaster, report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, or to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-866-720-5721. FEMA also maintains a website that fact-checks information about assistance and highlights ways to avoid scams.\nHere are some local organizations in the storm area.\nAll Hands and Hearts prepared for Ida by stationing its disaster assessment and response team in Beaumont, Texas. Its volunteers will enter areas affected by the storm when they can, meeting initial needs that will probably include chain-saw work to clear debris and trees, roof tarping, mucking and gutting flooded houses, and sanitizing homes with mold contamination.\nThe Second Harvest Food Bank, which serves South Louisiana, has prepared more <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3,500 disaster</span>-readiness food boxes with items like rehydration drinks and nutrition bars, as well as bottled water. It also maintains cooking equipment that can be transported to heat prepared meals. Donations of bottled water and cleaning supplies are welcome. Volunteers can apply to help, but donating money is the most efficient way to assist the aid effort, the organization said.\nCulture Aid NOLA has set up an impromptu cooking hub at the Howlin\u2019 Wolf nightclub in New Orleans using thawing food from the freezers of restaurants experiencing power outages. The meals will be distributed to people in need, said Julie Pfeffer, a director. The group, which was originally formed to help people during the pandemic, has a donations page. It needs volunteers, trucks and takeaway containers.\nAirLink is a nonprofit humanitarian flight organization that ships aid, emergency workers and medical personnel to communities in crisis. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It has joined Operation BBQ Relief to supply equipment, cooks and volunteers to prepare meals for people affected by the storm.</span> Donations are welcome.\nSBP, originally known as the St. Bernard Project, was founded <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 by</span> a couple in St. Bernard Parish who were frustrated by the slow response after Hurricane Katrina. It focuses on restoring damaged homes and businesses and supporting recovery policies. Its Hurricane Ida plan needs donations, which will pay for supplies for home rebuilding and protective equipment for team members.\nA number of volunteer rescue groups operate under some variation of the name Cajun Navy. One is Cajun Navy Relief, a volunteer disaster response team that became a formal nonprofit organization in 2017; it has provided relief and rescue services during more than a dozen of Louisiana\u2019s floods, hurricanes and tropical storms. The team has identified supplies that are needed and is accepting donations.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which uses volunteer labor to repair homes, accepts donations to help with its work.</span> The organization has also created an online wish list, and a hotline number: 844-965-1386.\nBayou Community Foundation works with local partners in Terrebonne Parish, Lafourche Parish and Grand Isle in coastal southeast Louisiana. It has set up an Ida relief fund.\nLouisiana Baptists, a statewide network <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,600 churches</span>, has an online form for people to request help in recovery. Its relief efforts include the removal of trees from homes and the tarping of roofs, as well as meals, laundry services and counseling. Those wishing to donate can go here.\nNational organizations are lending a hand.\nAmeriCares, a health-focused relief and development organization, is responding to Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and matching donations. Vito Castelgrande, the leader of its Hurricane Ida team, said the organization would begin assessing damage in the hardest-hit communities when it is safe to travel.\nMercy Chefs, a Virginia-based nonprofit group, was founded <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2006 after</span> Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the hometown of its founder, Gary LeBlanc. The organization has served more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 15 million</span> meals to people affected by natural disasters or who have other needs. The group has deployed two mobile kitchens to serve hot meals in Ida\u2019s wake and is accepting donations.\nGoFundMe has created a centralized hub with verified GoFundMe fund-raisers to help those affected by Ida. It will be updated with new fund-raisers as they are verified.\nProject HOPE has sent an emergency response team <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 11 medical</span> volunteers and has <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 8,000 hygiene</span> kits, which include items like shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, deodorant and first-aid supplies. Donations can be made solely for Hurricane Ida emergency relief.\nThe Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of trained disaster workers and relief supplies to support people in evacuation shelters. <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">About 600 volunteers</span> were prepared to support Ida relief efforts, and shelters have been opened in Louisiana and Mississippi, with cots, blankets, comfort kits and ready-to-eat meals. The organization has also positioned products needed for blood transfusions. Donations can be made through redcross.org, or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by texting the word REDCROSS <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 90999.</span>\nThe Salvation Army has prepared field kitchens and other relief supplies to help along the Gulf Coast.\nUnited Way of Southeast Louisiana is collecting donations for a relief fund to rebuild and provide long-term assistance, including community grants."}, "2657": {"id": "2657", "text": "<h3>A Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs: 12 Tales of Pandemic Resilience</h3>Advertisement\nSupported by\nA Flying Elephant, a Teacher\u2019s Hugs:<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 Tales</span> of Pandemic Resilience\nThe virus has been crushing spirits around the world, but some people refuse to be bowed. Here are their stories.\nAs much as the pandemic has been a story of devastation and loss, it has also been one of resilience \u2014 of individual people, families and entire communities not only surviving a deadly threat but seeing in the moment a chance to serve others. Some even dare remind us that joy is still a possibility. We asked our correspondents around the world to share stories they have run across this year that speak to the strength of the human spirit, and to the way that disruption can bring out the best in us.\nBRAZIL\n\u201cI am yearning for your hug. . .\u201d\n. . . wrote the third grader. A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.\nThey had <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.\nStudents with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.\nBut the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision. Then she wrapped her arms around each one and lifted them off the ground for a long, tender embrace.\nYasmim Vit\u00f3ria de Oliveira said she missed the museum outings and classroom pajama parties that Ms. Silva used to organize.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful and she lets us have fun,\u201d the 9-year-old said.\nMs. Silva said that once the pandemic passes, she will hug her students with abandon, never again taking for granted the healing power of touch.\n\u201cIn a moment of tragedy, we\u2019ve been able to share moments of love,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThat is very powerful \u2014 Ernesto Londo\u00f1o and Manuela Andreoni\nINDIA\nWhen India\u2019s lockdown hit . . .\n. . . Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused. The answer was so obvious.\n\u201cWho else would take care of them?\u201d he said. \u2014 Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj\nITALY\nWhen an Italian bookstore appealed . . .\n. . . for volunteers to read stories or poems to elderly and homebound people locked in by the virus, they figured a few bookworms might heed the call.\n\u201cWe wanted to reach people who are isolated in this moment and might be feeling alone,\u201d said Samanta Romanese, who works at the Ubik bookstore, a local institution in the northeastern seaport city of Trieste.\nThe idea was that Ms. Romanese and her three co-workers \u2014 and with luck a few volunteers \u2014 would read to people for <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> over the phone during breaks, and on days off. \u201cWe were thinking small,\u201d she said.\nBut the response was overwhelming.\nAfter the bookstore issued its appeal late last month, more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 volunteers</span> signed up. Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car. But when the virus came, and with it remote learning, he made a U-turn, instead deciding to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy 343 tablets</span> for elementary school students shut out of class because their families could not afford the equipment.\nFor good measure, the teacher, Hoseein Asadi, also bought the <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">children<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span>000 masks</span> to protect them from infection.\nSome of his friends and family members thought he had lost his mind.\nBut Mr. Asadi,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 50,</span> has <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dedicated 28 years</span> to educating elementary school children from villages and nomadic tribes around Khuzestan Province. A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby. He liked to spend the afternoon walking by the beach and breathing in the fresh salt air.\nThen, the coronavirus came to Britain.\nWith older people advised to self-isolate, Mr. Pollard\u2019s outings came to an end and he has passed most days since then at home.\nFor a man determined to remain active, the year was hard.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because I live alone,\u201d he said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd you get fed up with your own company.\u201d\n</span>Mr. Pollard has also spent much of the year in pain. He was due for a shoulder surgery, but it had to be postponed as hospitals dealt with an influx of patients.\nThen, in early December, Mr. Pollard was among the first people in Britain to be vaccinated against the virus. And while he is still waiting for his second dose in early January, things are already looking brighter.\n\u201cI was most surprised,\u201d he said, when he received a phone call that he would be vaccinated on <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">day 1 of</span> Britain\u2019s mass inoculation program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it any thought really.

A few months into quarantine, his teacher, Maura Cristina Silva, could tell that her vivacious students were starting to buckle.\nThey had <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">become 57 tiny</span> boxes on a computer screen, leaving her with shaky and poorly lit glimpses into the toll the pandemic was taking on a cluster of families in Padre Miguel, a working-class district in western Rio de Janeiro.\nStudents with learning disabilities were falling behind, as were those who did not have their own computers.\nBut the text from the unhugged student, which came four months after their public school had been abruptly shuttered, got to Ms. Silva. The child had used the word saudade, a Portuguese term that conveys feelings of longing and melancholy.\nMs. Silva wondered if she could find a way to safely embrace her students.\nHer first idea was to use a transparent shower curtain fitted out with four plastic sleeves \u2014 but sanitizing it after each embrace seemed impractical.\nThen she came up with the idea of a pandemic \u201chugging kit\u201d \u2014 disposable raincoats, surgical gloves, face masks and hand sanitizer.\nThe response from parents was resounding: How soon could she drop by?\nShe rolled out the hugging operation in late July, renting a sound truck and driving from door to door, blasting a classroom playlist her students loved.\n\u201cDistance can\u2019t destroy what we have built,\u201d Ms. Silva,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47,</span> said on a recent rainy afternoon after visiting three students. \u201cI needed to show them that our bonds are still alive, even if I\u2019m not able to hold them every morning.\u201d\nThe kids beamed as Ms. Silva draped herself and each student in plastic with a surgeon\u2019s precision.

Pradeep Sahu, a wealthy construction contractor, knew exactly what was going to happen.\nFor years, Mr. Sahu had worked closely with migrant laborers in Surat, an industrial city on India\u2019s western coast, and he knew how tenuous their lives were. They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lived 10 to</span> a room, sleeping wall to wall, and toiled away in textile factories with zero savings. They barely had access to a toilet.\nWhen all the factories closed in March, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers ran out of food. The state government was slow to help. Many workers were desperate to go back to their home state of Odisha, a thousand miles away, but had no way of getting there.\nSo Mr. Sahu,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 48,</span> who also hails from Odisha, became a one-man aid organization.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Tapping his business contacts, he pressured the government and secured rations for thousands.</span> He organized train tickets. He found a family living in a garage who hadn\u2019t bathed in days, and took them back to his home.\n\u201cMy mental condition was one of a mad person,\u201d Mr. Sahu said. \u201cWhen I visited their habitats, my fellow men cried, \u2018We have not eaten in days.\u2019 It tore me up. It made me angry and frustrated.\u201d\nA spiritual man, Mr. Sahu works in an office that feels like a temple. In the background, Hindu chants run in an endless loop.\nWhen asked why he felt so motivated to help, Mr. Sahu paused.

Some were Italians living as far away as the Netherlands and England. Some were members of a theater company that itself has been sidelined by the virus.\nMs. Romanese said she reached out to local health authorities, parishes, social services and the Red Cross to identify potential people to read to. Volunteers and listeners chat a little, read a little.\nMs. Romanese said she had been inspired by a story she\u2019d read on social media about a Madrid librarian who was reading to the elderly during the pandemic.\nIn France, Pam\u00e9la Boittiaux, a librarian in the northern city of Douai, had a similar idea. She set up surprise phone readings of book excerpts, poems and short stories over several lockdowns this year. \u201cWe managed to stay connected to our readers, but more importantly to keep a sense of purpose,\u201d Ms. Boittiaux said.\nMs. Romanese\u2019s initiative in Trieste was timed to coincide with Christmas, but is now open-ended.\n\u201cIn a world that is becoming increasingly inhumane and dehumanizing, in a moment made more difficult by this virus, I believe that it is fundamental to remain human, to reach out, to really look out for one another,\u201d she said. \u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo and Aurelien Breeden\nBELARUS\nWhen I first met Dr. Andrei Vitushka . . .\n. . . it was in a Minsk hospital courtyard in August, and he had just gotten out of jail.\nHow he had ended up there, stuffed into a six-man cell with as many <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 31 other</span> people for three days, spoke to the arbitrary terror faced by the country\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. Dr. Vitushka,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 42,</span> and his wife had come to a police station hoping to find their detained teenage son; instead, they were locked up themselves.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">In November, Dr. Vitushka, one of Minsk\u2019s best-known neonatologists, was told he would lose his job at a state hospital, a move widely seen as retribution for his openly anti-government stance.\n</span>But when I checked in with him a few weeks later by text, he was upbeat. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m free, which by today\u2019s standards is quite something,\u201d he said.\nThe doctor is just one of many Belarusians who remain optimistic after perhaps the most trying year of their lives.\nTheir authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, dismissed the coronavirus as a bug to be cured by a daily glass of vodka, refusing to enact any social-distancing measures. Then he declared himself the winner of a blatantly falsified election, and cracked down on protests in the most intense wave of police violence Belarus had seen in three decades of post-Soviet independence.\nBut even as the president wouldn\u2019t act to check the spread of the virus, community groups sprung up and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help equip hospitals. A grass-roots movement, from tech workers to soccer fans, came together to push for voluntary social distancing \u2014 a \u201cpeople\u2019s quarantine,\u201d some called it.\nOne tech company, on Dr. Vitushka\u2019s advice, bought <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 30 coffee</span> machines to equip intensive care units.\nAfter the August election, some of these groups raised millions of dollars for the victims of police violence and state repression, further energizing the protests and helping build a sense of community.\n\u201cAll these authoritarian, totalitarian regimes rely on everyone being on their own,\u201d Dr. Vitushka told me. \u201cAnd here we all came together in the face of a threat.\u201d\nFor now, Mr. Lukashenko remains in power. But Dr. Vitushka is convinced that this year\u2019s pain \u2014 both for him and for his country \u2014 has been worth it. Sooner or later, he says, political change will come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living through an intense coming-of-age period,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had the choice to go through all of this again or not, I would say that we had to go through it. We had to get on this path.\u201d \u2014 Anton Troianovski\nCHINA\nHe has fostered more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 stray</span> cats . . .\n. . . <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 14 years</span> in his home in Wuhan, China. But never has Shuai Lihua\u2019s love for the creatures been put to the test as it was earlier this year, when the pandemic broke out in his hometown.\nOn Jan.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> Mr. Shuai,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 43,</span> watched with alarm as a flood of messages poured into his phone from panicked cat owners.\nEarlier that day, the Chinese government had locked down Wuhan, where the pandemic began, in a desperate push to stop the spread of the virus. Millions of residents who had left for what they thought would be a short trip suddenly found themselves stranded outside the city. Many had left only a week\u2019s worth of food and water for their cats at home.\nPlease, they begged, could he help?\nIt was the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, when very little was known about a virus that would later go on to infect tens of millions around the world. The normally bustling metropolis had suddenly gone quiet. Most of the city\u2019s residents had barricaded themselves inside their homes out of fear.\nBut Mr. Shuai, who goes by the nickname Lao Mao or \u201cOld Cat,\u201d did not hesitate.\n\u201cI just knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that loving cats becomes a life-or-death matter.\u201d\nAlmost every day for nearly three months, Mr. Shuai crisscrossed the city from morning to night.\nHe wore a protective suit, goggles and a mask, and carried bags of cat food and a list of addresses. When there were no spare keys or digital locks, Mr. Shuai had no choice but to get creative and, well, catlike, climb over walls, scale fire escapes, shimmy up rusty pipes and crawl through windows.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Over 10 weeks</span>, he and other volunteers made <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 2,000 house</span> calls to feed and care for hundreds of cats \u2014 and one rabbit. In April, when the lockdown was lifted, many of the cat owners came by the animal shelter where Mr. Shuai works to drop off small gifts and say thank you.\n\u201cIt was worth it, not just for the cats, but also so that the owners could have some peace of mind,\u201d Mr. Shuai said. \u201cLooking back at that time now, it all just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\u2014 Amy Qin\nIran\nThe teacher had <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">inherited $300,000 </span>. . .\n. . . and was planning to buy a new car.

A father of five who lives in Andimeshk, he said his conscience would not allow him to buy a car when hundreds of students were at the risk of losing an academic year.\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You will never be able to buy a new car or house on a teacher\u2019s salary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Asadi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut for me seeing the sweet smile on the children\u2019s faces and knowing I had given them the gift of education is enough.\u201d\nOvernight, Mr. Asadi became a national hero, appearing on state television and written about in local media outlets. The minister of education telephoned him to personally express his gratitude.\nHe has also inspired others to act.\nState-owned industries, the private sector and ordinary Iranians have mobilized to raise money for tablets. Iranians in the diaspora as far away as Australia have also offered to help. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">So far, Mr. Asadi said, the education department has received and <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">distributed 12,000 tablets</span> to low-income school districts in several provinces.\n</span>\u201cCreating happiness for kids who have nothing is the most rewarding feeling,\u201d Mr. Asadi said. \u2014 Farnaz Fassihi\nBOLIVIA\nThe women were about to give birth, but were terrified . . .\n. . . of the virus, and of the hospitals where infected people were being treated. And so from across central Bolivia, they called for help. Justina Calle Flores responded.\nFor months, Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife in the city of Cochabamba, traveled to the women\u2019s homes to attend to them, risking infection so her patients wouldn\u2019t have to. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">She traveled for hours by car, motorbike and foot, arriving with her face mask and gloves, as well as bunches of rosemary she used to make teas to ease labor.\n</span>In all, Ms. Calle Flores,<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> has helped more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200 women</span> give birth during the pandemic, far more than she delivers in a normal year.\nSometimes they cried and pulled at her braids, she said. And almost always, a new child in their arms, they thanked her profusely, telling her they would have had to do it alone if she had not arrived.\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in Bolivia has been particularly high. But Ms. Calle Flores, a midwife <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span> and a devout Christian, said she continued her work out of a sense of duty.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to die,\u201d she said. \u201cDying for me is a blessing, because I\u2019m on the Lord\u2019s path.\u201d \u2014 Julie Turkewitz\nCAMBODIA\nWhen an elephant has to travel by plane. . .\n. . . a lot of preparation is required.\nIt is not just the hundreds of pounds of snacks needed for the flight. Elephants have to be crate-trained. And even a little expertise in fluid dynamics comes in handy if you don\u2019t want the plane flooded with elephant urine.\nNow try doing all this during a pandemic that has halted much of global travel.\nBut on Nov.<span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30,</span> Kavaan, an Asian bull elephant who had been confined to an Islamabad zoo <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 35 years</span>, was flown in a Russian cargo plane from Pakistan to Cambodia to start a new life in a wildlife sanctuary.\nSent to Pakistan as a gift by Sri Lanka, Kavaan lived in the capital in a zoo so decrepit that the Islamabad High Court ordered it closed.\nElephants are social creatures, and Kavaan\u2019s mate died eight years ago. When she was buried in their cramped enclosure, Kavaan spent months tending to the grave, caressing the ground with his trunk.\nThe trip to Cambodia was organized by Free the Wild, an animal charity, along with Four Paws International, another animal welfare group. It took nearly five years of planning, and <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">required 180 kg</span> of sugar cane,<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 watermelons</span> and a military escort to the airport, to say nothing of all the urgent tweeting by the Hollywood entertainer Cher, who is a co-founder of Free the Wild.\nDays before the journey, there was a snag: Kavaan unexpectedly went into musth, a period characterized by raging male hormones. Bull elephants in musth can be aggressive and attack. They are also plagued by prolonged erections, not the ideal state for air travel.\nLuckily, Kavaan\u2019s testosterone levels waned on the eve of the flight. His Covid test was negative, too. And so the air passage went without a hitch.\n\u201c2020 has been a really awful year for so many people,\u201d said Mark Cowne, another co-founder of Free the Wild, \u201cand releasing Kaavan in the middle of this pandemic was really uplifting.\u201d \u2014 Hannah Beech\nKENYA\nThe calls and messages just kept coming . . .\n. . . in the weeks after the pandemic hit Kibera, Nairobi\u2019s largest informal settlement. From friends and neighbors, Asha Jaffar kept hearing the same stories of need.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">For many in the sprawling settlement, the lockdowns and other restrictions had meant the loss of their daily-wage jobs.</span> Now, they could not afford to buy food \u2014 or much of anything, really.\nFor many, government support or aid from humanitarian agencies had yet to materialize, so Ms. Jaffar, a writer and filmmaker, decided to take things into her own hands: She established the Kibera Food Drive to help struggling families, buying them items like rice, sugar, oil and flour.\nSince it began, the project has raised more <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $33,000 through</span> crowdfunding from across Kenya and globally, and has helped feed up <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3,000 households</span> in Kibera.\nMs. Jaffar said that after she started the project, many people in the community also approached her to volunteer or even made a donation themselves.\n\u201cIt changed my whole perception about the place where I grew up,\u201d Ms. Jaffar,<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was a change of narratives. I saw more collaborations.\u201d\nBut some parts of the story have been slower to change.\nIn April, she says, Ms. Jaffar was beaten by the police while working on the project after curfew. The Kenyan police have been accused of killing and wounding civilians while enforcing lockdown, and on this evening an officer started hitting her with a baton.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop until I said we were actually giving out food \u2014 \u2018I am a community worker,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMs. Jaffar sustained bruises in her hand and leg, but says nothing would have stopped her from making sure people in her community had a meal on their table.\n\u201cWe learned that we have to stand up for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u2014 Abdi Latif Dahir\nCHINA\nShe moved to Wuhan shortly before lockdown . . .\n. . . and the loneliness and confusion of the long months that followed at times felt overwhelming.\nIn late January, not long after Guo Jing, a 29-year-old social worker and feminist activist, moved there from the southern city of Guangzhou, the Chinese government sealed off Wuhan as a stunned world looked on from afar.\nThousands were dying. Ms. Guo felt alone, scared and powerless, scrubbing her <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hands 20 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 times</span> a day and video chatting friends in faraway cities for company.\nThen, in late February, Ms. Guo began seeing news reports about a spike in domestic violence under lockdown. A friend said she had heard what sounded like abuse in a neighbor\u2019s apartment. Unsure what to do, the friend wrote a letter describing resources against domestic violence and slipped it under the neighbor\u2019s door.\nThat gave Ms. Guo an idea.\nWith friends, she wrote and posted to social media a letter drawing attention to widespread domestic violence in China. And she offered suggestions on how to intervene.\nShe named her fledgling campaign \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence,\u201d and urged others to share the letter and themselves become buffers against abuse.\nWithin hours, thousands of people visited the page where she had posted the letter. The hashtag \u201clittle vaccines against domestic violence\u201d has been viewed more <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 800,000 times</span> on Weibo, a Chinese platform similar to Twitter.\nPeople across China began sharing photos of themselves pasting the letter in elevator banks, on bulletin boards or in any other public areas that they could still visit.\nThe outpouring was particularly remarkable, Ms. Guo said, because of the suspicion with which the Chinese government views any forms of activism, including feminism.\n\u201cMany people were nervous not only because of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Guo said, \u201cbut also because we\u2019re not accustomed to using our own public spaces.\u201d\nWuhan is no longer locked down, but Ms. Guo is still reflecting on that period. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">A friend is working on a documentary about the pandemic, and Ms. Guo and other friends have interviewed low-income workers and others hit hard by its economic fallout.\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for individuals to fundamentally change some problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the key question is, what can I do under these circumstances?\u201d \u2014 Vivian Wang\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">MEXICO\n2020 was</span> looking pretty bad . . .\n. . . for Luc\u00eda Riojas Mart\u00ednez, a Mexican congresswoman, even before the coronavirus arrived in her country.\nAn outspoken feminist and one of the only openly gay politicians in Congress, Ms. Riojas,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 32,</span> has faced online abuse and even death threats since she took office <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> Then in February, her father died of a heart attack, and it almost pushed her over the edge.\nBut then she thought about how much pride her father had taken in her work, and decided to carry on. \u201cRemember what you have to do tomorrow,\u201d she told herself.\nAt the end of March, the Mexican government declared a health emergency. Like people around the world, Ms. Riojas found herself working from home.\nBut lockdown was not a simple matter for many others in the conservative country\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. community. Endless days at home with homophobic family members often became untenable, and Ms. Riojas began hearing stories of people ending up on the street.\nAnd so the congresswoman converted the headquarters of her political organization, Ahora, into a homeless shelter for young L.G.B.T.Q. people, the first of its kind in Mexico City. With support from activists and others in the community, they took in their first two residents on <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 13.</span> Since then, the shelter now known as Casa Frida has had more <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 60 people</span> pass through its doors.\nMs. Riojas soon realized that providing shelter wasn\u2019t enough, that there was a \u201cmental and emotional health crisis in the community,\u201d she said.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Casa Frida now offers residents psychological counseling and help gaining access to health care, housing and stable work.</span> On average, most people stay between a month and a half to three months before getting back on their feet.\n\u201cMore than a shelter, we want to build a house of community,\u201d Ms. Riojas said.\nRun largely through donations and volunteers, Casa Frida moved in September, from the Ahora offices to a more permanent home in the neighborhood of Iztapalapa.\n\u201cEvery day we know that the road gets harder, but we can\u2019t take a step backward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s forward \u2014 and it\u2019s together.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Lopez\nBRITAIN\nAt <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 90,</span> John Pollard excels at resilience . . .\n. . . but now comes the reward.\nIn recent summers, Mr. Pollard had come to enjoy the small pleasure of taking the local bus from his home in Brighton to the seaside nearby.

To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

Fighting for Domestic Workers\u2019 Rights</span> Why Aren\u2019t Women Advancing More in Corporate America?\nWhat happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them?\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Before Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life, he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents\u2019 home in Santa Monica.</span> Outside, sun poured down; inside, he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside. To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big \u2014 it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling. He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2017.</span> For a few months, he took some classes at a local community college, but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home. During the day, he slept; at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC, or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes (Java, Perl, Rust, C++ and C#) he taught himself in high school. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Finally, last November, his parents insisted that he get a job \u2014 any job, at the bakery down the street or at McDonald\u2019s, if it came to that.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Hirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service, which would require, he sensed, a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">He remembered that in September, he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon, which specializes in hiring people who are, like Hirasuna, on the autism spectrum.</span> He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office, and in early January, he forced himself to make the 10-minute drive to Auticon\u2019s office two blocks from the beach. After going upstairs to the right floor, he stood outside the door of the office, stymied by what to do next.\nGiven a few hours, Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him, but this particular script was elusive. Did he open the door and barge right in? \u201cIt seemed kind of rude,\u201d Hirasuna said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, here I am!\u2019 \u201d A mass of soft, pale brown curls surrounds his head, cloudlike. As he recalled this moment of indecision, he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times. \u201cIt was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me,\u201d he recalled. Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door? What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it? Hesitating in the hall, he feared he would just stand there forever, blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity \u2014 to do work he might actually like \u2014 in a disastrous moment of total self-conflagration, his head exploding with uncertainty. And then it happened. Someone opened the door.\nOffices, for plenty of people, can occasionally be overwhelming, crowded with feelings too big for cubicles, too personal for a professional setting. A higher-up checks a watch midconversation; a comment in a meeting is talked over; someone and someone else go to lunch. Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight, every interpersonal hurdle.\nAnd then there are people like Hirasuna, who are on the autism spectrum; people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues, all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning. For some people with autism, socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules, so that any small decision \u2014 hover outside the boss\u2019s office? don\u2019t hover? \u2014 poses an insurmountable challenge. Guesswork is prevalent, misapprehension the norm. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen it is hard to read the room, so to speak, it does morph into anxiety over time,\u201d said Grey Patton, a 23-year-old employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California, Riverside, last spring and who, like Hirasuna, started working at Auticon in January.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s moving in the dark without a flashlight.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among college-educated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No good national data exist, but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic, says Paul Shattuck, a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Anxiety, commonly experienced in people with autism, can make typical workplace competition unbearable; one Auticon employee, in a BBC report, compared his experience at his last job to the television show \u201cSurvivor.\u201d</span> The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether. (Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as \u201cautistic.\u201d Others, including those I interviewed at Auticon, preferred to be described as \u201con the spectrum\u201d or as \u201ca person with autism.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t call me late for dinner,\u201d said one who did not have a preference.)\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Major technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum, recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market.</span> Human-resource departments have modified interview processes, trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities (to sounds or disruptions) and helped co-workers and managers adjust to those colleagues\u2019 needs (for example, closer supervision). Auticon goes one step further; it is an office where people who have autism are a majority. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company; instead, they define the predominant culture.\n</span>Many businesses that recruit people with autism specialize, like Auticon, in quality assurance, which is like a poultry-inspection service for software. Is the log-in working on the home page? What happens if someone right-clicks on this other link? The work can be rote and entry-level or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically, \u201cessentially to see if I can break it,\u201d as Hirasuna put it.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism, Gray Benoist, a father of two sons on the spectrum, plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his children\u2019s future.</span> He knew they were smart and capable; he also knew, as he put it, \u201cthat they present themselves in ways that may not be corporate-America kinds of ways.\u201d <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">He moved his family from St. Louis, where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrial-product business, and started over in Santa Monica, to create a software quality-assurance business that expanded its offerings over time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">With a few partners, he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee well-being are as essential to their mission as profit.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Within five years, the business was thriving, with two offices, one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 32 employees</span>, ranging from entry-level trainees to skilled automation analysts, all of whom were on the spectrum, as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators.</span> (With time, says Rebecca Beam, Auticon\u2019s president, the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles, breaking down that division.) <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2018,</span> Auticon, a German company based in Munich, a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum, acquired Benoist\u2019s start-up.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The name MindSpark nicely matched the feel-good ingenuity of the business; Auticon, on the other hand, summons the image of an army of automatons, defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency.</span> Auticon\u2019s marketing material names \u201cpattern recognition\u201d and \u201cuncompromised honesty\u201d as valued skill sets in autistic people. In fact, research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition, relative to peers of equivalent I.Q., and the range of talents (and honesty) is highly individual. Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations \u2014 even stereotypes \u2014 in the name of overcoming bias, a complicated compromise, if a strategic one.\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">A business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges, but to be the norm in an office, rather than an exception, is an unqualified relief for many of Auticon\u2019s employees.</span> Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work, when he was writing an email to his manager. \u201cI realized after the first day, Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff,\u201d he said. In college, he hated emailing his professors, because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate. At Auticon, he said, he felt a release in simply writing an email, reading it over for typos and sending it out. What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tone-deaf email? \u201c \u2018That\u2019s autism!\u2019 \u201d Hirasuna said with a big, comedic shrug. \u201c \u2018O.K. \u2014 that\u2019s what we expected!\u2019 \u201d\nOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticon\u2019s Culver City office, Mirzat Musayaf, a manager, gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client. As the meeting began, Kayla,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader, rocked gently back and forth at the conference table. (She asked that only her first name be used.) Kayla was not offended when Musayaf, whose workstation is across from her own, first placed another computer monitor next to her first one, so her frequent movement would not distract him. \u201cOh, it drives my husband crazy, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut it helps me concentrate.\u201d <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">(Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings; <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1990 Fortune</span> article noted that some of his employees, when engaging in intense conversation, did the same, as if emulating his movement.)\n</span>Musayaf\u2019s agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week. Kayla believed a colleague, who was also sitting at the table, had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way. As the conversation turned to that issue, the colleague started wringing his hands. His lower jaw jutted out, and he gritted his teeth. He asked a question, then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said, then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla: she was at fault for this issue, he explained, not him. The issue was minor, his reaction stark and defensive; no self-conscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point. It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw, unedited form.\nLater, in an email to me, Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile, she, as someone also on the spectrum, did not. \u201cI knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand and respect each other.\u201d\nMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless; he understood the colleague\u2019s strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait. Musayaf, like the other managers, known as leads, had received a few three-hour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum, but he was hardly an expert; that he was drawn to the work at Auticon, despite other options, suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team well.\nMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on, Kayla\u2019s colleague was still distressed. Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no correct way, or incorrect.\u201d He explained, gently, that his only objective was to keep the project on track. The colleague visibly relaxed.\nA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Rebecca Beam, a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year, sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk; they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy, Beam\u2019s terrier mix; but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing, a nicety they might as well endure, if only for practice.\n</span>Before working for the company, Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">But before she was put in charge of Auticon\u2019s United States business in <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018,</span> she hadn\u2019t known the staff well enough to realize, as she eventually did, that every decision, no matter how small, mattered.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">In her first weeks on the job, Mead made what turned out to be a bold move: She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover, trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway, a smattering of succulents, some framed posters of illustrated animals.</span> Over a weekend, she also had a wall, once white, painted gray.\nThat Monday, Max Gadson, a 24-year-old analyst who has been with the company for two years, arrived at the office and stopped short, taking in all this newness. He knew something was happening \u2014 they had been told to clear their desks \u2014 but no one knew exactly what. No one said anything about the wall being painted, much less that it would be gray, and here it was Monday, and now, boom! Gray wall. Gadson does not have obsessive-compulsive disorder, but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that, the sense that something was out of order. He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it through.\nAnother co-worker, Gray Benoist Jr. (the son of MindSpark\u2019s founder), who <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span></span> took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area. <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The chair would later prove popular \u2014 some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair, for fear someone will sit too close to them \u2014 but certainly, in the beginning, Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts.</span> One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when, as he sees it, they were so clearly superfluous. On another occasion, she moved a young man\u2019s desk without consulting him, and he temporarily quit. For most of Beam\u2019s staff, she realized over time, there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise (unless it\u2019s pizza).\n\u201cPeople with my type of disorder, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have emotion,\u201d Gadson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we have too much emotion. We can\u2019t push that stuff back.\u201d\nBeam, as she started to understand the office\u2019s workings, gave a lot of thought, in her first month, to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City, until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">She knew that if she bought one that was long, employees would sleep on it and not just doze, sitting, with their eyes closed, but stretch out and slumber deeply.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Many of her employees have poor sleep habits; some are on medication that can affect their sleep.</span> (Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression, according to <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2015 Kaiser</span> Permanente study <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,500 people</span> on the autism spectrum.) Would Auticon, going forward, be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room, so long as you made it back to your desk on time? Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate? In the end, Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space: She bought the big couch. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">At lunch, someone is usually napping on it, even when other employees are playing Ping-Pong on the conference table, their jackets strewn across it for a net.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Accommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon.</span> At the Culver City office, overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights, so that often, by the end of the day, they are all working in pitch darkness, rectangles of soft, bright light from their computers illuminating their faces. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Absences, in general, are not encouraged, but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Managers adjust, within reason, to their employees\u2019 boundaries, rather than the other way around, such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems \u2014 a little-understood but common issue for some people on the spectrum \u2014 call in to explain, in great detail, why they won\u2019t be coming in that day.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Another employee had disappeared, without notice, for several days, and his managers were afraid for his safety.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou know, some employers would say to someone like that, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 \u201d</span> Beam said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to work with that person and work with that person, because I see the potential.\u201d\nBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale, a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Gale, in one instance, came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully.</span> \u201cIt was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious \u2014 I could see it \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t able to process what it was he was being told,\u201d she said. He was rubbing his hands on his knees, rocking, repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Ultimately, they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer open-ended questions to confirm that the employee understood, and the analyst, instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation, would ask follow-up questions by email or Slack.</span> The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions, rather than having the staff member take notes while listening. The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address it.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Some Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success, even for analysts in entry-level jobs.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college, people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with short-term memory challenges (and some with both).</span> Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloat.\n<span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cI kind of like it here,\u201d Hirasuna said, a month into his job.</span> He was learning new programming skills he wouldn\u2019t have acquired on his own. He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also, he had to admit, some relief. As workplaces go, this one was relatively painless: \u201cThey accept me as I am.\u201d\n<span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">At the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January, several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party, while a software analyst sat silently, unmoving, unspeaking, watching for the duration of the two-hour gathering; another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with him.\n</span>In the middle of the main room, several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes, a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter. \u201cHorus,\u201d said one competitor named Will Collett,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 31,</span> recognizing the half-falcon, half-man image of the Egyptian god. He spotted a medieval weapon: \u201cHalberd.\u201d <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Before he worked at Auticon, Collett\u2019s previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fast-food restaurant, which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he grasps.\n</span>A few feet from that game, Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door. Patton, sweet-faced and floppy-haired, his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party, needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume. As a college student, he said, he attended a party \u2014 once. \u201cIt felt really claustrophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, O.K., I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza, which he was now eating in peace. Patton could at least be fairly sure, at Auticon, that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did not.\n<span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">The night of the party, Auticon employees could see, if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom, another office across a courtyard.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 well</span>-dressed employees.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">The office was the corporate headquarters of a fast-casual vegetarian-restaurant business, and its employees looked well suited to the work \u2014 fit, tan but not too tan, as if they had all chosen just the right amount of S.P.F. One person was usually talking at a time; everyone else looked listless.</span> The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted, the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room. The office space looked like a diorama of the world\u2019s worst meeting \u2014 interminable, held at the end of the day, in a too-small, harshly lit room.\nThe next evening, the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room. In the Auticon office, across the way, the room was, at 5:30, silent and dark, so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it. Earlier in the day, the room, though quiet, practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus; by early evening, that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy. Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter. She had been telling her colleague \u2014 the one who had bristled in the meeting \u2014 that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15 digits</span> on the back of her car. The colleague sent a message on Slack: \u201cI prefer this number:<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.87298334621.</span>\u201d The note made her laugh, even though she wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the square root <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 15,</span>\u201d he told her. She burst out laughing again.\nThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard, which seemed to have struck a few people the same way: with a feeling of sympathy. They had to execute tasks at Auticon, but they did not have to perform charm, to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting. \u201dDon\u2019t they look miserable?\u201d Beam said. Kayla was indignant. \u201cYou know that at least some of them are introverts,\u201d she said. <span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">This seemed like unnatural torture to her, what those employers were doing.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">It was almost as if they didn\u2019t think their employees had feelings.\n</span>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

"<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball\u2019s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 111 losses</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.\nEverywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.\nIt was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise\u2019s first World Series <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span>\nBut on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport\u2019s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.\nThe shock waves have been seismic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets \u2014 all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers\u2019 signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.\n</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing \u201cto determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.\u201d\nFor some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 tweeted on Thursday: \u201cI would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.\u201d\nWood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.\n\u201cThe word that keeps popping into my mind is \u2018unfathomable,\u2019\u201d said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s me being na\u00efve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that\u2019s been broken.\u201d\nSuspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.\nOn Oct.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees\u2019 Aroldis Chapman in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.\nYet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.\nIn the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros\u2019 acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.\nTaubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.\nHouston\u2019s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team\u2019s hierarchy and demoted Ryan\u2019s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.\n</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team\u2019s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher\u2019s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.\nOver the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s investigators <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.\nEven before The Athletic\u2019s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers\u2019 subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.\nBut they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston\u2019s hitters but sensed something shady.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cAs a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn\u2019t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.\u201d\nIt was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While power hitters generally strike out frequently \u2014 a trade-off for swinging aggressively \u2014 the Astros\u2019 lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 1910 through</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> only two teams \u2014 <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians \u2014 led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">both 2017 and</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,\u201d said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros\u2019 hitting coach, explaining the team\u2019s philosophy in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: \u201cIf you go in with that mind-set, you\u2019re not going to miss your pitch as often.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros\u2019 scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have \u2014 possibly costing players money and jobs.\n</span>\u201cNow you\u2019re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down\u201d to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, \u201cbecause they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?\u201d\nThe Astros\u2019 players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the players involved to step forward,\u201d the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. \u201cTake your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there\u2019s some integrity still in you somewhere.\u201d\nThe \u2018model organization\u2019 created a firestorm.\nThe Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros\u2019 owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.\nSome in the Astros\u2019 organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Luhnow, who has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team\u2019s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team\u2019s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cOne of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,\u201d he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> \u201cDepth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.\u201d\nLuhnow \u2014 who did not respond to an interview request for this article \u2014 inherited a team with the majors\u2019 worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.\n\u201cThe players couldn\u2019t understand why the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">best 25 guys</span> weren\u2019t breaking camp with us,\u201d said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span> \u201cWe tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we\u2019d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.\u201d\nEven before the N.B.A.\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word \u201cprocess\u201d as a euphemism for tanking \u2014 a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston\u2019s attendance sank <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team\u2019s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball\u2019s analytical and technological revolution.\n\u201cTo me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,\u201d said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros\u2019 radio play-by-play voice <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2006 through</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012.</span> \u201cThey brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it. One of the most interesting parts of the process was how the fans really embraced the losing. They believed immediately.\u201d\nThe results began revealing themselves <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015,</span> when the Astros earned a surprise playoff berth. But that season was marred by troubling news: The Astros\u2019 database had been hacked by the Cardinals\u2019 scouting director, Chris Correa, a former analyst for Luhnow in St. Louis.\nCorrea eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 46 months</span> in prison. His rationale for the crime, he said, was a suspicion that the Astros had stolen proprietary data from the Cardinals, an accusation the Astros denied.\nIn hindsight, that suspicion seems prescient. When the Astros were caught aiming a camera at the dugouts of the Indians and the Red Sox in <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2018 playoffs</span>, Correa \u2014 who declined an interview request \u2014 could not resist commenting. \u201cGuess who isn\u2019t surprised?\u201d he tweeted.\nBaseball acted quickly to suppress that controversy, accepting the Astros\u2019 explanation that they were simply playing defense against possible electronic spying by the Indians and the Red Sox. But the issue had flared before \u2014 as the Red Sox were found to have used an Apple Watch in their dugout <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 and last fall teams took extra precautions with their signs, especially when facing the Astros.\nIn the World Series, the Nationals took no chances: Each of their pitchers took a card to the mound with five sets of signs he could switch to at any time, and all four of Washington\u2019s wins came at the Astros\u2019 park in Houston.\nSign-stealing has a long and colorful history in baseball, but the sport has clearly struggled to keep up with the potential for misuse created by the rapid spread of technology. M.L.B. officers monitor video replay rooms now \u2014 they did not do so <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 and the league will most likely reinforce its rules with prominent signage in clubhouses.\nBut the Astros\u2019 scandal has brought the issue to a crossroads: Should baseball run from technology to crack down on cheating, or lean into it? League officials are considering a ban on players\u2019 looking at live video during games, yet they are also working on prototypes of electronic signs between catchers and pitchers, though nothing is considered close to game-ready.\nThose will not be the only efforts to beat back the Astros\u2019 influence. The M.L.B. players\u2019 union hopes to discourage tanking in the next collective bargaining agreement, and the Astros\u2019 model may already be losing its appeal. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Most imitators have not seen the same results, and this winter\u2019s robust free-agent market \u2014 after two slow off-seasons \u2014 seems to indicate that more teams are trying to be competitive.\n</span>The Astros should still be a force on the field this season, if their talent can overcome the organizational upheaval, the public skepticism over their achievements and the newfound awkwardness of their place within the players\u2019 fraternity. In any case, the scandal has disgraced the dominant team of this era \u2014 and threatens to swallow up the game.\n\u201cNone of us, if we looked ourselves in the mirror, would have said, \u2018Wow, these guys are morally corrupt, these guys are cheaters,\u2019\u201d said one general manager, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss another team. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, they were the model organization. But we know more now.\u201d\nDavid Waldstein and James Wagner contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Houston Astros</h3>The Houston Astros took four years to mutate from baseball\u2019s worst team to its best. But even at their lowest point, as they stumbled to a franchise-<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">record 111 losses</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> they constantly emphasized their brand of ambition.\nEverywhere they went that season, the Astros took an upright, game show-style spinning wheel for their clubhouse. Words like \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d filled the slots. So did an image of the World Series trophy.\nIt was a gimmick to encourage the players: Keep pushing the wheel in hopes of a breakthrough. The club soared to the pinnacle of the sport, propelled by an unapologetic desire to change the game, and won the franchise\u2019s first World Series <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span>\nBut on Monday, a scathing report by Major League Baseball exposed the Astros as cheaters, trashing their reputation, ousting their leaders and igniting the sport\u2019s biggest scandal since the steroid revelations of the 2000s.\nThe shock waves have been seismic. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Three managers and one general manager have lost their jobs: A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow of the Astros, Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox and Carlos Beltran of the Mets \u2014 all implicated in a brazen scheme to illegally use electronics to steal opposing catchers\u2019 signs and tip off their own batters to what pitch was coming.\n</span>So a month before spring training, baseball is grappling with at least one tainted championship, a moral and practical quandary over using technology and unsettling questions about the credibility of the competition. On Friday, Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, requested a congressional oversight hearing \u201cto determine the extent to which this cancer has spread.\u201d\nFor some, this kind of cheating is worse than using performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Wood, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 whom the Astros defeated for the title <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 </span></span></span>\u2014 tweeted on Thursday: \u201cI would rather face a player that was taking steroids than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming.\u201d\nWood helped the Dodgers win a World Series game at Minute Maid Park in Houston <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017.</span></span> In the rest of their home games that postseason, the Astros went 8-0, stealing signs and legacies along the way.\n\u201cThe word that keeps popping into my mind is \u2018unfathomable,\u2019\u201d said the veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, who played for the Oakland Athletics <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017,</span> in an interview on Friday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s me being na\u00efve, but you would never even think to do it. The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that\u2019s been broken.\u201d\nSuspicions simmered before a rapid unraveling.\nOn Oct.<span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19,</span> life was grand for the Astros. After leading the majors <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 107 wins</span> in the regular season, they clinched their second World Series berth in three years with a towering home run by Jose Altuve off the Yankees\u2019 Aroldis Chapman in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Game 6 of</span> the American League Championship Series.\nYet almost from the moment that drive cleared the left field fence, the organization descended into chaos.\nIn the clubhouse celebration after that game, the assistant general manager Brandon Taubman gloated profanely to a group of female reporters about the Astros\u2019 acquisition of pitcher Roberto Osuna, who had been serving a suspension for domestic violence when the team traded for him <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018.</span> The Astros compounded the problem by publicly denying the incident, another public-relations blunder for a team that had barred a credentialed reporter from its clubhouse in August to placate pitcher Justin Verlander.\nTaubman was fired during the World Series, which the Astros lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games.\nHouston\u2019s ace starter, Gerrit Cole, joined the Yankees in December, signing a nine-year,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $324 million</span> contract. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Astros also lost Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer and team icon, who quit as an executive adviser after the team owner Jim Crane elevated his son Jared in the team\u2019s hierarchy and demoted Ryan\u2019s son Reid, who had been president of business operations.\n</span>But the worst news, by far, came on Nov.<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span> when The Athletic published a story in which the former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers confirmed the team\u2019s sign-stealing methods in 2017: Players decoded the catcher\u2019s signals from a live video feed, then communicated the signal to the hitter by banging a trash can in the tunnel near the dugout.\nOver the next two months, Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s investigators <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">interviewed 68 witnesses</span>, <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 23 current</span> and former Astros players, and scoured thousands of emails, Slack communications, text messages and videos. Because the scheme was player-driven, there was no substantial email trace tying it to management, and Luhnow told investigators he had no knowledge of it.\nEven before The Athletic\u2019s revelations, the Astros had a reputation for using data analysis to find any small edge. They used video modeling and algorithms that could pick up tells from pitchers\u2019 subtle movements, trying to determine which pitch would come next. That is legal as a form of pregame preparation, and while many clubs most likely do it now, the Astros were probably among the first to try to detect pitch-tipping with a computer rather than the naked eye.\nBut they also raised suspicions that they were breaking the rules. Some teams, including the Yankees, have sent suspicious Astros footage and images to M.L.B. over the past few seasons. Vogt, who now plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks, respected Houston\u2019s hitters but sensed something shady.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019d go to Houston, it always seemed like they were on pitches,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cAs a catcher, when you see your pitcher execute a perfect slider down in the zone with two strikes and someone doesn\u2019t even flinch at it, you start to get alarm bells going off in your head. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing something in my setup that would be tipping pitches to the other team.\u201d\nIt was clear the Astros were doing something unusually effective. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While power hitters generally strike out frequently \u2014 a trade-off for swinging aggressively \u2014 the Astros\u2019 lineup has an extraordinary knack for slugging without whiffing.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">From 1910 through</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> only two teams \u2014 <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1948 Yankees</span> and <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1995 Cleveland</span> Indians \u2014 led the majors in slugging percentage while also recording the fewest strikeouts. The Astros did it in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">both 2017 and</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019.</span>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want guys swinging at a pitch unless they can hit a homer,\u201d said Dave Hudgens, then the Astros\u2019 hitting coach, explaining the team\u2019s philosophy in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 interview</span>. He added later: \u201cIf you go in with that mind-set, you\u2019re not going to miss your pitch as often.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Of course, it helps to know what pitch is coming, and the Astros\u2019 scheme not only led to victories but also made their rivals look worse than they should have \u2014 possibly costing players money and jobs.\n</span>\u201cNow you\u2019re telling me that could have potentially shortened my career or sent me back down\u201d to the minor leagues, Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger said in a video posted to YouTube, \u201cbecause they knew what I was throwing when I was in their park?\u201d\nThe Astros\u2019 players have mostly stayed silent on social media since the revelations, but many rivals have not hid their anger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the players involved to step forward,\u201d the veteran reliever Jerry Blevins tweeted. \u201cTake your lumps publicly. Your name is coming out sooner or later. Maybe there\u2019s some integrity still in you somewhere.\u201d\nThe \u2018model organization\u2019 created a firestorm.\nThe Astros were hardly the bullies of the league when Crane, the Astros\u2019 owner, picked Luhnow as his general manager in <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">December 2011.</span> Crane, a former college pitcher who earned his fortune in shipping, plucked Luhnow from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had just won the World Series with many players Luhnow drafted as scouting director.\nSome in the Astros\u2019 organization were more enthusiastic about the hire than others. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Luhnow, who has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Northwestern and consulted for McKinsey & Company in Chicago in his pre-baseball career, overhauled the team\u2019s scouting operations, emphasizing objective data over gut instincts.</span> Somewhat symbolically, he removed the lists of every team\u2019s 40-man roster from the walls of his office in Houston.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cOne of the first things I did was ask them to take it out,\u201d he said in an interview there, a few months after taking the job.</span> \u201cDepth charts are something that I can get online at the stroke of a button.\u201d\nLuhnow \u2014 who did not respond to an interview request for this article \u2014 inherited a team with the majors\u2019 worst record and a poorly regarded farm system. A new collective bargaining agreement had made losing more attractive by providing the worst teams with the most money to spend on amateur talent, so the Astros unloaded veterans and prepared for a stretch of several painful seasons.\n\u201cThe players couldn\u2019t understand why the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">best 25 guys</span> weren\u2019t breaking camp with us,\u201d said Dave Trembley, who coached for the Astros <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span> \u201cWe tried to develop those guys as best we could, we had early work every day, we\u2019d come out and do fundamentals. But it was a tough situation trying to keep the players motivated knowing that they were pretty much aware of what the plan was.\u201d\nEven before the N.B.A.\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers popularized it, the Astros used the word \u201cprocess\u201d as a euphemism for tanking \u2014 a strategy of fielding a threadbare roster to get better prospects and accelerate a rebuild. Houston\u2019s attendance sank <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 1.7 million</span>, a 20-year low for a non-strike season, but Luhnow eagerly sold fans on his logic. The team\u2019s supporters, in turn, embraced his bold vision to put the Astros at the forefront of baseball\u2019s analytical and technological revolution.\n\u201cTo me, there was nothing sinister about what they were doing; they were just on that leading edge and they wanted to show it off a little bit,\u201d said the Texas Rangers broadcaster Dave Raymond, who was the Astros\u2019 radio play-by-play voice <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2006 through</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012.</span> \u201cThey brilliantly educated the fan base on what they were doing and how they were going about it.

The new measure would allow the secretary of defense to authorize non-FDA-approved drugs and devices in emergencies in order \u201cto reduce the number of deaths or the severity of harm to members of the armed forces . . . caused by a risk or agent of war.\u201d\nThe two sides: The FDA and lawmakers say troops could be exposed to dangerous products. The Pentagon and leaders of defense committees say such medicines could potentially be cutting-edge and life-saving treatments.\nOUCH: \"God only knows\" how Facebook is affecting children's brains, the website's co-founder Sean Parker told Axios in an interview published yesterday. Parker said he and the website's other creators purposefully tried to make it addictive. With each like and comment, Facebook is \u201cexploiting\u201d human psychology on purpose to keep users hooked on a \u201csocial-validation feedback loop,\u201d Parker said, adding that it is \u201cexactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with.\u201d\nParker, the billionaire Napster co-founder who later served as Facebook's founding president, also called himself \"something of a conscientious objector,\" The Post's Ellie Silverman reports. \u201cI don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">or 2 billion</span> people and . . . it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. . . . <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,\u201d Parker said.\n</span>Although Facebook is a social networking site, it also has immense impact as an advertising platform and news distributor, <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reaching 2 billion</span> people each month. Parker said that when he was helping Facebook get off the ground <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> he and others involved thought: \u201cHow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201d\n\u201cAnd that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,\" he said. \"And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you . . . more likes and comments.\u201d\n--President Trump, who has blamed China for Americans' increased access to fentanyl, said yesterday he discussed reducing the flow of drugs into the United States with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said that he and the president would be \"focusing on it very strongly,\" without elaborating further.\n\u201cEvery year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,\u201d Trump said standing alongside Xi, Reuters reported. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cToday President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,\" the president said.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">He added that a \u2018special emphasis\u201d would be placed on fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 50 to</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 times</span> more addictive than heroin.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson later added that Xi \"committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information.\"</span> But last week, China\u2019s drug control agency denied Trump\u2019s claim that most fentanyl is produced in China.\n-- Meanwhile, the DEA announced yesterday it's taking steps to make it easier to prosecute fentanyl traffickers by temporarily scheduling all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis. That classification will let prosecutors charge people trafficking substances similar to fentanyl with the same charges as fentanyl, The Hill reported.\nLate last month, President Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, after first announcing his intention to declare a national emergency in August. The move allows the federal government to give states more flexibility in putting resources toward treatment.\n--Like last year, Uber is running its own campaign aimed at urging its contract workers to enroll in Obamacare.

In fact, yesterday I was looking at the White House website, healthcare.gov specifically, and I have to admit the health care plan there isn't bad. It's actually pretty good,\u201d Kimmel said on his show Wednesday night.\nKimmel cited The Post\u2019s coverage of record sign ups for what he dubbed \"Trumpcare\" and read out loud messages on social media thanking him for bring \u201con Trump\u2019s side for once.\u201d Of course, the Trumpcare Kimmel is referring to is still President Obama's Affordable Care Act that Trump keeps promising to repeal.\n\u201cIf you care about health care, go to Donald Trump\u2019s website, Healthcare.gov,\" Kimmel added.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">--Health and Taxes: The Senate version of a tax bill, which Republicans rolled out yesterday, preserves the popular medical expense deduction that its House counterpart would ditch, the Hill reports.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The deduction allows people with hefty medical costs, who spend more <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10 percent</span> of their gross income on care, to deduct certain qualified expenses like surgery, dentists, eye care, addiction treatment programs or transportation used primarily for or essential to medical care.\n</span>\"There\u2019s always a sense that it\u2019s a good thing to continue,\u201d Sen.

The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.\nWhat are the symptoms of Covid-19?\nThe virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 114,000\n</span>- U.S. cases <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passes 22,000\n</span>- What we know about the coronavirus\nSome people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don\u2019t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:\n\u2022 Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath\n\u2022 Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u2022 Bluish lips or face\nWhat should I do if I develop symptoms?\nIf you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.\nIsolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.\nHow worried should I be?\nMost people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But \u201cmild\u201d can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you\u2019ll have to be isolated or quarantined.\nBy not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.\nPublic-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn\u2019t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren\u2019t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.\nI\u2019m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?\nThe new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.\nIs taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?\nExperts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn\u2019t a cure and won\u2019t prevent you from infecting others.\nI\u2019ve heard I shouldn\u2019t take ibuprofen. Is that true?\nThere have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn\u2019t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn\u2019t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.\nIs there a test?\nYes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.\nBlood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.\nWhat if I have to self-isolate?\nIf you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don\u2019t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.\nDon\u2019t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.\nAre there drugs to treat coronaviruses?\nThere aren\u2019t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.\u2019s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.\nTwo clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.\nHow do I keep from getting Covid-19?\nSchools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending\u2014and in some cases, requiring\u2014that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.\nWho is most at risk?\nAdults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 8% in</span> people <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 70 to</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 79,</span> compared with <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.\nAre my children at risk?\nFew children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 and</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.\nHow at risk is someone in the U.S.?\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.\nThe number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.\nPublic-health officials hope to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected.

The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person\u2019s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nRespiratory droplets are heavy and don\u2019t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.\nScientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.\nHow long can the virus survive on surfaces?\nIt can last up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.\nThe study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.\nWipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.\nCan face masks protect you?\nHealth experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings\u2014even a bandanna or scarf will do\u2014in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.\nCloth masks or coverings don\u2019t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren\u2019t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn\u2019t be used on children <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.\nWhat else can I do to protect myself?\nThe most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth\u2014viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.\nIs it safe to travel internationally?\nThe State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.\nCan I donate blood?\nThe CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. \u201cSocial distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,\u201d said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\nTo minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.\nGoing back to basics: What is a coronavirus?\nThis virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.\nSeven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\nThis new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)\nHow deadly is it?\nThe overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won\u2019t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.\nThe mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.\nThe overall mortality rate may be less <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.\nThat is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 0.1%.</span>\nCovid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen\u2014SARS, which erupted in China <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.\nBut this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.\nHow Effective Are Masks?\nThe World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.\nAirborne\nLarge droplets\nSurgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n39.9</span></span></span></span>\u201d\nApprox. distance\nlarge droplets can travel\nSmall droplets\nThese traditional masks are less effective with small droplets, as they can travel farther and in unpredictable paths affected by wind and other gusts.

But they only work if they fit properly, and aren\u2019t suitable for children or people with facial hair.\nHow easily does the virus spread?\nDisease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.5 and</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 other</span> people.\nPublic-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nExperts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.\nWhat is the incubation period?\nPeople become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 11.5 days</span>.\nCan you get infected after you have already had the disease?\nThat isn\u2019t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.\nCan you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?\nSeveral studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance\u20146 feet or more\u2014from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.\nWhere did the new coronavirus come from?\nThe new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn\u2019t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you have questions about the risk of the new coronavirus from China?

The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk.\nWhat are the symptoms of Covid-19?\nThe virus infects the lower respiratory tract. Patients initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 56,000 patients</span> in China,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 87.9% had</span> a fever,<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67.7% had</span> a dry cough,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38.1% experienced</span> fatigue, <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 18.6% had</span> shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion.\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n- Johns Hopkins: global cases <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">pass 1.85 million</span>; deaths <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">top 114,000\n</span>- U.S. cases <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">near 560,000</span>; death toll <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">passes 22,000\n</span>- What we know about the coronavirus\nSome people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don\u2019t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include:\n\u2022 Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath\n\u2022 Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u2022 Bluish lips or face\nWhat should I do if I develop symptoms?\nIf you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu.\nIsolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home.\nHow worried should I be?\nMost people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But \u201cmild\u201d can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you\u2019ll have to be isolated or quarantined.\nBy not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span>672 cases</span> in China,<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 81% had</span> mild symptoms,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 13.8% were</span> severely ill, <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 4.7% were</span> critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition.\nPublic-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn\u2019t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren\u2019t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population.\nI\u2019m social distancing and I feel fine. Am I in the clear?\nThe new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, or in an average of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 days</span>, according to most estimates.\nIs taking a common, over-the-counter cold medication helpful?\nExperts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn\u2019t a cure and won\u2019t prevent you from infecting others.\nI\u2019ve heard I shouldn\u2019t take ibuprofen. Is that true?\nThere have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn\u2019t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn\u2019t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients.\nIs there a test?\nYes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested.\nBlood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection.\nWhat if I have to self-isolate?\nIf you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 14 days</span>. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don\u2019t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets.\nDon\u2019t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside.\nAre there drugs to treat coronaviruses?\nThere aren\u2019t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of Moderna Inc.\u2019s experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 18 months</span> to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus.\nTwo clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say.\nHow do I keep from getting Covid-19?\nSchools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending\u2014and in some cases, requiring\u2014that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread.\nWho is most at risk?\nAdults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,023 people</span> whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">age 60 or</span> older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 14.8% in</span> people <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 80 and</span> older, <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 8% in</span> people <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ages 70 to</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 79,</span> compared with <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.3% mortality</span> rate overall in the population studied.\nAre my children at risk?\nFew children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Of 121 U</span>.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12% were</span> adults between the ages <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 20 and</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 44,</span> according to a study by the U.S. CDC.\nHow at risk is someone in the U.S.?\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 50 states</span> and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk.\nThe number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it.\nPublic-health officials hope to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That\u2019s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick.\nCoronaviruses: From Animals to Humans\nResearchers aren't sure how the novel coronavirus first infected people in China, but the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, which originated in bats, provide clues.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n2\n1</span></span></span>\nProteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the host\u2019s respiratory tract.

The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person\u2019s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.\nRespiratory droplets are heavy and don\u2019t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 6 feet</span> of an infected person.\nScientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients.\nHow long can the virus survive on surfaces?\nIt can last up <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 72 hours</span> on plastic and stainless steel, up <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 24 hours</span> on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research.\nThe study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said.\nWipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus.\nCan face masks protect you?\nHealth experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings\u2014even a bandanna or scarf will do\u2014in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult.\nCloth masks or coverings don\u2019t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren\u2019t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn\u2019t be used on children <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 2 years</span> old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers.\nWhat else can I do to protect myself?\nThe most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 20 seconds</span> each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 60% alcohol</span>. Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth\u2014viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 feet</span> or more away from others.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say.</span> Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products.\nIs it safe to travel internationally?\nThe State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say.\nCan I donate blood?\nThe CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. \u201cSocial distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,\u201d said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\nTo minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">chairs 6 feet</span> apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding.\nGoing back to basics: What is a coronavirus?\nThis virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide.\nSeven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\nThis new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">coronavirus 2,</span> or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2019,</span> the year it emerged.)\nHow deadly is it?\nThe overall global mortality rate has ranged <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 4%,</span> according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won\u2019t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19.\nThe mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 5.8% in</span> the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 0.7%.</span> The rate in China has come down over time, the report said.\nThe overall mortality rate may be less <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 1%,</span> U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases.\nThat is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 0.1%.</span>\nCovid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen\u2014SARS, which erupted in China <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2002 and</span> spread globally <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003.</span> SARS killed <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 10% of</span> the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola.\nBut this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.\nHow Effective Are Masks?\nThe World Health Organization and other experts report that a mask's efficacy in social settings is inconclusive. But some health experts and mask makers say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus.\nAirborne\nLarge droplets\nSurgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets.<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n39.9</span></span></span></span>\u201d\nApprox. distance\nlarge droplets can travel\nSmall droplets\nThese traditional masks are less effective with small droplets, as they can travel farther and in unpredictable paths affected by wind and other gusts.

But they only work if they fit properly, and aren\u2019t suitable for children or people with facial hair.\nHow easily does the virus spread?\nDisease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 2.6 others</span>, though the range is <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 1.5 and</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.5 and</span> one recent report put that number as high <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 5.7 for</span> the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 12 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 18 other</span> people.\nPublic-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nExperts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns.\nWhat is the incubation period?\nPeople become ill between two <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 14 days</span></span> after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">ill 27 days</span> after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 5.1 days</span>, <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 97.5% of</span> those who develop symptoms will do so <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 11.5 days</span>.\nCan you get infected after you have already had the disease?\nThat isn\u2019t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity.\nCan you catch the virus from someone even before they have symptoms?\nSeveral studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance\u20146 feet or more\u2014from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities.\nWhere did the new coronavirus come from?\nThe new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn\u2019t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans.

The Rams have constructed a powerful team through trades and acquisitions, including swapping quarterback Jared Goff for Matthew Stafford in the off-season, and building around the pass rusher Aaron Donald on defense. That aggressive approach to roster building has the Rams playing for a title in SoFi Stadium, their home venue.\nIn the United States, the game will be televised on NBC and streamed in several places, including Peacock, NBC\u2019s website and the NBC Sports app, while Telemundo will provide coverage in Spanish.\nKickoff is scheduled for about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time \u2014 3:30 p.m. Pacific at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The pregame festivities began on NBC at noon Eastern, with football coverage sandwiched by Olympic action from the Beijing Games. Hey, there\u2019s even an ice dance final that will probably be rolling during the Super Bowl\u2019s second half, so don't be surprised if NBC does a few look-ins.\nOutside the U.S., some of the broadcasters include Seven Network (Australia), CTV (Canada), L\u2019\u00c9quipe (France), DAZN (Germany), SportKlub (Macedonia) and the BBC (United Kingdom).\nAfter the Los Angeles Rams left for St. Louis <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995,</span> generations of young football fans in this year\u2019s Super Bowl host city grew up without a local N.F.L. team to cheer on. The Raiders, who had been there since the early 1980s, also returned to Oakland that year.\nLocal sports fans had the superstars of the Los Angeles Lakers to idolize. They could enjoy the esteemed Los Angeles Dodgers. Many were still devoted to the Raiders. They had college football and basketball, the N.H.L. and other teams. But with the Rams gone <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 20 years</span>, pro football loyalties for Angelenos spread widely across many other clubs, including to the Chargers in San Diego.\nNow, after being back in Los Angeles since <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 season</span>, the Rams will play in the Super Bowl at their home stadium with a chance to recapture the long-term allegiance of their hometown fans.\n\u201cWhen you get a chance to play in the Super Bowl, that always helps win hearts and minds,\u201d Kevin Demoff, the Rams\u2019 chief operating officer, said at a recent news conference.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Demoff said that the Rams have cultivated the Los Angeles fan base with star players like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald, but as seen by the large crowds of 49ers fans at the regular-season finale and N.F.C. championship game, the team still has work to do in the Los Angeles market.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou cannot get to be at the pinnacle of this market by having one great season,\u201d Demoff said.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou get to the pinnacle of this market by having great season after great season, after great decade after great decade, and building fans and generations of fans.</span> And that only comes with sustained success.\u201d\nTemperatures could climb into the mid-80s this afternoon at SoFi Stadium near Los Angeles, or more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 degrees</span> higher than normal for February, which could make this the warmest Super Bowl on record. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area on Friday, and it remains in effect <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 6 p</span>.m. Pacific.\nIt\u2019s been <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 50 years</span> since the mercury was so high at a Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The temperature at kickoff <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 84 degrees</span> at Super Bowl VII <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1973,</span> which was also held in Los Angeles. At Super Bowl XXXVII <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003 in</span> San Diego, it <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 81 degrees</span> at kickoff.\nAcross the country, cities are smashing heat records more frequently as climate change widens the extremes of temperature ranges worldwide: More heat and cold records were set in the United States last year than in any other year <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1994,</span> according to a New York Times analysis. Most of those were heat records, which were set <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 8.3 percent</span> of all weather stations nationwide last year.\nSoFi Stadium is open-sided to let in breezes off the Pacific Ocean. <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2028,</span> the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which will take place during what is usually an even hotter time of year: July and August.\nHere are where temperature records were broken in 2021:\nA common refrain from Cincinnati Bengals players this week, including stars like Joe Burrow and Ja\u2019Marr Chase, has been that this year\u2019s Super Bowl is \u201cjust another game.\u201d\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s not, there are only two teams left and it is for a ring, but I think the best way to go about it is to try to treat it like another game,\u201d Burrow said after Friday\u2019s practice, the last of the season.\nTheir opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, played in a Super Bowl just three years ago, a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots. The Bengals, meanwhile, had not won a playoff game since <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1990 wild</span>-card round. This year\u2019s Cincinnati team is also the youngest Super Bowl roster ever, with an average age <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25.8 years</span>, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.\nBut despite the Bengals\u2019 relative youth, Coach Zac Taylor pointed to the big-stage experience many of his players earned in college or on other N.F.L. teams. Taylor,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\nHe said that he and Duke Tobin, the team\u2019s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.\n\u201cThey certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments \u2014 they have proven that over the last two months,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we\u2019ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.\u201d\nNine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.\nWhen Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.\nMiller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\nBlocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals\u2019 offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.\nBurrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams\u2019 pass rush if the Bengals can\u2019t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ticket prices for this year\u2019s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.\nThe Bengals play in one of the league\u2019s smallest markets, but their fans haven\u2019t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).\nWhile the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.\nAll fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.\nLos Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor \u201cmega\u201d events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.\nAway from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,\u201d Sikka said. \u201cYou should test to go to your Super Bowl party.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Super Bowl 2022 Live Updates: The Rams and Bengals to Face Off</h3>Super <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Bowl 2022 Live</span> Updates: The Rams and Bengals to Face Off\nThe upstart Cincinnati Bengals will try to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from getting a Hollywood ending to their season.\nThe final showdown of the N.F.L. season arrives Sunday with what fans hope will be a fitting climax to a wild playoffs, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams facing off in the Super Bowl.\nThe Bengals are in their first Super Bowl <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 33 years</span>, led by the rising star quarterback Joe Burrow, who in college won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship with Louisiana State.

Taylor,<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 38,</span> is in just his third season as a head coach but was the quarterbacks coach for the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\nHe said that he and Duke Tobin, the team\u2019s director of player personnel, intentionally built the team around players with postseason experience.\n\u201cThey certainly are not overwhelmed by these moments \u2014 they have proven that over the last two months,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of guys who have played in championships in college, whether it was at L.S.U. or Clemson or Alabama or Ohio State. And then a lot of these free agents we\u2019ve signed, they have been a part of playoff teams before. So these guys, they know they belong on this stage.\u201d\nNine Bengals players, including Burrow and Chase, won a national championship in college. Trey Hendrickson and Mike Daniels were among the free-agent signings who had playoff experience with their previous teams, the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.\nWhen Von Miller, the former Denver Broncos linebacker, was traded to the Rams in November, he said he cried tears of both joy and sadness.\nMiller said in a news conference in November that on one hand, it hurt to leave the only organization he had been with after a decade. Then, Miller added, he realized he was going to play alongside one of the best players in football: the Rams All-Pro defensive lineman Aaron Donald.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Donald and Miller have been an elite pairing since that trade, particularly in the postseason.</span> In three playoff games, they each have a <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 32 pressures</span> and four sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\nBlocking Donald and Miller will present a huge test for the Bengals\u2019 offensive line, which is its weakest unit on offense. Joe Burrow was the most sacked quarterback (51) in football in the regular season and has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">taken 12 sacks</span> in the postseason.\nBurrow was sacked only once against Kansas City in the A.F.C. championship game, mostly because of how quickly he started getting the ball out his hands. That could potentially help neutralize the Rams\u2019 pass rush if the Bengals can\u2019t protect Burrow in a clear mismatch at the line of scrimmage.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ticket prices for this year\u2019s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals are unlikely to hit any records.</span> The cheapest resale ticket was going <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $3,450 on</span> StubHub on Saturday. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Not cheap, of course, but well below the average price <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $6,697 for</span> sold tickets, according to StubHub.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">One factor playing into prices: The Rams are playing in their home stadium.</span> Fans in Los Angeles can see the team regularly during the season and have less incentive to shell out thousands more for one game. And because many fans of the team can go to the game without hopping on a flight, they have been able to wait until closer to the game to decide whether to go.\nThe Bengals play in one of the league\u2019s smallest markets, but their fans haven\u2019t seen Cincinnati play in a Super Bowl in more <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>. In the last day,<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 30 percent</span> of the people who bought tickets on StubHub were from Ohio <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 13 percent</span> were from Kentucky (Cincinnati is on the Ohio River, which serves as a border between the two states).\nWhile the number of recorded coronavirus infections among N.F.L. players and coaches has fallen sharply during the playoffs, measures will be in place to limit coronavirus spread for attendees of the Super Bowl.\nAll fans at SoFi Stadium over the age <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5 must</span> show proof of vaccination, or a negative P.C.R. test taken <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 48 hours</span> of the game, or a negative antigen test taken <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">within 24 hours</span>. Attendees over the age <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2 are</span> required to wear a mask during the game, except when actively eating or drinking. Free KN95 masks will be distributed on-site.\nLos Angeles County has had a mask mandate covering outdoor \u201cmega\u201d events since August. SoFi Stadium has an indoor-outdoor design with a translucent roof and open air flow through the sides of the building.\nAway from the stadium, public health experts also recommend that people gathering for Super Bowl parties take similar precautions. The Super Bowl, which draws <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 100 million</span> TV viewers, is one of the biggest congregate family gathering events of the year, said Robby Sikka, a physician and chair of the Covid Sports and Society Workgroup.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a spike across the country, unless we emphasize masking, getting the booster and testing,\u201d Sikka said. \u201cYou should test to go to your Super Bowl party.\u201d"}, "13006": {"id": "13006", "text": "<h3>Whatever happened to the expanded NFL playoffs?

Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\nGoogle and\nFacebook Inc.\nOr it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t head-to-head competitors. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They want to combine AT&T\u2019s video-distribution network with Time Warner\u2019s content\u2014from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the NCAA basketball tournament\u2014in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.\n</span>\u201cThis will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,\u201d said Wayne State University law professor\nStephen Calkins,\n\u201cand what the court says will be terribly important.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump with AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephenson during a White House event last year.\nPhoto:\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\nThe case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss\nRandall Stephenson\nand U.S. antitrust chief\nMakan Delrahim.\nMr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.\nMr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal\u2014the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc.,\nHulu and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube.

Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.\u2019s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with\nWalt Disney Co.\ninstead. (Journal parent company News Corp and\n21st Century Fox\nshare common ownership.) The prospect of a better-funded Time Warner is prompting other media executives to look for faster ways to grow.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">If AT&T wins, it could embolden rivals such as\nComcast\nand\nVerizon Communications Inc.\nand clear the way for a market dominated by internet-media hybrids.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A loss could leave the media industry wide open as programmers and distributors search for ways to adapt to changing consumer tastes.\n</span>Industry Standing\nAT&T and Time Warner already compete with different players in various markets.

buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s team says yes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and \u201cAmerican consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV.\u201d\n</span>The department acknowledges AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t direct rivals, but argues the deal could broadly harm the public because the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner\u2019s content, especially the Turner networks\u2014including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV\u2014are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner\u2019s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.\nA season premiere of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 shows at a Moscow metro station last year.\nPhoto:\nVASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn\u2019t be so willing under AT&T. \u201cWith the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,\u201d it says in filings.\nAT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.\nMr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim\u2019s motives and cited a television interview <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn\u2019t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\nThe two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial. The judge alone, who oversaw the Comcast-NBCU settlement, will decide the merger\u2019s fate.\nThe Justice Department presents its case first, with a roster of witnesses likely to include officials from rival companies.\nAT&T and Time Warner will spend a good portion of their defense on testimony from their own executives, including Mr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO\nJeff Bewkes,\nabout what they see as the deal\u2019s benefits.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Each side has hired economic experts who have conducted studies that offer dueling claims about how the merger will affect prices, consumers and cost savings.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The government is relying upon University of California, Berkeley, business and economics professor\nCarl Shapiro,\nwho served as a top Justice Department antitrust official in the Obama administration.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">AT&T has turned to University of Chicago economics professor Dennis Carlton, who has provided expert testimony in antitrust cases for more <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 years</span>.\n</span>Judge Leon, a George W.

After AT&T announced the deal in <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> Candidate Trump unequivocally said his administration would never allow the deal to be approved. After the department filed its lawsuit, Mr. Trump said he shouldn\u2019t comment on the litigation, then added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.\u201d\nAn AT&T store in Newport Beach, Calif.\nPhoto:\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg NEWS\nThere is no shortage of observers who believe Mr. Trump\u2019s position was motivated not by antitrust principles but by his distaste for CNN, whose news coverage he has criticized fiercely. Mr. Stephenson has called the tensions between Mr. Trump and CNN the \u201celephant in the room\u201d when it comes to deciphering why the Justice Department sued.\nMr. Delrahim has publicly said Mr. Trump and the White House didn\u2019t influence his decision to sue AT&T. The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly. The bespectacled Oklahoman has spent his 35-year career at AT&T and its predecessor companies. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">His tenure as CEO includes <span id=\"79\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 loss</span> to the Justice Department that scuttled <span id=\"80\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $39 billion</span> bid for wireless rival T-Mobile, a failure that cost AT&T more <span id=\"81\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $4 billion</span>.\n</span>Mr. Delrahim previously served in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the George W. Bush administration. With the AT&T case, he brought one of the most consequential merger lawsuits in a generation within weeks of taking office last fall, under highly unusual circumstances because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the deal.\nThe Justice Department has been riding a decade\u2019s momentum in court, with Obama antitrust enforcers succeeding in blocking several deals in which major rivals sought to merge.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s opening act could either take that momentum to historical heights or deliver a painful blow to the department at a time when a new wave of deal making could be on the horizon.", "displayed_text": "<h3>How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">How the DOJ\u2019s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business\n</span>Next week, a federal judge will begin trying an antitrust case that has broad ramifications for media, technology and other industries, and could affect the government\u2019s powers to deter large-scale corporate consolidation\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, left, is facing off with U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, right.\nPhoto:\nBloomberg News; Associated Press\nWASHINGTON\u2014The government accuses the company\u2019s chief executive of behaving like the disingenuous Captain Renault in the film \u201cCasablanca.\u201d The company likens the government\u2019s case to a shaved Persian cat, \u201cpale and thin.\u201d\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., next week will hear a case that may settle one of the biggest antitrust issues of modern times.\nIt could determine whether antitrust enforcers will have real practical authority to challenge so-called vertical mergers involving two complementary companies that operate at different levels of the same industry. Typically, the government challenges unions of direct competitors that sell similar products and services, or horizontal mergers.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The ruling could affect major pending health-care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy.</span> If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\nGoogle and\nFacebook Inc.\nOr it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The outcome could also affect how strongly the Trump administration, with its rival populist and pro-business factions, pursues the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.\n</span>The battle is unusual because AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t head-to-head competitors. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">They want to combine AT&T\u2019s video-distribution network with Time Warner\u2019s content\u2014from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the NCAA basketball tournament\u2014in a move to integrate different links in the same supply chain.\n</span>\u201cThis will be the first court decision on a vertical merger in a very long time,\u201d said Wayne State University law professor\nStephen Calkins,\n\u201cand what the court says will be terribly important.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump with AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephenson during a White House event last year.\nPhoto:\nJabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\nThe case is a pivotal moment in a recurring clash between merger mania and government enforcement, and the drama has produced two lead actors: AT&T boss\nRandall Stephenson\nand U.S. antitrust chief\nMakan Delrahim.\nMr. Stephenson has come to personify the hard-charging executive whose approach to guiding a corporate titan through a rapidly changing landscape is to get bigger.\nMr. Delrahim emerged last year as a surprising foil, a Republican antitrust enforcer who moved swiftly to file suit against the deal\u2014the type of merger challenge some liberal officials longed to bring but never did.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The case comes as viewers are demanding more ways to watch video programming at lower prices.</span> Millions have abandoned cable and satellite-TV contracts for other options. Some have turned to cheaper packages online. Others have dropped traditional programming entirely, finding their entertainment on Netflix Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc.,\nHulu and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube.

Antitrust fears in part prompted 21st Century Fox to spurn Comcast Corp.\u2019s higher offer for most of its entertainment assets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, choosing <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $52.4 billion</span> deal with\nWalt Disney Co.\ninstead.

buys Time Warner, would it lead to substantially less competition?</span> Both sides lay out their arguments in court papers filed in the case.\nMr. Delrahim\u2019s team says yes. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The deal would mean higher prices and sluggish innovation, the department says in the filings, and \u201cAmerican consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than

the merged firm would have too much power in the pay-TV ecosystem. It says Time Warner\u2019s content, especially the Turner networks\u2014including TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and truTV\u2014are competitively significant, with consumers expecting pay-TV packages will include those channels.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">If AT&T owns Time Warner, it could threaten to withhold the Turner channels from rivals of DirecTV unless they pay higher fees, a move that would ultimately lead to higher consumer cable bills, the department alleges.</span> It says AT&T could limit the ability of rivals to offer promotions on Time Warner\u2019s HBO, the most popular premium television channel, as a way to add subscribers or retain current customers.\nA season premiere of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 shows at a Moscow metro station last year.\nPhoto:\nVASILY MAXIMOV/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the innovation front, the department says an independent Time Warner has been eager to offer its channels as part of online packages that break from the traditional cable model but wouldn\u2019t be so willing under AT&T. \u201cWith the merger, Time Warner would turn from friend to foe,\u201d it says in filings.\nAT&T rival Comcast is likely to come up frequently in the case. An AT&T victory, the Justice Department says, would give it and Comcast a stranglehold on the industry. But the department <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011 allowed</span> Comcast to take control of NBCUniversal, creating an integrated giant similar to what AT&T now wants to become.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Justice Department under Barack Obama allowed the Comcast deal after imposing restrictions on Comcast\u2019s business tactics after the merger.</span> The department leadership under Mr. Delrahim has made clear it opposes the approval of mergers based on those types of \u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions.\nAT&T and Time Warner say in court filings there is no valid legal argument for preventing the combination of complementary companies. They deny anyone\u2019s customers would pay more for TV and dispute the idea that anything they do will stop customers from cutting the cable cord. \u201cAT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t seeking to hold back the tide, as the government asserts, but to ride an irresistible wave,\u201d the companies say.\nAT&T says it would lose money withholding Time Warner programming from rival pay-TV distributors. As an assurance, the company offered rival video distributors the opportunity, for seven years, to let an arbitrator pick appropriate fees for the Turner channels if negotiations fail. The Justice Department says the arbitration offer doesn\u2019t remedy the merger\u2019s harms to competition.\nWhere Mr. Delrahim and the government see a behemoth in the making, Mr. Stephenson and the companies envision the emergence of a streamlined rival ready to take on already-powerful competitors. The deal, they say in court filings, would give Time Warner access to AT&T\u2019s infrastructure for selling directly to consumers and, equally important, would provide Time Warner personalized data about AT&T customers\u2019 interests and preferences.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Giant Combination\nA combined AT&T-Time Warner would dwarf traditional media firms but lag behind new internet players in market value.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Market capitalization, in billions\nAT&T-Time <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Warner\n$302 billion</span>\nCONTENT\nComcast*<span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nDisney</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n156\nFox</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n69\nCBS</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n20\nViacom</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n13\nDiscovery</span><span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n9\nVerizon</span>\n<span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">DELIVERY\n197\nComcast</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n167\nCharter</span><span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n83\nT</span>-<span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Mobile\n55\nSprint</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n21\nDish</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n19\nAlphabet</span>\n<span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">INTERNET\n798\nAmazon</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n772\nFacebook</span><span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n533\nNetflix</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">\n139\n</span>*owns NBC/Universal\nNote: As of <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14\nSource</span>: FactSet\nBy joining forces, the companies have said publicly and in court documents, they can create a unique platform that allows advertisers to buy commercials targeted to specific viewers, creating an alternative to Google and Facebook, which have built businesses using consumer data to sell targeted ads.\n</span>Bad blood\nHigh-stakes litigation always tends to produce bad blood, but the level of hostility in the AT&T case has been pronounced. Messrs. Stephenson and Delrahim have taken public shots at one another, even if rarely referring to each other by name.\nMr. Stephenson on multiple occasions has publicly questioned Mr. Delrahim\u2019s motives and cited a television interview <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 in</span> which Mr. Delrahim, then a private-practice lawyer, suggested the deal wouldn\u2019t face insurmountable antitrust hurdles.\nThe two also have appeared to express fundamentally different recollections of their own face-to-face conversations. Mr. Stephenson has said publicly he never offered to sell CNN, a constant target of criticism by President\nDonald Trump,\nas a carrot to win Justice Department approval.\nMr. Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, said Mr. Stephenson indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nThe Justice Department in a brief last week mocked Mr. Stephenson\u2019s professed surprise at getting sued, noting the CEO previously said AT&T had been making litigation preparations from the outset. The government compared him to Captain Renault, the corrupt Vichy police prefect in the film \u201cCasablanca,\u201d quoting his famous line, \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d\nPeople close to AT&T\u2019s management say the department\u2019s lawsuit surprised Mr. Stephenson, a lifelong Republican often vexed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable statements.\nAT&T, in its own brief, said the department\u2019s legal arguments fell apart in trial preparations, writing: \u201cNow, what remains of the government\u2019s case, \u2018like a Persian cat with its fur shaved, is alarmingly pale and thin,\u2019 \u201d borrowing a turn of phrase from <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1992 case</span>.\nThat choice of words raised eyebrows among some people close to Mr. Delrahim, who is of Persian descent.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon will open the proceedings <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 19.</span> This isn\u2019t a jury trial.

The telecom giant laid the groundwork to make Mr. Trump\u2019s comments an issue in the trial, but Judge Leon denied AT&T\u2019s request to access certain internal government communications about the deal. The company hadn\u2019t shown it had been especially singled out for disfavored treatment, the judge concluded.\nJudge Leon\u2019s ruling could be a career-defining moment for Messrs. Delrahim and Stephenson. Both, in a sense, have pushed all of their poker chips to the middle of the table.\nThe AT&T head has made clear the Time Warner acquisition is integral to his vision for the company\u2014and equally clear he believes the government is treating AT&T unfairly.

Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber.

The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her.

<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to

Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided.

Peart, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cOur admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity.\u201d\nThe \u201cnotice of voluntary dismissal\u201d of the Yale lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut on Wednesday, does not give any reason for the Justice Department\u2019s decision. It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit \u201cin light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,\u201d including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard\u2019s admissions practices.\nBut the department said that it would continue an \u201cunderlying investigation\u201d to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.\nThe Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead. Students for Fair Admission, the organization that sued Harvard, plans to pick it up and refile it under their name.\n\u201cIt is important that this lawsuit continues to be vigorously litigated through the courts during the coming months and years if necessary,\u201d said Edward Blum, the president of the organization. \u201cUsing race and ethnicity in college admissions decisions is unfair, unconstitutional and is fraying the social fabric that holds our nation together.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, filed last October, asserted that Yale discriminated against both Asian-American and white applicants. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The government said that race was the \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in hundreds of admissions decisions each year, and that \u201cfor the great majority of applicants,\u201d Asian-Americans and whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as Black applicants with comparable academic credentials.\nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964,</span> the government said, could cost Yale millions of dollars in taxpayer money.</span> The complaint said Yale receives more <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $600 million</span> annually in federal funds.\nYale said its admissions process did not discriminate and complied with Supreme Court precedent. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department also supported the lawsuit against Harvard. But given the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Yale case it seems likely to withdraw its support for the Harvard case as well.\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, the No. 3-ranking Republican in the House, has become the most visible and imperiled target of the pro-Trump majority in the G.O.P., and she faces possible punishment from them on Wednesday over her vote to impeach former President Donald J. Trump last month.\nShe and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d\nAt home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees</h3>Live Updates: House to Vote Thursday on Removing Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees\nRepublicans are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the anger from different wings in the party over Representative Liz Cheney and Ms. Greene.

Others are wary of taking a such a vote after former President Donald J. Trump has rallied to Ms. Greene\u2019s side.\nMr. McCarthy met with Ms. Greene on Tuesday night in his office to discuss her past rhetoric and the calls from members of both parties to take her off committees. Mr. McCarthy then met with a group of Republicans who control the conference\u2019s committee assignments, but no decision was ultimately made about whether or how to rebuke Ms. Greene, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nA spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to respond to Mr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement, and said that the Republican leader would \u201caddress this with members later today.\u201d\nMr. Hoyer\u2019s announcement comes hours before House Republicans will meet Wednesday <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 4 p</span>.m. to discuss the future of Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 Republican</span> in the chamber.

And an array of House and Senate Republicans and Trump critics want to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing false claims and using bigoted and violent language.\nMs. Greene\u2019s behavior poses the more serious test for Republicans because her behavior is so outside the mainstream of American politics. The House Republican meeting will be a turning point for the party as members grapple with how to deal with two lawmakers who have incensed different wings of the party for very different reasons.\nMs. Greene seized on the announcement on Wednesday, sending out an email fund-raising blast minutes after Mr. Hoyer released his statement, asking her supporters to \u201crush an emergency donation\u201d to help defend her. The Georgia Republican began fund-raising on Tuesday off the claim that Democrats were unfairly targeting her for her beliefs, and said the effort netted her <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\"

added: \u201cWe can better target the number \u2014 I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden\u2019s comments came as Democrats pressed forward with their budget resolution in Congress, laying the groundwork to use a procedural maneuver that could eventually allow them to push through the president\u2019s sweeping pandemic aid plan without Republican support.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was part of a two-track strategy that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders were employing to speed through the relief package: show Republicans that they have the votes to pass an ambitious package with only Democratic backing, but offer to negotiate some details in hopes of gaining Republican support.\n</span>\u201cWe need to act fast,\u201d Mr. Biden told the

adding, \u201cwe have to take care of the people who are hurting.\u201d\nAs for slashing the size of the package by more than two thirds, as the Republicans have proposed, Mr. Biden said on the call

will take control of the chamber\u2019s committees under a new power-sharing agreement with Republicans after weeks of negotiations over how to manage the Senate that is divided 50-50.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the new majority leader, said he and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the new minority leader, had reached an agreement that would allow Democrats to assume the chairmanships of Senate committees that had remained under Republican leadership despite Democratic election victories.\nThe lack of an agreement, during the first month of the new Congress, created a bizarre situation that had slowed consideration of some of President Biden\u2019s nominees, including a hearing for Judge Merrick B. Garland, the nominee for attorney general.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident our members are ready to hit the ground running on the most important issues that face our country,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The Senate\u2019s so-called organizing resolution was initially slowed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand that Senate Democrats pledge to preserve the filibuster for the next two years.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Mr. Schumer did not accede to the demand but Mr. McConnell dropped his insistence after two Senate Democrats said they would not back eliminating the filibuster, meaning the votes did not exist to overturn it under the current alignment.\n</span>The new Senate arrangement is based on an agreement reached <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">during 2001,</span> when the Senate was last equally divided.

It noted that Yale had not filed any answering papers in the action.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it had dismissed the lawsuit \u201cin light of all available facts, circumstances and legal developments,\u201d including an federal appeals court decision upholding Harvard\u2019s admissions practices.\nBut the department said that it would continue an \u201cunderlying investigation\u201d to ensure compliance with the federal funding provisions of the Civil Rights Act <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1964.</span> Ms. Peart said Yale was continuing to cooperate with that review.\nThe Justice Department decision does not mean that the lawsuit against Yale is dead.

Trump last month.\nShe and other House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a private meeting where lawmakers will have the opportunity to confront her in person. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family and some of his allies in Congress want to force her out of her leadership position. House Republican leaders have been mum in recent weeks as they have mulled how to deal with Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\nIf Republicans do punish Ms. Cheney, they will be creating an unofficial litmus test for any party member seeking office: Do you support Mr. Trump and his actions, including his comments at the Jan.<span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 rally</span> in Washington just before a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol? Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d\nAt home in Wyoming, the sense of betrayal among Republicans is burning hot at the moment. It\u2019s especially acute among the conservative grass roots and local party activists whose strong presence in the state helped deliver Mr. Trump his largest margin of victory anywhere \u2014 beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 70 percent</span> of the vote.\nAt least one conservative state lawmaker \u2014 who described the impeachment vote as \u201can ice pick in the back\u201d by Republicans who supported it \u2014 has printed \u201cImpeach Liz Cheney!\u201d yard signs and is vowing to challenge her <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span> Ten county-level Republican Party organizations have voted to censure Ms. Cheney in recent days, and more are expected to follow suit.\nPeople close to Ms. Cheney, who insisted on anonymity so they could discuss her private views, said that her break with the pro-Trump faction reflected her belief that many more Republicans share her disgust with how seriously Mr. Trump undermined confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.\nAs she watched Mr. Trump and his supporters peddle conspiracy theories and promote what she called \u201cthe big lie,\u201d Ms. Cheney became deeply unsettled by how many of her colleagues seemed so cavalier about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, friends and associates said. In conversations with colleagues, Ms. Cheney has said she hopes her example makes more Republicans in and out of public office comfortable acknowledging that they should have pushed back earlier.\nHer allies said that attempts to punish her were counterproductive at a time when the party should be united in opposition to Democratic control of Washington.\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of Republican fratricide are Democrats,\u201d said Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, who is close to the Cheney family. \u201cSo the more we have purity tests and everyone has to think and act alike, particularly when it comes to former President Trump, it\u2019s only helping Democrats.\u201d\nSome Trump loyalists in the Dept. of Homeland Security could actively resist Biden\u2019s immigration policies.\nAfter a Texas judge last week temporarily blocked President Biden\u2019s order to pause deportations <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 100 days</span>, immigration agents did not hesitate to use the brief window to defy the incoming president\u2019s new tone.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents moved a 40-year-old Cameroonian asylum seeker to a facility in Louisiana and prepared to deport him, despite his claims of torture in his home country.\n\u201cThis is not what the Biden administration stands for,\u201d Henry Hollithron, the man\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThat is definitely a holdover from the Trump era.\u201d\nPresident Donald J. Trump often complained about what he called a \u201cdeep state\u201d inside the government working to thwart his agenda. But Mr. Biden and his secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, are already encountering their own pockets of internal resistance, especially at the agencies charged with enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nMr. Mayorkas, who was confirmed on Tuesday, will find a Department of Homeland Security transformed since he was its deputy secretary in the Obama administration.\nVideos celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall are still featured on the Customs and Border Protection website. A fictionalized video by the agency that shows Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of migrants as feared criminals is still on the Border Patrol\u2019s official social media channels. And the union representing ICE agents \u2014 whose top leaders were enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 has signaled that it does not intend to accept all of the new administration\u2019s reversals of his policies.\nThose agents may have gotten a lift in the waning days of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, when Trump loyalists tried to codify the influence of those unions. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The day before Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, union leaders signed a labor agreement with Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, an immigration hard-liner and the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that requires ICE\u2019s political leadership to consult with the union on policy decisions.\n</span>If the agreement stands, it could undercut Mr. Biden\u2019s directives to the enforcement agency, including guidance that took effect on Monday requiring ICE officers to focus arrests on violent offenders.\nAdvertisement\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 370 Democratic</span> congressional aides issued an unusual public appeal on Wednesday, imploring senators \u2014 in some cases their own bosses \u2014 to convict former President Donald J. Trump for inciting a violent \u201cattack on our workplace\u201d that threatened the peaceful transition of power.\nIn a starkly personal letter, the staff members describe ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices or watching as they witnessed marauding bands of rioters who \u201csmashed\u201d their way through the Capitol on Jan.<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span> Responsibility, they argue, lies squarely with Mr. Trump and his \u201cbaseless, monthslong effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cAs congressional employees, we don\u2019t have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,\u201d they wrote.</span> \u201cAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.\u201d\nA copy of the letter, including the names of the signatories, was shared with The New York Times before its release on Wednesday, four weeks after the attack and days before the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial.\nThe letter, while in no way binding, underscored the remarkable dynamic surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trial, in which many of the witnesses to and victims of the \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d he is charged with are among the closest advisers to lawmakers who will decide his political fate. Congressional aides often provide counsel behind closed doors to the elected officials they serve, and many are authorized to speak on those officials\u2019 behalf. But exceedingly rarely do they publicly express their own views \u2014 much less push for so stark a political and constitutional remedy as conviction in an impeachment trial.\nThe House <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approves $5,000 fines</span> for lawmakers who refuse to go through metal detectors set up outside the chamber.\nThe House voted on Tuesday night to begin fining lawmakers who refused to pass through metal detectors before walking onto the House floor, the latest move in a series of security measures taken after the deadly Jan.<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 riot</span></span> at the Capitol.\nThe provision, tucked in a procedural package of rules, will fine lawmakers who bypass the metal detectors installed outside the House <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">floor $5,000 for</span> a first offense <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and $10,000 for</span> a second offense, with the amounts deducted directly from their salaries. The vote came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to her fellow Democratic lawmakers that House leaders were reviewing additional measures intended to protect lawmakers and their aides.\n\u201cGiven the serious and ongoing security threats facing members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cIt is also clear that we will need to establish a 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack on January<span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6.</span></span>\u201d\nThe vote infuriated many Republicans, who have argued that the measure is overly onerous and infantilizing for members of Congress to endure. But in the weeks since the Capitol riot, concerns over keeping firearms off the House floor have not been theoretical. HuffPost reported last month that Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, tried to bring his gun onto the House floor, and Representative Madison Cawthorne, a Republican of North Carolina who spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington on Jan.<span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 6 that</span> preceded the attack, later claimed he had been armed that day when he evacuated the House floor as rioters stormed the building.\nDuring a speech on the House floor on Tuesday evening, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, did not explicitly name the Republican members of Congress who had elevated concerns about firearms on the House floor, but gestured to Mr. Cawthorne and other Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who endorsed executing Ms. Pelosi before she was elected, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who campaigned on bringing her Glock with her to the halls of Congress.\n\u201cThese words and actions raise serious safety concerns,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, calling the metal detectors \u201ca basic safety measure.\u201d\nMs. Boebert evidently disagreed, and her chief of staff circulated an email on Tuesday night urging other Republican aides to vote against the measure, calling the fines \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting."}, "3989": {"id": "3989", "text": "<h3>As Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Supported by\nAs Prices Rise, Biden Turns to Antitrust Enforcers\nA wide-ranging presidential order helped block a railroad merger and tackle supply-chain problems, and it is planting the seeds for bigger actions.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">WASHINGTON \u2014 As rising inflation threatens his presidency, President Biden is turning to the federal government\u2019s antitrust authorities to try to tame red-hot price increases that his administration believes are partly driven by a lack of corporate competition.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has prodded the Agriculture Department to investigate large meatpackers that control a significant share of poultry and pork markets, accusing them of raising prices, underpaying farmers \u2014 and tripling their profit margins during the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">As gas prices surged, he publicly encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate accusations that large oil companies had artificially inflated prices, behavior that the administration says continued even after global oil prices began to fall in recent weeks.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The push has extended to little-known agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission, which the president has urged to search for price gouging by large shipping companies at the heart of the supply chain.\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The turn to antitrust levers stems from Mr. Biden\u2019s belief that rising levels of corporate concentration in the U.S. economy have empowered a few large players in each industry to raise prices higher than a more competitive market would allow.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Corporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.\n</span>White House officials concede that their antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately.

Maffei, the former New York congressman who is chairman of the commission.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">But, Mr. Maffei said, the focus on antitrust has given the commission tools and confidence to investigate other abuses by shipping companies, now and in the future, when demand falls and companies might be tempted to try to keep their freight rates artificially high.</span> \u201cI think it has upped our credibility\u201d with companies and discouraged anticompetitive behavior, he said.\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most sustained focus, in the near term, has been on the meat industry. <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">A report from the National Economic Council this month accused the largest meat processing companies of price gouging to pad profits.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for meat were <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 16 percent</span> in November compared with the same month last year.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the dominant meat processors use their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves,\u201d the report said.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">\u201cBusinesses that face meaningful competition can\u2019t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobbying group, denied the allegations and accused the Biden administration of cherry-picking economic data.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">It said that the White House was overlooking the record levels of demand for beef, pork and poultry.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe White House Economic Council is again demonstrating its ignorance of agricultural economics and the fundamentals of supply and demand,\u201d said Julie Anna Potts, the Meat Institute\u2019s president.\n</span>The clash between Mr. Biden and \u201cBig Meat\u201d has put the spotlight on Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who held the same position for the eight years of the Obama administration. Some agricultural groups criticized Mr. Vilsack\u2019s nomination because he had failed to mount an antitrust effort during his previous tenure and instead oversaw an era of consolidation in the farm sector, including the merger of Monsanto and Bayer. After leaving the Obama administration, Mr. Vilsack became a dairy industry lobbyist.\nMr. Vilsack is now responsible for developing new rules to strengthen a law, the Packers and Stockyards Act <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1921,</span> that is intended to protect farmers from anticompetitive practices in the meat industry and to promote ways for consumers to buy directly from farmers. But the rules, which were assigned as part of Mr. Biden\u2019s July executive order on competition, have yet to be announced. That has revived suggestions that Mr. Vilsack is beholden to big agricultural corporations.\n\u201cThese markets have been concentrated for a long time,\u201d said Austin Frerick, deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, which researches competition policy and antitrust enforcement. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fix it in his first eight years. Why do we think he\u2019s going to fix it now?\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Vilsack, Kate Waters, said the agency was working as quickly as possible through the rule-making process. <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">She also noted that Mr. Vilsack had deployed economic relief money to bolster capacity at small meat processing plants, pointing to the agency\u2019s new \u201cFood Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Program\u201d that provides loan guarantees to help meat and poultry processors expand capacity.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Progressive groups have pushed the administration to target more industries, such as retail and grocery chains, which they say are also driving up prices and profit margins.\n</span>\u201cThe Biden administration understands this and knows this,\u201d said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. But, she said, \u201cI would like to see more.\u201d"}, "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html": {"id": "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
